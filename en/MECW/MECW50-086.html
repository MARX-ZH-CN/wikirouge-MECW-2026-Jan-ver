ENGELS TO HENRY DEMAREST LLOYD
<br>IN CHICAGO
<br>London, 27 May 1893<br>
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.
<br>Dear Sir,
<br>I beg to acknowledge receipt of your book <i>A Strike of Millionaires against Miners,</i> 2nd ed., for which please accept my best thanks. 211 I shall read it with great interest. Here in England modern capitalism, during the century and a half of its full development, has lost much of its original brutal energy and moves onwards with a moderated step; even in France and Germany, this is to a certain degree the case also; it is only in industrially young countries like America and Russia, that capital gives full fling to the recklessness of its greed. The consolation, however, lies in this: that by this very recklessness it hurries on the development of the immense resources of these young countries, and thereby prepares the period when a better system of production will be able to take the place of the old.
<br>In America, at least, I am strongly inclined to believe that the fatal hour of capitalism will have struck as soon as a native American working class will have replaced a working class composed in its majority by foreign immigrants.
<br>Yours very faithfully
<br>Fred. Engels

MARX TO JUSTE VERNOUILLET</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>[London,] 15 August 1872</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>According to a letter from Mr Lachâtre which reached me yesterday, I am in future to send the proofs<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>to Mr Lahure.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, Mr Lachâtre forgot to let me have Mr Lahure's address, which is why I am writing you this note.</p>
<p>Last week I despatched to Mr Dervaux, at the last address he had given me—34 Rue Fontaine, Quartier St Georges—the manuscript of Section II. He has not yet acknowledged receipt.</p>
<p>On Monday last<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>I sent him the final proof of instalment 6, which I had marked <i>ready for press</i> (after having made the few corrections indicated).</p>
<p>I hope that everything has reached the publisher's. If you have received No. 6 and made the corrections, I authorise you, as requested by Mr Lachâtre, to print instalments 1 to 6 straightaway.</p>
<p>Perhaps you would be good enough to reply by return of post.</p>
<p>Yours very faithfully,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

However, its contents and Marx's correspondence on the subject indicate that it was addressed to the heads of the Lachâtre publishing house in Paris. On 13 February 1872 Marx received a reply from the manager Juste Vernouillet, who informed him about the despatch of copies of the agreement on the publication of the French translation of Volume I of <i>Capital.</i> The agreement was signed on 15 February by Marx on one side, and Maurice Lachâtre and Juste Vernouillet on the other. It stipulated that the French edition was to be published in 44 instalments, and sold five instalments at a time.<br>The French authorised edition of Volume I of <i>Capital</i> was published between 17 September 1872 and November 1875. The translation was done by Joseph Roy, who began in February 1872 and completed work in late 1873. The quality of the translation largely failed to satisfy Marx; besides, he was convinced that the original needed to be revised to adapt it to French readers.</span>

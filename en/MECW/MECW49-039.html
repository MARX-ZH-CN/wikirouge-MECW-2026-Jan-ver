ENGELS TO VICTOR ADLER
<br>IN VIENNA
<br>London, 15 November 1890<br>
122 Regent's Park Road, N.W.
<br>Dear Adler,
<br>Many thanks for your letter. The Avelings have just arrived with a telegram — 'SEND MONEY'— from Louise who was proposing to leave Vienna today.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Aveling at once sent her a cheque for ten pounds. But since I fear that it won't be paid before it has been referred back, which takes time, I thought it safer to take out a money order for ten pounds over here, and to do this <i>in jour name,</i> since Louise may already have left by the time it arrives; over here it has been taken out in the name of Edward Aveling. According to what the Post Office says, we are to retain the order itself over here, as the money will be paid to you at your home address which was the one we gave.
<br>Should Louise have already left, please keep the money at our disposal until further notice.
<br>Your
<br>F. Engels
<br>Aveling has just come back — it's altogether too late, since orders are not issued after 4 o'clock on Saturdays!! So we shall send it on Monday.

<br><b>Dear Fred</b>,
<br><em>D'abord,</em> about the Solingen business. (Are £2 necessary here? I think only one.)
<br>These people have <b>bothered</b> me, the <b>General Council</b>, the <em>Basle Congress</em> etc., with their <b>appeals</b>. They themselves admit that their productive cooperative is only of <em>local</em> interest. How can they expect foreign countries to contribute a <b>single farthing</b> to them, in view of the <em>international</em> sacrifices that the <b>strikes</b>, etc., cost, and of the tribulations of hundreds of French and English production cooperatives? They have seen what benefit they have gained from <em>Becker's enthusiastic appeals.</em>
<br>On the other hand: these Solingen people are supporters for you <em>and me</em> in the Rhine Province. They belonged (<b>the leaders</b>) to the League. Under Lassalle's lordly sway, when Marquis Izzy [Lassalle] was in Cologne, the same Karl Klein announced a <b>toast</b> for us, the editors of the <em>Neue Rheinische Zeitung,</em> and Izzy was forced <em>de faire bonne mine à mauvais jeu</em> [grin and bear it]. Further, their cooperative was solid and maintained itself for years. The stupidity of the Prussian legislation forced them to fix their capital and thus reduce their <em>working capital.</em> Then the Rhenish bourgeois became irritable and decided to break them up, partly <em>by selling their</em> <b>obligations</b><em>,</em> and partly by <em>withdrawing all</em> <b>commercial advances</b> (not based on <b>obligations</b>).
<br>Thus, the business is of general importance and, for us, personal importance.
<br>What I suggest is this:
<br>You send the fellows 50 thaler for <b>obligations</b>, and tell them, at the same time, that they must themselves see you can do <em>nothing</em> for them among the English bourgeois in Manchester. Tell them as well — and this is a <b>fact</b> — that I in London have made <em>all possible efforts on their behalf, but in vain.</em> Finally, tell them — and I shall try this <em>immediately —</em> that I shall try to raise money for them among the <em>German bourgeois</em> I shall — naturally you will <em>not</em> tell them this — write immediately to Menke in Hamburg to this end. It is possible that Menke (who is a millionaire, and has read <em>Capital</em> from beginning to end, and furnished it with 'correcting notes', which he himself showed me) will do something. 2,000 thaler are nothing to such people. They would naturally, <em>d'abord,</em> <b>send somebody to</b> Solingen to look at how the thing works. If the business is <em>not capable of surviving,</em> it <em>should not and may not</em> receive support. If the contrary, then I <em>am certain</em> that these people (Menke <em>et Co</em>.) will provide the money.
<br><em>Ad voce</em>: <b>Irish question</b><em>.</em> I did not attend the <b>Central Council</b> last Tuesday. My '<b>family'</b> did not allow me to go in this <b>fog</b> and in <b>my present state of health</b>, although I had undertaken <b>to open the debates</b>.
<br>With regard to the report in the <em>National Reformer,</em> not only has nonsense been attributed to me, but even what is <em>rightly</em> reported is <em>incorrectly</em> reported. But I didn't want to complain. <em>D'abord</em>, I would, thereby, offend the <b>reporter</b> (Harris). Second, as long as I don't interfere, all these reports are in no way official. If I correct something, I admit the rest is right — yet everything is wrong the way it is reproduced. <b>Besides</b>, I <em>have reasons</em> not to convert these reports into legal <b>evidence</b> <em>against</em> me, which happens the moment I correct details.
<br>The way I shall express the matter next Tuesday is: that, quite apart from all 'international' and 'humane' phrases about <b>Justice for Ireland</b> — which are taken for granted on the <b>International Council</b> — it is in <em>the direct and absolute interests of the</em> <b>English working class to get rid of their present connexion with Ireland</b>. I am fully convinced of this, for reasons that, in part, I cannot tell the English workers themselves. For a long time I believed it would be possible to overthrow the Irish regime by <b>English working class ascendancy</b>. I always took this viewpoint in the <em>New-York Tribune.</em> Deeper study has now convinced me of the opposite. The English <b>working class</b> <em>will never accomplish</em> anything <b>before it has got rid of Ireland</b>. The lever must be applied in Ireland. This is why the Irish <b>question</b> is so important for the social movement in general.
<br>I have read a lot of <em>Davies</em> in extracts. The book itself I have only glanced through superficially in the Museum, so you would oblige me if you would copy out for me the passages relating to <b>common property</b>. You must get hold of Curran's '<em>Speeches' edited by Davies</em> (<em>London:</em> James Duffy, 22 Paternoster Row). I meant to give it to you when you were in London. It is now circulating among the English <b>members of the Central Council</b>, and God knows when I shall see it again. For the period 1779-1800 (Union) it is of decisive importance, not only because of Curran's '<em>Speeches'</em> (namely in court; I regard Curran as the <em>sole</em> great lawyer (people's advocate) of the 18th century, and the <em>noblest personality, while</em> Grattan was a parliamentary rogue), but because you find all <em>the</em> sources about the <b>United Irishmen</b><em>.</em> This period is of the greatest interest, <b>scientifically and dramatically</b>. First, the dirty infamies of the English in 1588-89 repeated (perhaps even intensified) in 1788-89. Second, class movement is easily shown in the Irish movement itself. Third, the infamous policy of Pitt. <em>Fourth, which</em> very much irks Messrs the English, the proof that Ireland came to grief because <b>in fact, from a revolutionary standpoint</b>, <em>the</em> Irish <em>were too</em> far advanced for the <b>English King and Church mob</b><em>,</em> while, on the other hand, English reaction in England (as in Cromwell's time) had its roots in the subjugation of Ireland. This period must be described in at least one chapter: a pillory for John Bull!
<br>Enclosed something French — and, as a contrast, Freiligrath-ish!
<br>I would be glad if you would send the money for the next quarter as soon as <em>possible.</em>
<br><em>Apropos</em>. Tussy has undertaken <b>a foolish work</b>, embroidering a sofa cushion for you for Christmas. I don't believe she will be finished, before the New Year. She allows neither Mama, nor Jennychen, nor Lenchen to sew a single stitch, so she has done <em>nothing else</em> for weeks. This is, however, a great secret, and you must naturally not give <em>the slightest</em> hint that you know about it. Tussy would eat me alive.
<br><b>Compliments to Mrs</b> Lizzy.
<br>Your<br>K. Moor
<br>Of the French stuff I am sending you, Gaulois — half Bonapartist, half opposition — is <b>stupid</b>. <em>Père Duchèsne will</em> astonish you by its impudence. And in such a <b>state of things</b> the bitch Eugénie dares to push herself forward ... ? She really wants to get hanged.
<br>Apropos. The translation of <em>Capital</em> <b>goes on</b>. Keller has now interrupted it, however. He wants to publish <em>18th Brumaire</em> first, believing this possible under the present circumstances and important for France.
<br>As for the current <em>Irish movement</em>, 3 important factors: 1. opposition to lawyers and <b>trading politicians</b> and <b>Blarney</b>; 2. opposition to the dictates of the priests who (<em>the higher ones</em>) are <b>traitors</b>, as in O'Connell's time, just as in 1798-1800; 3. the emergence of the <b>agricultural labouring class</b> against the <b>farming class on the last meetings</b>. (Similar phenomenon from 1795 to 1800.)
<br>The <em>Irishman</em> only made its way owing to the suppression of the <b>Fenian Press</b>. For a long time it stood <b>in opposition to</b> Fenianism. Luby, etc., <b>of the</b> <em>Irish People</em> were educated people who treated religion as a bagatelle. The government cast them into prison, and then came the Pigotts <em>et Co.</em> The <em>Irishman</em> will only continue to amount to anything until those people come out of prison. He knows this, though he is now squeezing <b>political capital</b> out of declarations on behalf of the '<b>felon convicts'.</b>

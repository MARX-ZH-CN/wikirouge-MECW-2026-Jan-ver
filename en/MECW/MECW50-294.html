<p>ENGELS TO KRYSTJU RAKOWSKI</p>
<p>IN NANCY</p>
<p>London, 13 April 1895<br>
41 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear citizen,</p>
<p>I am answering at once your request to drop a line to the Bulgarian comrades. Being overburdened with work, I answered in the negative the requests directed to me by the comrades both on the occasion of 18 March and on that of May Day. I also sent a negative reply last week<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> to the British Social-Democratic Federation. 44 You will see that if I were to comply with your request, I should have to comply with the requests of roughly forty groups from ten to twenty different countries, which is more than I can do. Please be so kind as to give the Bulgarian comrades my excuses and to tell them that I regret not being able to render them the service they are asking for and that in a different situation I should have been glad to write something specially for the Bulgarians as the youngest followers of socialism.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>F. Engels

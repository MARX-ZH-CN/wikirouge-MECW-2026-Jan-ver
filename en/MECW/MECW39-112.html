ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester, 22 October 1852]</p>
<p>Dear Marx,</p>
<p>If you want to count on receiving the articles for Dana punctually in future, you must take care not to send me Hungarian COLONELS, especially of a Thursday night. Yesterday the fellow<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> took up the whole of my evening and intends to come back today—he is pretty well-versed in a number of subjects, military included, and is the most interesting Hungarian I have met so far, but he is also a German-Austrian aristocrat.</p>
<p>So we are now recognised by the State, and even by the police, as 'intelligent' people, <i>teste</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Stieber. A fine business. The way that stupid Stieber tries to shuffle off responsibility for his own spy, Cherval, onto our chaps!<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Have you any idea why Kothes and Bermbach have been arrested?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> Those two, of all people—it's ominous! But we shall discipline Haupt.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> Weerth will find out where he is in South America and, on his arrival there, will unmask him. To that end we shall have to get hold of the <i>Kölnische Ztg</i>. or some other paper containing his statements. Could you not attend to this? Do everything you can; it would really be splendid to make the rascal feel the power of the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> as far away as Brazil.</p>
<p>More in a day or two, and also translations.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE</p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>London, 10 August 1882</p>
<p>Dear Sorge,</p>
<p>Herewith receipt from the <i>Egalité;</i> I haven't been able to obtain a better one for you from that remarkably businesslike office. Since Laura Lafargue moved to Paris, we over here no longer see or hear anything of that paper. The amount paid was 14/-.</p>
<p><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>The Labour Standard,</i> 1 July-5 August, goes off today in 2 parcels. It would be madness for you to take out a separate subscription to the thing. I shall simply send you my copy instead of throwing it into the waste-paper basket.</p>
<p>Marx still at Argenteuil,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> undergoing a sulphur cure in Enghien for chronic bronchitis. He still has to take considerable precautions against a recurrence of pleurisy. As for the rest, only the doctors know, or again they may not.</p>
<p>In great haste.

<li id="cite_note-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-3">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">By the 'Irish skirmishing' in the House of Commons Marx means the speeches of the Irish M.P.s who advocated Home Rule. The Irish national party—the <i>Irish Home Rule League</i> led by Isaac Butt—was founded in the early 1870s and, after the 1874 elections, was represented by 60 deputies in the House of Commons. The main point on its programme was Irish self-government to be secured strictly by parliamentary means. In their campaign, the League's deputies made a wide use of obstruction: introduction of numerous amend ments, and highly protracted speeches on all kind of subjects. This hampered the settlement of the questions under discussion and delayed debate on the next items on the agenda. An expert in these tactics was Charles Parnell, who turned them into an effective weapon in the struggle for a law on Home Rule.<br>At the General Council meeting of 4 January 1870 a letter was read from Isaac Butt who offered his assistance in establishing a union between the English and the Irish workers (see<i> The General Council of the First International.  1868-1870. Minutes,</i> Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1966, p. 197).</span>

ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 13 March 1870</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>MR J. Williams<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> has certainly had a bang-up and well-earned success. The dodge by the <i>Marseillaise</i> in printing the letter as an original<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> has got the whole English press into a fine pickle, and has finally forced <i>The Irishman</i> to admit its debt to the <i>Marseillaise</i> and the <i>Internationale.</i> The hushing-up is at an end, and MR Bruce—although in the lousy <i>Daily News</i> he again has O'Donovan Rossa described as 'ORDINARY CONVICT AND NOTHING ELSE'—will probably sing quite a different tune in answering the interpellations that are to come. Bravo Jenny! Lizzie is particularly grateful to you for the articles in the <i>Internationale</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> which pleased her enormously.</p>
<p>The two letters enclosed came to me from Solingen. I had addressed this Moll;<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> as 'thou', assuming him to be the brother of Jupp,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> and an old member of the League<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> thus the intimate tone. You will also note that we have also fallen prey to myth-formation. I know nothing about either the Schapper business, which looks very fuddled, or the business with my old man.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> My old man would have taken care not to let me pay out wages or anything like that; for this, I could not count well enough for his taste. Since I have to answer the fellows soon, you might let me know whether you have heard anything concerning Menke in the meantime.</p>
<p>The whole week I have been standing ready to have to go away because of my mother, but luckily things are getting better.</p>
<p>The following passage<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> suffices to characterise gentle old Gladstone's whole long LAND BILL as pure muck:</p>
<p>'THE LEASES IN QUESTION' (namely, as they are given today, now and then, in Ireland by the LANDLORDS to the TENANTS) 'ARE QUITE AS PRECARIOUS AS TENANCIES AT WILL. THEY HAVE NO EFFICACY WHATEVER IN REMOVING THE SENSE OF INSECURITY. A LEASE TO BE OF ANY AVAIL FOR THAT PURPOSE, SHOULD, SAVE IN THE PARTICULARS OF SUBDIVIDING AND SUBLETTING, BE FREE AND UNFETTERED—ABOVE ALL, IT SHOULD PUT NO OBSTACLE TO THE SALE OF THE TENANT'S INTEREST. BUT MODERN LEASES ARE THE REVERSE OF THIS—THEY ARE ENCUMBERED WITH CLAUSES AND COVENANTS PRESCRIBING THE MODE OF CULTIVATION AND THE DISPOSAL OF THE PRODUCE, NEGATIVELY AND AFFIRMATIVELY REGULATING THE ACTION OF THE TENANT AND ENTIRELY FORBIDDING THE ESSENTIAL POWER OF FREE ALIENATION. EVERY LINE IN THESE DOCUMENTS MAY WITHOUT MUCH EXAGGERATION BE SAID TO CONTAIN A LEGAL PITFALL FOR THE UNWARY AND THERE ARE FEW, INDEED, IF ANY, WHO CAN ESCAPE THE EFFECT OF THE LAST CLAUSE WITH WHICH THEY WIND UP, MAKING VOID THE LEASE IN CASE OF THE BREACH OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING COVENANTS. SUCH LEASES AFFORD NO SECURITY. THEY ARE QUITE AS PRECARIOUS AND MORE DANGEROUS THAN TENANCIES AT WILL.'</p>
<p>And who says this? MR Gallwey, AGENT (11) OF THE Kenmare ESTATE, AT THE Killarney BOARD OF GUARDIANS, 4 November, 1869. And the Kenmare ESTATE belongs to MARQUIS OF Landsdowne, whose general agent for all his Irish ESTATES is the honourable 'REALITY' Trench<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> One could not hope for a better authority. And these LEASES are the contracts BY WHICH, AFTER THE PASSING OF THIS BILL, EVERY IRISH TENANT IS TO BE HELD BOUND according to the noble Gladstone.</p>
<p>Have you had news from the Lafargues?</p>
<p>Best greetings to all of you.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

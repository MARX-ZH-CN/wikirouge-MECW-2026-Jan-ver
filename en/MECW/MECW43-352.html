JENNY MARX TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN</p>
<p>IN HANOVER</p>
<p>[London, 27 November 1869]</p>
<p>with the enjoyment of the portwine at the clubs.—On the following day, Monday, all the papers made a furious onslaught on those confounded 'foreigners', and cursed the day they had landed in England to demoralize sober John Bull by means of their bloodred flags, noisy choruses and other enormities....</p>
<p>It is tea-time—and I have promised to roast some chestnuts for Tussy, so thank your good stars or rather the chestnuts that this scrawl doesn't run on for ever.— (I am sure you have been thinking I was never going to stop.) With kindest remembrances from all at home.</p>
<p>Believe me dear 'Doctor'</p>
<p>Very faithfully yours</p>
<p>Jenny Marx</p>
<p>You seem surprised at my bestowing upon you your sonorous title. Believe me I do not grudge it to you. In 'our new society' there will be little need for priests of the body; they will go to the wall along with their brethren physicians of the soul—meanwhile I wish you joy—make the most of your dignities—while they last!

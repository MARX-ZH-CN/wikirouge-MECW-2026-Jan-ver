ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY</p>
<p>IN D E A L 5 9 4</p>
<p>London, 31 July 1886</p>
<p>Dear Kautsky,</p>
<p>I shall retain the POST OFFICE ORDER here as there would be no point in trying to cash it with the moron in Southampton Road. It will be kept at your disposal and, should you not return before, I shall leave it with Mrs Parker, alias Sarah, in an envelope addressed to you.</p>
<p>Instead, herewith a POST OFFICE ORDER for £ 4 in your name, <i>Karl</i> Kautsky, taken out by me Frederick Engels. If you could do with a few more pounds sterling, I will gladly let you have them.</p>
<p>Weather's improving — with you, too, I hope. So that there may be a chance of this letter's arriving today, I shall close. Kindest re- gards to your wife and yourself from Nim and</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F.E.

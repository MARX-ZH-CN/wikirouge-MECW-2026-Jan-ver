<br><em>Cologne,</em> November 5. <em>Letters and newspapers from Vienna failed to arrive</em>. The newspapers from <em>Breslau</em> which we have received, the <em>Allgemeine Oderzeitung</em>, the <em>Schlesische Zeitung</em> and the <em>Breslauer Zeitung</em>, contain, properly speaking, nothing.
<br>Several <em>Berlin</em> morning papers of November 3 carry the following news item, one newspaper having received it from <em>Hietzing</em>, the others from <em>Vienna</em>:

<blockquote>
<br>"<em>The city of Vienna is entirely occupied by imperial troops</em>."

</blockquote>
<br>The <em>Kölnische Zeitung</em> prints this report, which it received from Breslau [Kölnische Zeitung, Nov 5] and which "<em>is described as reliable</em>", and it confirms this report by a "telegram" from Berlin, which "in itself" is of course reliable.
<br>Let us leave aside the anonymous note from Breslau and proceed to the <em>telegram</em> printed in big letters in the <em>Kölnische Zeitung.</em> [Kölnische Zeitung, Nov 5]
<br>The telegram was dispatched from Vienna at noon on November 1.
<br>The letter to Dumont, if he received the news in writing, was sent at <em>8 a.m.</em> on November 3, with the Berlin mail.
<br>On the <em>evening</em> of November 3, this news was circulating merely as a rumour throughout Berlin, and the newspapers of November 4 published on the evening of November 3 <em>deny it.</em>
<br><em>Hence we have no news from Vienna</em>. Dumont, who reported the burning and capture of Vienna since October 6, could by way of exception have got hold of the right fact on one day in the month.

<p>TO MARX IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester,] Friday [28 February 1851]</p>
<p>Dear Marx,</p>
<p>Your letter of the day before yesterday didn't arrive till this morning. Had I already had all these details yesterday I would have written to our DEAR Harney in quite a different vein. But sooner or later he'll turn up and then I'll let him have a piece of my mind.</p>
<p>It would not, I believe, be a great deal of use to take serious legal proceedings over this business. Apart from Harney and Jones and the Chartists, the business would fizzle out in mutual recriminations and accusations. With the help of any advocate, the others would cause the most impudent questions to be put to Schramm and Pieper, e. g. whether Schramm had not stolen funds from Great Windmill Street,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> etc., etc., which, however vigorously they were parried, would be enough to ruin the whole effect. The defendants' witnesses would swear that Schramm had said such and such, they would recall certain of Schramm's scenes in Great Windmill Street and inflate them out of all proportion so as to depict Schramm as a DISTURBER OF PUBLIC MEETINGS, etc., and the MAGISTRATE, only too happy to see the demagogues dubbing each other rascals, would allow anything that might throw a compromising light on either party. Schramm, however, should use it as a threat.</p>
<p>Besides, he is taken FOR A CARE-THE-DEVIL, RECKLESS SORT OF CHARACTER, and they'll believe him capable of such excesses. He should give Landolphe a box on the ears and practise shooting; the chap's always getting involved in such affairs<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and, more than anyone else, he should know how to shoot.</p>
<p>The case would after all end up with nothing more than the rudest of snubs for both parties from the MAGISTRATE—especially as it would be heard up in Islington, where heaven knows what sort of old jackasses the MAGISTRATES are. And if Landolphe, <i>représentant du peuple</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> were to state that Schramm could only have come with the intention of making trouble, etc., don't you think that ultimately this would impress the public more than Schramm's and Pieper's statement? A great scandal could be made of the business, but then Schramm would risk having part of the scandal rebound on him in the form of insinuations.</p>
<p>And again, one sure consequence of such a scandal would be the introduction of a new Aliens Bill<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> to protect the honest reactionaries coming over from the Continent for the Exhibition.</p>
<p>But when given the cold shoulder by Landolphe, why the devil didn't Schramm go straight to Harney <i>pour le mettre en cause</i>?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Just time for the post. Adieu.</p>
<p>Your
F. E.

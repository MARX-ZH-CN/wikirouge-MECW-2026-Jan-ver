ENGELS TO ALBERT DELON</p>
<p>IN NIMES</p>
<p><i>[Note]</i></p>
<p>London, about 21 January 1894</p>
<p>Should first read the second volume and then refer back. To go by his letter to Diamandi, his German still isn't perfect but he's still working at it, in particular the terminology of political economy.

ENGELS TO HERMANN ENGELS</p>
<p>IN ENGELSKIRCHEN</p>
<p>Trondheim, 8 July 1890</p>
<p>We're about to sail for North Cape and I don't want to miss sending you a line from Trondheim. Have just eaten the best lobster I've had in my life and there was some very passable beer to go with it; have also seen a big waterfall. We sail at 9 o'clock, calling first at Tromsö and then at North Cape, after which we return via various Norwegian fjords and arrive back in the Thames on the 26th of this month. The weather has</p>
<p>been pretty good up till now, though yesterday was wet, but it's fine again today. I like the people pretty well; the girls wear a kerchief on their heads just as at home, and one feels one must have already run into them at some time or another in the Siebengebirge or the Eifel. But my pen is atrocious and it is only with difficulty that I have scrawled my way as far as this.</p>
<p>Much love to Emma and your children, Rudolf, Mathilde, Hedwig, etc.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

ENGELS TO JOHANN PHILIPP BECKER</p>
<p>IN GENEVA</p>
<p>London, 15 September 1879</p>
<p>Dear Old Man,</p>
<p>I trust you got my last letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>and the money order for 75 frs by post.</p>
<p>Sorge writes saying that he has written to you, too, about the necessity of renewing the power of attorney in respect of Lingenau's will, since Geib's death might otherwise put the lawyers of the contending party into the position of being able to declare the old power of attorney invalid and thus bring about new delays.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Marx, who is still at the seaside<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>and has apparently made a wonderful recovery, has just written telling me to ask you to send him the form for the power of attorney<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>so that he can attend to the same. Would you therefore be so good as to do this as soon as possible. If it involves you in any expense, write and tell me at once what it amounts to and I will send you the money. The sooner this is done the better. The power of attorney should, of course, be exactly the same as before, only omitting Geib's name, or else mentioning him as deceased.</p>
<p>The business of the German party organ in Zurich<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>is becoming more and more of a lark. The Zurich editorial committee which, under the general management of the Leipzigers, is to supervise and censor the paper, consists of Höchberg, Schramm and Bernstein. But now, in the <i>Jahrbuch für Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik,</i> published in Zurich by Höchberg, Schramm, Höchberg and Bernstein have printed an article 'Rückblick auf die sozialistische Bewegung in Deutschland'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>in which all three are revealed to be common or garden bourgeois and pacific philanthropists; they accuse the party of having been too exclusively a ''<i>workers' party',</i> and of having provoked the hatred of the bourgeoisie, and claim that leadership of the movement should be entrusted to 'educated' bourgeois of their own stamp. That's really going a bit too far.</p>
<p>Luckily Höchberg dropped in on me unexpectedly the day before yesterday, whereupon I gave him a piece of my mind. The unfortunate lad—not a bad chap, <i>au fond,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>but alarmingly naive—came down to earth with a bang when I pointed out to him that we couldn't think of lowering the proletarian flag which we had held aloft for nigh on 40 years, still less join in the general petty-bourgeois fraternisation fantasies against which we had been fighting, again for nigh on 40 years. In short, now he at last knows where he stands with us and also why, whatever the Leipzigers may say or do, we can't march shoulder to shoulder with people of his ilk.</p>
<p>We shall likewise supply Bebel with a quite categorical statement as to our standpoint vis-à-vis these allies of the German party,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>and then wait and see what they will do. If the party organ adopts the standpoint of the said bourgeois article, we shall publicly declare our opposition to it. However, they're unlikely to let things go so far.</p>
<p>Write soon, then. Warmest regards from Marx and</p>
<p>Your old friend,</p>
<p>F. Engels

After his death on 4 August 1877, they tried to have his estate passed on to the party, but Bismarck managed to prevent this by applying diplomatic pressure.</span>

The need for such a newspaper emerged after a ban on the entire party press, above all the <i>Vorwärts,</i> following the introduction of the Anti-Socialist Law in October 1878 (see Note 462). In July-September 1879, extensive correspondence on the political line of the new paper and its editors was maintained between August Bebel, Wilhelm Liebknecht, Louis Viereck (in Leipzig), Carl Hirsch (in Paris), Eduard Bernstein, Karl Höchberg, Carl August Schramm (in Zurich), and Marx and Engels (in London). The campaign Marx and Engels conducted for a sound political line of the party's future central printed organ is fully expounded in their Circular Letter to August Bebel, Wilhelm Liebknecht, Wilhelm Bracke and Others of 17-18 September 1879 (see this volume, pp. 394-408).</span>

<blockquote>
<p>This is Marx's synopsis of Imre Szabö's two-volume study, The State Policy of Modern Europe, from the Beginning of the Sixteenth Century to the Present Time, which was published anonymously in London in May-June 1857. Szabö's work, written in English, is a summary of inter-state relations in Europe from the Italian wars of the early 16th century to the Paris Congress of 1856. It reflects the influence of David Urquhart's views. Marx compiled his synopsis in the first half of June 1860 in connection with his work on Herr Vogt. He needed this historical investigation to expose the counter-revolutionary nature of Napoleon Ill's policy. In taking notes he concentrated on the events and fully ignored Szabö's interpretation of them. Some notes refer to events not mentioned in Szabö's work and are probably based on other sources. In the present edition these insertions and Marx's conclusions are set in large type. The names of persons and geographical names are reproduced in Marx's transcription, with their present spelling given in footnotes. Obvious mistakes have been silently corrected.</p>
<p>Marx drew on these notes above all in the chapter "Dâ-Dâ Vogt and His Studies" (see this volume, pp. 133-83).

Milan, claimed by Louis XII by the right of his grandmother, of the family of Visconti, conquered by Francis I in 1515 from the Sforzas; now claimed by Charles as a fief of the Empire.

<p>If Frederick raised Prussia to the rank formerly occupied by Sweden (since the peace of Westphalia<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-100" id="cite_ref-100">[100]</a></sup> ), he is prudent enough to profit by, but too weak to arrest, the progress of Muscovite ambition....

The distinctive character of this period the decline of France. In the first war the alliances of France with Frederick, twice thrown overboard by him, failed to wrest the German sceptre from dilapidated Austria.

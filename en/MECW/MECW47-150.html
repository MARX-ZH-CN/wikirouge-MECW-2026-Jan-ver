ENGELS TO FLORENCE KELLEY-WISCHNEWETZKY</p>
<p>IN HEIDELBERG</p>
<p>London, 4 February 1885 122 Regent's Park Road, N.W.</p>
<p>Dear Madam,</p>
<p>I hope you have received the letter I wrote to you about the time of the New Year.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>I now forward to you, <i>registered,</i> the ms. you sent to me, and only regret that press of work prevented my returning it earlier.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>I have looked it over carefully, and entered some corrections and suggestions in pencil, in order to show you how I should like it translated. Here and there you may find that my suggestions, taken together with the rest of the sentence, will not turn out to be correct English; in these cases I left it to you to set that right.</p>
<p>As for the technical terms, if you will be good enough to forward me from time to time a list of them with the pages on which they occur, I shall be glad to give you the English equivalents.</p>
<p>The German preface (as well as the English dedication)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>I would, in your place, leave out entirely. They contain nothing of interest <i>now.</i> The first part of the preface refers to a phase of intellectual development in Germany and elsewhere which is now almost forgotten, and the second part is in our days superfluous.</p>
<p>As to translations of my other writings you will understand as a matter of course that I cannot now take any positive engagements. There are people here who wish to translate one thing or another, and I have consented conditionally, that is to say if they find a publisher and really undertake the work.</p>
<p>The English preface I shall write<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>when things are a little more advanced.</p>
<p>In the meantime I remain</p>
<p>Yours very truly,</p>
<p>F. Engels

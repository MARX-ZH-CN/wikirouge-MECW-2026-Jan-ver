<blockquote>
<p>Engels wrote this Statement because he feared McEnnis would not be able to interpret his words correctly. He asked Sorge to have it published in one of the American socialist papers if the interview should appear in the press (see Engels' letter to Friedrich Sorge dated April 29, 1886, present edition, Vol. 47).

</blockquote>
<p>As a report of an interview with me by one of its correspondents has appeared in the Missouri Republican, I have the following remarks to make:</p>
<p>It is true that a Mr. McEnnis visited me as representative of this newspaper and put various questions to me, but promising on his honour not to send a line of it for print without first submitting it to me. Instead of doing that he never turned up again. I therefore declare herewith that I must refuse each and every responsibility for his publication, all the more so as I had the opportunity to satisfy myself that, because he lacked the necessary background knowledge, Mr. McEnnis, even with the best of wills, is hardly in a position to understand my statements correctly.</p>

MARX TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE
<br>IN HOBOKEN
<br>[London,] 27 May 1872
<br>My dear Sorge,
<br>I am flooded out with proofs, French proofs<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> (where I have to re-write an enormous amount that has been translated too literally) and German proofs,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> all of which have to be sent off.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> I can therefore only write you a few lines.
<br>I am sending you the German and French versions of the General Council declaration on the farce of the <b>Conseil fédéraliste universel etc.'.''<i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </i> Ditto <i>notre circulaire privée sur les Jurassiens.'</i></b><i><sup>6</sup> (More to follow,</i> as soon as we have the copies in quantity.) Eccarius handed in his resignation before his CASE was investigated.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> Provisionally, Le Moussu is responsible for <i>toute l'Amérique</i> (we also have contacts in South America now). Send everything to me since I see Le Moussu every day, and do not send anything to Hales, who keeps on doing the stupidest things simply out of a desire to seem important. There is an <i>enquête<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> </i> pending against him as well as Eccarius because of the American <i>affaire<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> .</i>
<br>Eccarius has become both a fool and a scoundrel. I shall write to you about it in greater detail in the course of this week.
<br>I shall insist on the 1,000 COPIES<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> tomorrow in the GENERAL COUNCIL.
<br>Yours,
<br>K. Marx

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The surviving manuscript copy of the letter does not bear the name of the addressee. However, its contents and Marx's correspondence on the subject indicate that it was addressed to the heads of the Lachâtre publishing house in Paris. On 13 February 1872 Marx received a reply from the manager Juste Vernouillet, who informed him about the despatch of copies of the agreement on the publication of the French translation of Volume I of<i> Capital.</i> The agreement was signed on 15 February by Marx on one side, and Maurice Lachâtre and Juste Vernouillet on the other. It stipulated that the French edition was to be published in 44 instalments, and sold five instalments at a time.<br>The French authorised edition of Volume I of<i> Capital</i> was published between 17 September 1872 and November 1875. The translation was done by Joseph Roy, who began in February 1872 and completed work in late 1873. The quality of the translation largely failed to satisfy Marx; besides, he was convinced that the original needed to be revised to adapt it to French readers.</br></span>

Eccarius opposed the expulsion of Section No. 12 and spoke out against Article 2 of Resolution III (see Note 471), accusing Friedrich Adolph Sorge and Section No. 1 (see Note 354), which he headed, of divisive activities. He refused to send the above-mentioned resolutions to the USA, stating in a number of letters (e.g. to petty-bourgeois activist John Elliott) that he strongly disapproved of them.<br>On 23 April 1872 the General Council meeting instructed Marx to prepare a detailed report on Eccarius' stand.<br>Part of this letter was published in English for the first time in: Karl Marx, <i>On the First International</i> Arranged and edited, with an introduction and new translations by Saul K.

<p><i>To Engels in Manchester</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 7 May 1868</b></p>
<p><b>Dear Fred</b>,</p>
<p><b>Best thanks</b> for your marginal notes. I have included them in the letter to Schweitzer as far as necessary. My letter is so coolly phrased that it will not be 'shown around'.</p>
<p>Now I would like to ask you for information on another subject. However, you can postpone this if it should interrupt the work for the <em>Fortnightly,</em> which is urgent.</p>
<p>The point is that I would like to link up with Volume I in the examples given in Volume II.</p>
<p>In order to use the data on your factory given on p. 186 completely sufficient to illustrate the rate of surplus value — for the <em>rate of profit;</em> the following would be necessary:</p>
<p>1. The missing data on the capital advanced for the <em>factory building</em> and the percentage of the <b>sinking fund</b> for this. Ditto <b>warehouse</b>. In both cases, the <b>rent</b> should be given, if paid. Also the office costs and costs of staff for the <b>warehouse</b>.</p>
<p>With regard to the <em>steam engine,</em> no data is given on the <em>percentage</em> at which the weekly wear and tear is calculated, and therefore the capital advanced for the steam engine is not visible either.</p>
<p>2. <em>Now the real question.</em> How do you calculate the <em>turnover</em> of the <em>circulating part of capital</em> (i.e. raw material, auxiliary materials, wages)? How great then is the <em>circulating</em> capital <em>advanced</em>? I would like to receive this answered <em>in detail</em> even illustrated, particularly the turnover calculation of the circulating capital advanced.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I shall send you the crazy Urquhart for your amusement.</p>
<p><em>Salut.</em></p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.

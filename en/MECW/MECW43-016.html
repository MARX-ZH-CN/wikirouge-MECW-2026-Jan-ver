<p><i>To Engels in Manchester</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 7 May 1868</b></p>
<p><b>Dear Fred</b>,</p>
<p><b>Best thanks</b> for your marginal notes. I have included them in the letter to Schweitzer as far as necessary. My letter is so coolly phrased that it will not be 'shown around'.</p>
<p>Now I would like to ask you for information on another subject. However, you can postpone this if it should interrupt the work for the <i>Fortnightly,</i> which is urgent.</p>
<p>The point is that I would like to link up with Volume I in the examples given in Volume II.</p>
<p>In order to use the data on your factory given on p. 186 completely sufficient to illustrate the rate of surplus value — for the <i>rate of profit;</i> the following would be necessary:</p>
<p>1. The missing data on the capital advanced for the <i>factory building</i> and the percentage of the <b>sinking fund</b> for this. Ditto <b>warehouse</b>. In both cases, the <b>rent</b> should be given, if paid. Also the office costs and costs of staff for the <b>warehouse</b>.</p>
<p>With regard to the <i>steam engine,</i> no data is given on the <i>percentage</i> at which the weekly wear and tear is calculated, and therefore the capital advanced for the steam engine is not visible either.</p>
<p>2. <i>Now the real question.</i> How do you calculate the <i>turnover</i> of the <i>circulating part of capital</i> (i.e. raw material, auxiliary materials, wages)? How great then is the <i>circulating</i> capital <i>advanced</i>? I would like to receive this answered <i>in detail</i> even illustrated, particularly the turnover calculation of the circulating capital advanced.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I shall send you the crazy Urquhart for your amusement.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.
</p>

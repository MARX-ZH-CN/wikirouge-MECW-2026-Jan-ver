ENGELS TO JENNY LONGUET</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Ramsgate, 2 August 1874<br>11 Abbot's Hill</p>
<p>My dear Jenny,</p>
<p>I was sorry I did not see you again before my return and now write to you to remind you of your promise to come over here for a short time.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>We are staying here till Tuesday fortnight and can accommodate you any day. After all you have gone through both bodily and mentally during these last weeks, it is absolutely necessary for you to have some change of air and change of scene, and I am sure you require the seaside quite as much as Mohr and Tussy require Karlsbad. Do take me for your doctor for the nonce and let me prescribe a short term of sea air for you. The sooner you come the better it will be for you. Mrs E.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>was quite vexed I had not brought you with me there and then. She and Pumps send their loves to you.</p>
<p>Please remember me to Longuet and believe me yours ever faithfully and affectionately</p>
<p>F. Engels

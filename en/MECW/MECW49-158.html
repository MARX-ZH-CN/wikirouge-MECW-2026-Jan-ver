ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY</p>
<p>IN STUTTGART</p>
<p>London, 3 December 1891</p>
<p>Dear Kautsky,</p>
<p>Your letter of 30 October has long been awaiting an answer; the blame for this must be placed upon Volume III<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>which I am once again sweating away at. I have just got to the most difficult part, i. e. the last chapters (six to eight or thereabouts) on money capital, banks, credit, etc., and, once having started, I shall have to keep at it without a break and work through the relevant literature again, in short make myself completely <i>au fait,</i> if only so that I may — as is probable — eventually leave most of it as it stands, yet at the same time feel quite sure that I have committed no blunders either in the positive or the negative sense.</p>
<p>Very many thanks for the reports on Erfurt<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>; they were of value to me in many respects, the discussions of the programme committee being of particular interest. You describe the Executive's draft as <i>his,</i> Liebknecht's. Bebel sent me all the material relative to the genesis of this draft<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>from which it is evident that at each stage a fair portion of Liebknecht's initial work had been dropped and replaced with Bebel's propositions until in the end little or nothing remained. What did remain, however, was a lack of coherence, of rigour in the coordination of individual propositions, both being attributable to the consideration paid to Liebknecht's work. That was what gave your draft<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>the advantage, as everyone was bound to acknowledge at first glance, and it was that, too, along with Bebel's public admission of the fact, which immediately convinced the others.</p>
<p>The recent investigations, which have rendered obsolete Marx's chapter on the historical trend of capitalist accumulation,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>are in any case the work of Geiser who is of course regarded in Breslau<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>as a genuine scientific authority. However it is also possible that in his embarrassment Liebknecht said (for he was obviously unaware that these propositions had been taken from <i>Capital</i>) the first 'bit of nonsense', as he would put it, that came into his head.</p>
<p>At any rate the theoretical part of the programme is now perfectly presentable; the main thing is that it should contain nothing that is theoretically controversial and in the main this aim has been achieved. The practical demands contain all kinds of snags; many of them seem philistine — if applied to conditions today — but now that we occupy a position of power we can reply quite rightly that they will certainly not be implemented until we come to the helm and that they will then assume quite a different character. As, for instance, free legal advice. A six hours' working day up till the age of 18 obviously ought to have gone in — as also the banning of night work for women and of any sort of work at the very least one month before and 6 weeks after a confinement.</p>
<p>I'm sorry for Liebknecht. For he had to sing the praises of the new programme although it was perfectly plain to everyone that he had had no part in it whatever. But he took on the job of his own accord, so what can one do about it?</p>
<p>What you say about Tölcke's speech is new to me and most interesting.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>Ede's work<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>goaded the Old Lassalleans into a state of great activity at a time when Marx's letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>had already roused them from the complacency induced by the obligatory deification of Lassalle. Even Jacob Audorf, the discoverer of the path of boldness along which we were led by Baron Izzy<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>(as Marx used to call the chap), has been letting forth indignant battle cries amidst the Sunday chit-chat of the <i>Hamburger Echo.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup>But they no longer count for anything. Incidentally, Ede got much more upset than he needed to over Bebel's, etc., criticism. Bebel was most reasonable, merely demanding that, so far as the <i>form</i> was concerned, his procedure should be such as not, at the very outset, to frighten off those readers with a tradition of Lassalle worship or to give the Old Lassalleans any justified grounds for complaint. To this was added the unfortunate circumstance that Ede had inserted a note that was admittedly quite uncalled for (because he turned it into a piece of tittle-tattle by using 'probably') about syphilis<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup>and the worthy censors in Berlin <i>did not spot this note</i> until it was too late. The fact that <i>they</i> had made a hash of the business caused them, of course, to fly momentarily into a mighty Achillean rage whereupon Ede, of course, had to atone, not only for <i>his own</i> lapse but even more for <i>theirs,</i> by receiving a number of indignant letters. Naturally I have backed him up as best as I could throughout the whole affair.</p>
<p>The opposition press <i>lives</i> on the antithesis of the <i>national</i> Lassalle and the <i>unpatriotic</i> Social-Democrats. So they'll take care not to lay their hands on a book in which the legend of the nationalist Lassalle is so thoroughly demolished.</p>
<p>Ede's work is really very good and gave me great pleasure; it will elicit the major response it deserves in Germany — in the course of time — and, on completion of this edition, ought to be printed separately and/or expanded by Ede and divested of its special purpose. By then things will have progressed far enough for this to be perfectly feasible. In this country, too, it will have a good effect, for over here your socialistically inclined bourgeois is also seeking to oppose Marx by making a legend out of Lassalle.</p>
<p>I shall take another look at the letter Labriola wrote to Tussy. My impression is that it would be better <i>not</i> to print it. Labriola is very dissatisfied with the way things are going in Italy and I'm not sure that it may not have something to do with his disappointment over the fact that his joining the movement did not immediately revive and revolutionise it. So far as I recall, the letter was of the kind that might have elicited dozens of replies. Some strange things are certainly going on there.</p>
<p>You will regret Lafargue's translation from Pélagie to the Chamber. It will deprive you of many a nice article.</p>

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">In his letter to Engels of 8 September 1890 Karl Kautsky said he intended, after the Halle party congress (see Note 12), to publish in <i>Neue Zeit</i> a series of articles criticising the party programme adopted at the Gotha congress in 1875. The prospective authors included Engels, Bebel, Auer, Bernstein and others.</span>
</li>
<li id="cite_note-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-3">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">As can be seen from the letters of August Bebel and Richard Fischer of 18 June 1891, the following items relating to the drafting of a new programme of German Social-Democracy to be adopted by the party congress in Erfurt had been sent to Engels for consideration: the draft programme compiled by Wilhelm Liebknecht; a copy of it with amendments in Bebel's hand, Liebknecht's second draft, taking into account Bebel's amendments; and the draft proper as endorsed by the party Executive. At the Executive's decision, copies of the draft were sent to Engels and other working-class and socialist leaders and also to the Social-Democratic Reichstag deputies.<br>Engels gave a detailed analysis of the document in 'A Critique of the Draft Social-Democratic Programme of 1891' (see present edition, Vol. 27, pp. 217-34). For a long time the copy of the draft sent to Engels had been considered lost. It was first published in the journal <i>Beiträge zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung</i> (Berlin), 1968, Sonderheft, pp. 173-74. In the present edition it will be found in Volume 27, Note 184. The extent to which Engels' criticisms on the version of the draft programme sent him were taken into account can be seen from the draft programme published by the party Executive in <i>Vorwärts</i> on 4 July 1891, soon after the receipt of Engels' comments (see present edition, Vol. 27, Note 184), and from Bebel's letter of 12 July 1891. Another draft programme, written by Karl Kautsky, was put forward by the editorial board of <i>Neue Zeit.</i> These documents show that account had been taken of Engels' criticism pertaining to the general theoretical propositions and to the section stating the economic demands. No changes of substance were made in the political demands section. The draft contained no mention of the conquest of political power by the proletariat, of the democratic republic, of remodelling Germany's political system or of the need to combat the survivals of feudalism and absolutism.</span>

The first three articles, dealing with the theoretical section of the programme, were by Kautsky, the fourth, analysing the practical demands, was by Bernstein. The various criticisms were summarised in the form of a new draft programme, given in the concluding part of the fourth article (see also Note 322).</span>

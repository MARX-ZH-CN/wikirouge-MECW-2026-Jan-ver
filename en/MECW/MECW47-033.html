ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>London, 19 September 1883</p>
<p>My dear Laura,</p>
<p>At last returned from Eastbourne,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> where correspondence was rendered difficult and almost impossible by circumstances. When proof-sheets<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> arrived — 3 times a week — my company left me to my work, but on the silent understanding that I was not to exact any- thing further — and how indeed could I have asked for peace and quietness in the one sitting room allotted to us all, especially when the thirst for Pilsener drove them in at certain times of the day?</p>
<p>I was besides busy with Sam Moore's specimen translation<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> the greater part of which is very good and lively; the beginning — rather a difficult chapter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> — wanted a deal of 'look after', on account of his not having been exact enough in rendering the terminology, but that could be easily settled. I am certain from what I have seen that he will do the job well.</p>
<p>I also began revising Deville's pamphlet,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> it requires more work, especially in the beginning where great precision is necessary, but is wanting here and there. However I shall have no difficulty in setting that right, only it will take a week or a fortnight. I shall set to work ser- iously to-morrow. As far as I have gone, I am much pleased with his work, he has well understood everything (except small details) and it is written in a more lively style than I thought it would be.</p>
<p>As soon as that is shaken off I begin with the 2nd volume [of] <i>Kapital.</i></p>
<p>I hope you received my post-card with the information you had asked me for. It was sent the day after I received your letter.</p>
<p>We came back last Friday, Pumps and Percy stayed here over Sunday, their house not being in order. Since then we had a thunder- storm and fearful rain in parts of London which flooded their back drawing-room. Otherwise they are flourishing. The little boy is get- ting on wonderfully well, he was five months yesterday, and is ex- tremely intelligent for his age.</p>
<p>Nim declares she must reduce her allowance of beer. She thinks she is getting too fat with it.</p>
<p>This morning Lopatin walks in, his adventures have ripened him considerably. He will be here again directly and have dinner with us. He says he saw Paul lately and found him well and content, all things considered.</p>
<p>Tussy I have not seen yet, I believe she is not in town, I wrote her a line but she did not turn up on Sunday. As soon as Nim can get off she'll call on her.</p>
<p>Of my little pamphlet <i>Entwicklung etc.</i> two editions are already sold, the third is in the press.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> That shows anyhow that it is not too difficult for the mass of the working people in Germany.</p>
<p>When this letter arrives, Paul will have 'done' 2/3rds of his time — I hope he will keep his pluck up for the two last and most trying months.</p>
<p>Of the 3rd edition [of] <i>Kapital</i> I have read proofs up to page 448, so if they go on at this rate, the whole will be completed by Decem- ber. I am sorry Mohr has not lived to see how well this time the thing is done: no delay, no trouble with the printers, no trifling complaint but is at once set right, and excellent proofs with very few mistakes. Leipzig seems at last, and at least in this one respect of printing, to become <b>ein klein Paris</b><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> High time it was.</p>
<p>So now I conclude this budget of miscellaneous news in order to set a few little jobs right before Lopatin drops in again. Kind regards for Paul and a hearty kiss for yourself from</p>
<p>Yours affectionately,</p>
<p><i>Le général pour rire</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> </p>

On 2 August 1882 he met Marx in Paris where the latter looked through part of his manuscript. On 10 August 1883 Deville wrote to Engels that Paul Lafargue had told him he (Engels) was willing to read the rest of the work. He sent Engels the manuscript with the request that he make the necessary corrections. Deville's book was published that year under the title<i> Le Capital de Karl Marx. Résumé et accompagné d'un aperçu sur le socialisme scientifique.</i> In the Preface the author wrote that he had done the work 'at the courteous request and benevolent encouragement of Karl Marx'. Deville sent Engels a copy with his own dedication. For Engels' assessment of the book see this volume, pp. 61, 76-77.</span>

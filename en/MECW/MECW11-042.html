<br>Note from MECW :

<blockquote>
<br>This list was drawn up by Engels.— Ed.
<br>This list of documents shows the efforts made by Marx and Engels to help the accused Communists in Cologne and their defence counsel to prove how unfounded were the charges fabricated against them by means of perjury, juggling with facts and forged material. The documents enumerated in the list were to provide the defence with material exposing the provocative actions of the police and judicial authorities. As addressees the list often mentions businessmen and trading houses which Marx and Engels used for safe dispatch of the documents to the defence counsels Schneider II, Esser I and Hontheim. Most of these conspiratorial addresses were supplied by Engels, making use of his commercial ties.
<br>The calendar for July-October 1852 (in Engels' handwriting) at the end of the manuscript is not reproduced in this volume.

1) Marx's letter of October 26, 1852 to the lawyer Schneider II which, in view of its importance, was sent to Cologne in four copies through different hands, including Weerth from Manchester (see Marx's letter to Engels of October 26, 1852); two other copies, besides the third spoken of in this point, are mentioned by Engels in the list under No. 1 and No. 8; the letter has not been found.

2) A letter from Hermann Becker, one of the main accused at the trial, to Marx dated January 27, 1851 (see this volume, p. 452; it is also mentioned in point 8 of this document), and letters from Roland Daniels to Marx, written between February and May 1851, concerning his book Mikrokosmos. Entwurf einer physiologischen Anthropologie. The letters in question were written by Becker and Daniels prior to their arrest.

3) Cherval's statement, printed in The People's Paper after his escape to England arranged by the French police (see this volume, p. 418).

4) A letter from Stieber to Marx of December 26, 1848, quoted by Marx in his Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne (see this volume, pp. 435-36); this letter is also mentioned in point 8.</span>

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 14 October 1867</p>
<p>Dear FRED,</p>
<p>You will see from the enclosed letter No. II from Juch that, although Achilles<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>is dead, Beta is still alive. Juch's letter was probably provoked by the fact that Beta speaks well of Kinkel but not Freiligrath, and that Beta's article also contains some malicious remarks directed at Juch. When Freiligrath and Juch form an alliance, they are incapable of producing even a bad joke. For which reason I am to be incited to action, being 'thoroughly venomous', as Beta calls me in that vile scrawl of an article he wrote: 'Die Deutschen in London', which begins with the Norman Conquest and ends with that oily Jew Bender as the sole epitome of mankind in England.</p>
<p>This is about the 6th time now that Mr Juch has offered me his stale columns<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>for the purpose of 'self-glorification', for him a well proven tactic which he has used, successfully of course, with Blind, Kinkel, Freiligrath, and Heintzmann. I wrote him a few lines only.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>And <i>not</i> to Mr. Freiligrath's <i>liking</i> either. I told him <i>privatim</i> of what happened at Beta's <i>How do you do?</i> editorial office when I went there in the company of Ziegenhainer, Freiligrath, and our W. Wolff.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>So as to give him one bad joke for his trouble, I told him that I would not allow Kinkel the credit for being more than the a and o&gt; to this Beta.</p>
<p>Typical of Juch: he sends me Payne's people's calendar<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>which contains the <i>corpus delicti</i> (like all such abominations in Germany, <i>Gartenlaube,</i> etc., this calendar has 250,000 subscribers), along with the inevitable invoice for lid., which I immediately enclosed with my reply. Though admittedly he was once more on the threshold of the BANKRUPTCY COURT and has with great difficulty SETTLED with his creditors for monthly payments of 2s. 6d. in the £.</p>
<p>How shall I answer the enclosed from Nahmer?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Has Borkheim sent you the <i>Courrier français</i> with the translation of my preface<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>? I am asking because POOR Lafargue is on tenterhooks for 'your verdict'—every day. The Belgian <i>Liberté</i> arrived today, having ditto printed the <i>préface,</i> with very 'fulsome' PREAMBLE,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>in which it reminds the Belgian government of my EXPULSION.</p>
<p>I had already replied to Liebknecht, but had to write to him again today because I only today received the 2 ACTS relating to the TRADE UNIONS COMMISSION.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>Your tips attached to my letter.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i> COMPLIMENTS TO MRS BURNS.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Moro

To substantiate this proposal Liebknecht wanted to acquaint himself with the powers of similar commissions in England and asked Marx to send him the relevant legislative acts.
Marx sent him the following acts: An Act for Facilitating in Certain Cases the Proceedings of the Commissioners appointed to make Inquiry respecting Trades Unions and other Associations of Employers or Workmen which had been passed by the British Parliament on 5 April 1867, and An Act to Extend the 'Trades Union Commission Act, 1867' which had been passed on 12 August 1867.</span>

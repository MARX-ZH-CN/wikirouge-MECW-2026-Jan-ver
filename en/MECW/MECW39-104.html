<br><i>To Adolf Cluss in Washington</i>

<br>Dear Cluss,
<br>Your letter of 16 September arrived very late today. I am therefore sending only a few lines in reply, since you ask for an answer by return. Next Friday a rather more substantial report will be going off to you. My information about the Brüningk woman (she's not a spy but corresponds with her aunt, the Princess Lieven, in Paris, who is notoriously one) came from Bangya. The latter, however, has <em>very important reasons</em> for not being named. If he were, he would forfeit many 'sources of information' which, being important to us, must be preserved.
<br>You can write and tell Schnauffer that he merely has to answer that no further authorities need be cited since his (Brüningk's) two <em>friends, Kinkel and Willich</em>, have themselves been spreading it about in London that Mrs von Brüningk has suspect political connections.
<br>That <em>Willich</em> has been saying things of this kind is so well known that Schimmelpfennig has taken him to task about it. If necessary, witnesses can be cited to support this.
<br><em>Kinkel</em> voiced this suspicion outright, e.g. to his friend Kamm, the brushmaker (from Bonn), when the latter passed through here on his way to America. Kamm helped to spread it further.
<br>(Willich, of course, did not discover that the woman was suspect until after she had dropped him.)
<br>Your<br>K. M.

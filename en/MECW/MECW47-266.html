ENGELS TO JOHANN PHILIPP BECKER</p>
<p>IN GENEVA</p>
<p>London, 9 July 1886</p>
<p>Dear Old Comrade,</p>
<p>I put off answering your letter for a few days as I wanted to wait and see whether I could find some way of entering into your Paris scheme.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I couldn't, alas, if only because</p>
<p>1) I am tied down in England through having to attend to the proof-correction and publication of the English translation of <i>Capital</i> which is now printing; nor could I leave this to anyone else even if I were not bound by my contract.</p>
<p>2) For the past 3 months, however, I have again become an invalid, 200 or 300 paces being the most I can manage, and am dependent on all sorts of medical persons; the business is just <i>gênant,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> no more, but at any moment complications might set in if I didn't take things easy, so there can be no question of a long journey. And even if, as I hope, I am more mobile this autumn, I really must do my utmost this time to rid myself for good of this old trouble by which I have been crippled off and on during the past three years, and that means doing nothing that might bring about a relapse. I simply must get to the stage of being able to walk for 2 or 3 hours on end, otherwise I shall be done for and unable to do any sustained work. I had thought that, during the past fortnight, I might get to the stage of being able to register a positive improvement, but it's taking longer than I imagined.</p>
<p>Well, with luck we might be able to make some other arrangement. For once in Paris, you might just as well cross the Channel and spend a little while here. I would gladly bear the cost, and your stay over here wouldn't cost you a penny. In August I am being sent to the seaside to recuperate and in September I shall have visitors from the provinces, from Germany and most likely also the Lafargues from Paris and, since I only have one spare room, putting up all these people will be none too easy. But in October it will all be over and I shall be able to let you have the room any time you like, and should be delighted to see you here. Then we could also talk things over and exchange all our news at greater leisure than in Paris where, after all, one is never on one's own.</p>
<p>So make up your mind. By October, too, my <i>urgent</i> work will be so far advanced that I shall be able to shelve everything else; I also hope to have made sufficient progress to tipple again. If, by the by, you would rather come here in September, let me know; either way, I'm sure it can be managed. There are all sorts of things that still remain to be discussed and, above all, you have so much information — known, as you say, to no one else — about the historical origins of the movement to pass on to me, that it would be a crying shame if we didn't do our utmost to foregather once again and get all this off our chests.</p>
<p>I haven't yet had a chance to put Marx's papers in order, a job that would take me at least a month. Perhaps I shall get round to it in the autumn, for done it has got to be, and done before the days grow too short.</p>
<p>I am taking out another five pound money order for you which I hope will reach you soon after, or at the same time as, this letter.</p>
<p>So do make up your mind. I look forward immensely to seeing you again and discussing things with you face to face. If I were as steady on my pins as you, I should come to Geneva — but as it is! Well, I expect you to do it in my stead, and come over here.</p>
<p>Your old friend</p>
<p>F. Engels

Dear Becker,</p>
<p>I know that you felt greatly offended by a letter I wrote to Bürgers.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>However, in this letter, which was written under very trying circumstances, I had no intention of offending you any more than my other friends in Cologne. I believe that this explanation will satisfy you and that, without harking back to the past, I can proceed straight to the proposals I have to make to you.</p>
<p>1. You know how wretchedly Mr Schuberth has managed our <i>Revue</i>. I believe that in a few days' time he will have brought out the last two issues. I wish to continue the enterprise as a quarterly (from February onwards), 20 sheets every quarter. The increased size would allow the inclusion of more varied material. Can you undertake publication, and on what terms?</p>
<p>2. A friend of mine<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>has translated my anti-Proudhon piece<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>from the French into German and has written his own introduction to it. I would put the same question to you as above.</p>
<p>3. I have devised a scheme by which socialist literature consisting of a series of small pamphlets could be launched on the public in successive publications. A start could not be made until March. Should you be willing to undertake something of this kind, the things would be got ready in the meantime. I believe that, after its recent cheering experience of <i>haute politique</i>, the German public will by and by find itself obliged to turn its urgent attention to the real content of present-day struggles. I beg you to reply soon.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. Marx

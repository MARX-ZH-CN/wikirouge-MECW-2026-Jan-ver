MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 18 December 1860</p>
<p>Dear Frederick,</p>
<p>My wife is now much better. Allen thinks that the children — running two households is not only very inconvenient, but also expensive—will be able to come back on Sunday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>or Monday. I myself shall then resume my contributions to the <i>Tribune,</i> which has had only 2 articles<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>in nearly 5 weeks. Let me have another one by Saturday if you can.</p>
<p>For the past two days, I have been confined to bed and taking medicine, but Allen says it is nothing of any consequence and I should be fit again in 3 or 4 days. Apparently, it's the result of the</p>
<p>EXCITEMENT, etC.</p>
<p>As regards your view of Szemere, I would inform you, <i>strictly on the quiet,</i> that I am entirely of the same mind. The really funny part is that I had proposed to him, ironically, that they should keep the Habsburgs for themselves, that Pest would be the final place of refuge for the same, etc.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

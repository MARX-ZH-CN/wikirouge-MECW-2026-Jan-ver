ENGELS TO FILIPPO TURATI</p>
<p>IN MILAN</p>
<p>London, 31 July 1894<br>
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>My dear Turati,</p>
<p>A certain Mr Pasquali has arrived here a couple of days ago saying that he has been banished for the Sicily business and was obliged to leave Paris, where he was a correspondent for <i>Punto Nero</i> (and in possession of authorisation from the editorial board), but had been threatened by the police.</p>
<p>In Turin he was a preacher or missionary of the English sect of Baptists, and showed me the letter from his ecclesiastical superior in which he was removed from this post because of his socialism.</p>
<p>He will need assistance since, even if he seriously looked for work, he does not speak a word of English.</p>
<p>As in other countries we have had some curious experiences with ex-ecclesiastics of Christian, Jewish and other religions. I and my other friends here would be obliged to you if you could give us some information on this man, who claims to know you.</p>
<p>Has he indeed been banished from Italy? Has he indeed been obliged to leave Paris to escape pursuit? Has he indeed played a role, and if so, what, in the events in Sicily and in the socialist movement in Italy in general?</p>
<p>Greetings to you and Mme Anna from Louise Kautsky-Freyberger and myself,</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F. Engels

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Bridlington Quay, Yorkshire,
3 September 1880
7 Burlington Place</p>
<p>My dear Lafargue,</p>
<p>Why Geneva? The seat of the Swiss Federal Government is Berne and, besides, any other Swiss town would do as well as Geneva. Unless you have specific objections, of which I may be unaware, the stuff might just as well be deposited in Zurich where someone could undoubtedly be found to take charge of the business. If it suits you, send the things to me here and we will readdress them to someone who will immediately attend to them.</p>
<p>May the soil rest lightly
On the egalitarian <i>Egalité.</i></p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>F. Engels

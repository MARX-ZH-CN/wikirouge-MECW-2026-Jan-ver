ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 3 August 1859</p>
<p>7 Southgate</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Herewith the beginning of the article about your book.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Take a good look at it and, if you don't like it <i>in toto,</i> tear it up and let me have your opinion. Through lack of practice I have grown so unused to this sort of writing that your wife will be greatly tickled by my awkwardness. If you can knock it into shape, do so. A few convincing examples of the materialistic viewpoint would not come amiss, in place of my indifferent reference to the February revolution<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>As soon as I've done with this thing, I shall set to work on 'Infantry', which will, however, demand a good deal of time and trouble, despite Rüstow, who must, of course, be treated with some reserve.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Can you shed any further light on the particulars contained in Crawshay's letter in <i>The Free Press</i> of 27 July regarding the Russian document?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> Surely the 'German' isn't Mr Bücher? And in which German paper is the thing supposed to have appeared?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>When you saw Blind, did you speak to him about the Vogt affair?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> <i>N'y avait-il rien à faire?</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The gentle Heinrich<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> is acquitting himself well in his new role. Gloomy as ever, but all the lazier for that, redeeming the world by his courageous and intelligent GRUMBLING.</p>
<p>Lupus has had another adventure, this time with a parson who swapped travelling bags with him. The deadly earnestness of the affair was, however, alleviated by the fact that the bag that had been left behind contained the said parson's MAIDEN SERMON which he was due to rattle off the following day. This lent the thing certain humorous <i>extérieurs,</i> otherwise Lupus was again on the point of exclaiming: * 'There are so many rogues in this country, and not of the working class, but of the middle class.' *</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

<li id="cite_note-6"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-6">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">About the middle of July 1859 Marx talked with Blind, Liebknecht and Hollinger, the owner of the print-shop in which<i> Das Volk</i> was printed, about the anti-Vogt anonymous pamphlet<i> Zur Warnung (A Warning)</i> which had been reprinted in<i> Das Volk,</i> No. 7, 18 June and the Augsburg<i> Allgemeine Zeitung, </i> No. 173, 22 June. The pamphlet exposed Vogt as a bribed Bonapartist agent. During the conversation, Marx gave it as his opinion that the pamphlet had been written by Blind as it contained facts which the latter had related to him at a public meeting on 9 May 1859 (see Note 420); Marx also pointed out that the proofs of the pamphlet, discovered by Liebknecht in Hollinger's print-shop in mid-June and sent by him to the<i> Allgemeine Zeitung</i> contained corrections in Blind's handwriting. However, Blind, unwilling openly to attack Vogt, denied his authorship. His attitude was later condemned by Marx in his polemi cal work<i> Herr Vogt</i> (present edition, Vol. 17, pp. 122-32).—479, 486, 498. 503, 539</span>

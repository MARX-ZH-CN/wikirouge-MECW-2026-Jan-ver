<p>I may be mistaken, but it seems to me that this year May Day will not play the dominant role in the life of the international proletariat that it has done these last three years.</p>
<p>Of the major European countries it is only Austria that seems to wish to keep the demonstration in the foreground. Indeed, there the workers have no other scope for action.</p>
<p>Certainly in France, very likely in Germany and possibly in England, this year will see the importance of May Day eclipsed by general elections, in which the proletariat will be called upon to conquer new positions and, without any doubt, it will do so. <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>If, then, May Day should suffer a little in some respects from the approach of the elections, there will be no need to be perturbed. We will not have given way. On the contrary.</p>
<p>Demonstrations are excellent things, but only so long as we have nothing better to do.</p>
<p>Let the bourgeoisie beware of rejoicing too soon!</p>
<p>See you at the polls and after that at the Palais-Bourbon! <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> </p>

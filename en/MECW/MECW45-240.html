MARX TO AN UNKNOWN CORRESPONDENT
<br>London, 4 November 1878
<br>Dear Friend,
<br>You would greatly oblige me by seeing if you could safely convey the enclosed letter to <i>Mrs Liebknecht's</i> address, <i>11 Braustrasse, Leipzig.</i> It concerns the 'stomach problem' for Liebknecht's family, but I don't trust the German post.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>Yours very sincerely,
<br>Karl Marx

<div class="mw-references-wrap"><ol class="references">
<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">This letter was occasioned by Marx's and Engels' attempts to get Liebknecht a job on the London <i>Whitehall Review,</i> since the <i>Vorwärts,</i> where he had been a member of staff, had been banned with the introduction of the Anti-Socialist Law in Germany on 21 October 1878. On 4 November, Marx sent a letter through a third party to Natalie Liebknecht, which she received on 14 November. Its contents are not known, but Liebknecht must have read it, since on 18 November he thanked Engels and Marx for their efforts to find him a job (see also this volume, p. 352).</span>

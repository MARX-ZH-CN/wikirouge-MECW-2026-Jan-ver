ENGELS TO PYOTR LAVROV</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Postcard]</p>
<p>[London,] 18 February 1882 122 Regent's Park Road</p>
<p>My dear Mr Lavrov,</p>
<p>I am exceedingly sorry to have missed you this afternoon — however if, as I hope, this note reaches you tonight, I would ask you to be so good as to come to my house tomorrow, Sunday evening, at about 7 or 8 o'clock. You will find some friends there and we shall all be very pleased to see you.</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>F. Engels</p>
<p>[On the side reserved for the address]</p>
<p>P. Lavrov, Esq. 13 Alfred Place Tottenham Court Road W. C.

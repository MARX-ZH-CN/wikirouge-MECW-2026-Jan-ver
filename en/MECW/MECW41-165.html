MARX TO CARL SIEBEL</p>
<p>IN BARMEN</p>
<p>28 March 1861 c/o (Letter to me to be enclosed in an envelope) 13 Bellevuestrasse, Berlin, Dr F. Lassalle</p>
<p>Dear Siebel,</p>
<p>The secret of my journey, which win. HAVE PUZZLED you to some extent, is as follows:</p>
<p>As a result of the crisis in America the <i>Cyclopaedia Americana,</i><sup>1</sup> to which I was a contributor, has been completely suspended; similarly my contributions to the <i>Tribune,</i> my main resource, have been suspended until the end of April, and reduced by half for the period immediately thereafter <i>(apart from myself all</i> their European correspondents have been provisionally dismissed). This was compounded by a double misfortune: <i>Herr Vogt,</i> which, combined with the lawsuit, etc., cost me nearly £100, and a frightful stroke of ill-luck in that my wife (although twice vaccinated) caught small-pox and was ill for two months during which time I had to run two households, since the children couldn't remain at home.</p>
<p>So, I had to look round for other resources. Party friends here had already proposed to me starting a newspaper<sup>3</sup> in the autumn. Hence my presence here. More in my next.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I have run into financial difficulties here (I shan't be staying much longer). If you could lend me 100-150 talers, you would oblige me.</p>
<p>Before returning to England I intend to see you at <i>all</i> events, if only on account of the newspaper project (for which 20,000 talers are READY). So, you must write and tell me, at <i>all</i> events, at which inn in Elberfeld I might best put up for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. Marx

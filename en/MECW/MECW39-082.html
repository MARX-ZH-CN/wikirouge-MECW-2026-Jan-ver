MARX TO HEINRICH BROCKHAUS
<br>IN LEIPZIG
<br>London, 19 August 1852 28 Dean Street, Soho Dear Sir,
<br>I am writing to you to ask whether you could use in your <i>Gegenwart</i> a paper on 'Recent Literature on the Economy in England, from 1830-1852'. So far as I am aware, no work of this kind has yet been published either in English or in German. It would cover 1. general works on political economy, 2. specialised writings which appeared during that period, in so far as they relate to really important controversies, for instance on population, the colonies, the banking question, protective tariffs and free trade, etc.
<br>Should you feel inclined to fall in with this proposal, I should have to know the length prescribed for such a paper by the economics of your publication, since the subdivision of the whole would have to be arranged accordingly.
<br>Another paper which might perhaps be pertinent just now is 'The Present State of the Parties', i.e. those that will confront each other in the next Parliament. Awaiting your reply, I am
<br>Yours faithfully
<br>Dr K. Marx

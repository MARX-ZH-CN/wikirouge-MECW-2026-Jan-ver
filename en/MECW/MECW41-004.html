<p><i>To Engels in Manchester</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 25 January 1860</b></p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Have you already heard about Vogt's pamphlet, in which there are the most horrible scurrilities concerning me? And, what is more, the thing is being jubilantly acclaimed by the Teutonic bourgeoisie. The first edition has already been sold out. Yesterday, a <b>leader</b> in the <i>National-Zeitung</i> contained a long defamatory passage from it. (Any chance of your laying hands on this particular number of the <i>Nat.-Zeit</i>.? I haven't been able to get hold of it here.) Now, what ought I to do? Mr Lassalle would seem to have taken such umbrage at my last letter that there hasn't been a word from him since.</p>
<p>I should be grateful if you could have an article <b>ready</b> for Friday or Saturday (there is a ship sailing via Cork).</p>
<p>Salut.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.
</p>

MARX TO ENGELS
<br>IN MANCHESTER
<br>[London,] 8 December 1866
<br>Dear FRED,
<br>Meissner has not begun printing yet,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> as he wanted to finish off some other things first. I am expecting a letter from him next Monday. All in all, I found the delay by no means disagreeable, as I have only been rid of that vile carbuncle for a few days, and, moreover, my creditors are badgering me in a truly edifying manner. I only regret that private persons CAN not FILE THEIR BILLS FOR THE BANKRUPTCY COURT with the same propriety as men of business.
<br>A while ago, <i>Kladderadatsch</i> printed a swipe at the <i>Brimstone Gang</i> in large type, in a bad lampoon on Collins' <i>The Woman in White.</i> The author of this garbage is that miserable Bettziech, and I should not be surprised if the order had emanated from Kinkel or Hatzfeldt. Nor have I any doubt that the old bag was the cause of Liebknecht's arrest.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>The Prussian swine are acting precisely as we should wish them to. There will be no progress until heads roll.
<br><i>Salut.</i>
<br>Your
<br>K. M.

Drama in 5 Acten mit freier Benutzung  von Wilkie Collins,</i> which was directed against Marx and his comrades. Its author was Heinrich Bettziech, a German petty-bourgeois democrat, who wrote under the pen-name of Beta.<br>The<i> Brimstone Gang</i> was the name of a students' association at Jena University in the 1770s which was notorious for its members' brawls; subsequently, the expression 'Brimstone Gang' became widespread.<br>In his pamphlet<i> Mein Prozeß gegen die 'Allgemeine Zeitung'</i> which was published in 1859 the petty-bourgeois democrat Karl Vogt called Marx and his party comrades 'the Brimstone Gang'. However, this was a jocular name for a group of German émigrés that existed in Geneva in 1849 and 1850 with which Marx and his supporters were not connected. Marx exposed Vogt's slander in his pamphlet<i> Herr Vogt</i> which was published in 1860 (see present edition, Vol. 17). Wilhelm Liebknecht was arrested in Berlin on 2 October 1866 after he had made an anti-government speech in the Berlin Printers' Union. He was sentenced to three months imprisonment.</br></br></span>

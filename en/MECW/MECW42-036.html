<p><i>To Engels in Manchester</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 1 February 1865</b></p>
<p>Dear <b>Frederick</b>,</p>
<p>Enclosed letter from Strohn to be returned; write to me and let me know your thoughts about the publishing business at the same time.</p>
<p>This 'Siebold' is the Siebold of champagne fame, <b>no doubt about that</b>. I really am rather afraid that he did not merely find my reception of his bubbly enthusiasm very dry, but <b>that he caught some queer words at Gumpert's door, as I told you at the time</b>. At all events, it is nice of the fellow and quite typical of wine-salesman politics to go straight from us to Karl Blind and run as his <b>messenger</b> to Hamburg. Has Blind perhaps also placed an order for 'sparkling wines' and granted his most gracious protection to scum-scoundrelism as well? I hope for the sake of bubbly's good reputation that Siebold is no such <b>venal</b> scum, although there was no mistaking that while one of his eyes was sparkling with enthusiasm, the other <b>had an eye to business</b>. Regarding Freiligrath, I <b>feel sure</b> that he is much <b>too cautious</b> to agree <i>publicly</i> in any way to collaborate <i>(in partibus</i> [to all appearances], it goes without saying) with Blind. <b>However, I shall try to ascertain the fact</b>. At all events, it is very good that Strohn has so gratifyingly baulked Ruge and Blind. I sent off a few sarcastic marginalia to him earlier today, intended specifically for Meissner, concerning the <i>nobile par</i> of antagonistic brothers.</p>
<p>You must excuse the scraps of English in my epistle as there was a <b>sitting of the Council</b> yesterday which lasted until <b>One o'clock</b>. ('Liquor' and 'smoke' are <i>banned</i> from these '<b>sittings'.</b>) The first thing was the answering epistle from Lincoln, which you may find in tomorrow's <i>Times</i> and certainly in <i>The Daily News</i> and <i>The Star.</i> In the reply to the <b>London Emancipation Society</b> (which counts among its members such illustrious figures as Sir Charles Lyell and the 'Voice of World History', alias K.B.), published in yesterday's <i>Evening Star,</i> the old man drily dismisses the fellows with two formal clichés, exactly as he had done in his earlier answer to the <i>Manchester</i> branch of the <b>Emancipation Society</b>; whereas his letter to us is in fact everything we could have asked for, and, in particular, the naive assurance that the <i>United States</i> could not involve itself directly in '<b>propagandism'.</b> At any rate, it is the only answer so far <b>on the part of the Old Man</b> that is more than a strictly formal one.</p>
<p><i>Secondly,</i> a delegate was there from the Poles (<i>aristocrats</i>), who have links with the '<b>Literary Society',</b> through whom these gentlemen conveyed their solemn assurance, with an eye to the forthcoming <b>meeting</b> on Poland, that they are <i>democrats</i> and that every Pole is <i>now</i> a democrat, since the aristocracy has dwindled away to such a degree that they would be <i>mad</i> not to recognise the <i>impossibility</i> of restoring Poland without a peasant rising. <b>Whether</b> or not these fellows believe what they say, at all events, the last lesson they had does not seem to have been entirely wasted on them.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly,</i> there were statements from various <b>trades unions</b> about their joining. Ditto from an association in <i>Brussels</i> which is promising to organise branches throughout Belgium.</p>
<p>I then handed over an issue of the <i>Daily St. Louis Press</i> which had arrived just yesterday containing leader about our '<b>Address to the Workingmen'</b> and an excerpt from it which had obviously been arranged by Weydemeyer.</p>
<p>But now the most remarkable thing of all.</p>
<p>Cremer, <b>our Honorary General Secretary</b>, had received a written invitation for the '<b>Council'</b> as well as a private visit, from a <b>Provisional Committee</b> which is meeting <i>privatim</i> at the London Tavern next Monday. Object: <b>Monster meeting</b> for <b>Manhood Suffrage</b>. <i>Chairman: — Richard Cobden!</i></p>
<p>The point is this: as E. Jones told us previously, these fellows have been a complete failure in Manchester. They have therefore adopted <b>a broader platform</b>, in which <b>registration 'for paying poor rate'</b> figured instead of <b>Manhood Suffrage</b>, however. That is what is stated in the printed circular sent to us. However, since various indications made it clear to them that nothing less than <b>Manhood Suffrage</b> can attract <b>any co-operation whatever on the part of the working classes</b>, they have announced they are prepared to accept the latter. A <i>big</i> demonstration in London would lead to similar ones in the provinces, write the provincials 'yet once again', having 'all ready' realised that they are not able <b>to set the ball a-going</b>.</p>
<p>The next question raised yesterday was this: should our <b>Society, i.e. Council</b>, agree to what these fellows want (they include all the old <b>sham city agitators</b> such as Sam. Morley, etc.) and send a few delegates to attend the transactions of their provisional committee as 'watchmen'? Secondly, if these fellows pledge themselves <i>directly</i> to the slogan of <b>manhood suffrage</b> and the <b>public meeting</b> is being called under this slogan, should we promise our support? <i>The latter</i> is, you see, just as crucial to these fellows as it was in the American business. Without the <b>Trades Unions</b>, no mass <b>meeting</b> is possible, and without us, the <b>Trades Unions</b> are not to be had. This is also the reason why these gentlemen have come to us.</p>
<p>Opinions were <i>very</i> divided, for which <i>Bright's</i> latest silly tricks in Birmingham were much to blame.</p>
<p>On my motion, it was decided that: 1) the delegation should be sent (in my motion, I excluded <b>foreigners</b> from it; but Eccarius and Lubez were elected on to it as 'Englishmen' and <i>silent</i> witnesses) just as 'observers'; 2) <b>so far as the meeting is concerned</b>, we should act with them <i>firstly</i> if <b>manhood suffrage</b> is proclaimed directly and publicly in the programme, and <i>secondly</i> if people <i>selected by us</i> are included on the <i>permanent</i> committee, so that they can keep an eye on those fellows and compromise them in the event of fresh treachery, which, as I made plain to all of them, is <i>at any rate intended.</i> I am writing to E. Jones about the matter today.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.

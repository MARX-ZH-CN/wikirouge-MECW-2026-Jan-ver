ENGELS TO HERMANN SCHLÜTER</p>
<p>IN HOTTINGEN-ZURICH</p>
<p>[London,] 28 July 1884</p>
<p>Dear Mr Schlüter,</p>
<p>Proofs<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>returned herewith.<br>
Shall continue to return<br>
them promptly. But I would ask you to be rather more indulgent with my spelling; I have no cause in my advancing years to let myself be either civilised or centralised, let alone cited. Supposedly 'consistent' spelling is usually far less consistent and far less historical than the good old casualness.</p>
<p>I am in full agreement with your suggestions. However these are things you know more about than I do.</p>
<p>I would now ask you to be good enough to let me have the final proofs and, when the book is ready, 25 copies of the deluxe edition and 5 of the other; I shall not be able to manage with less.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>To save postage, the ms. can be sent <i>with</i> the proofs in a stiff, strong wrapper; over here mss. and proofs are both charged as book post. They must, however, carry the <i>full</i> amount of stamps, otherwise they won't arrive here.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>F. Engels

Of the total edition of 5,000 copies, 1,000 would be passed on to the publisher Jakob Schabelitz for distribution in Germany.</span>

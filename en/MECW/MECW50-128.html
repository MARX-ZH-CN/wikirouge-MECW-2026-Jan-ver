ENGELS TO FLORENCE KELLEY-WISCHNEWETZKY</p>
<p>IN CHICAGO</p>
<p>London 11 November 1893<br>
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Mrs Kelley,</p>
<p>I have received from Swan Sonnenschein a/c Sales<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> for July 92—June 93 as follows:</p>
<p>Regular Sales 50 (plus 4—13 Copies) 3/6. — £8.15. Special Sales 51 (one copy to America!) <i>4.8.9 £13.3.93</i><br>
121/2% of which = <i>£1.12.11</i></p>
<p>As I am not certain whether your last address (Hull House, 335 s. Halsted St. Chicago) still holds good, I think it safer to send the cheque to our friend Mr Sorge of Hoboken who will forward it to you as soon as you let him know that you have received this note.</p>
<p>We now and then see short reports of your activity in the papers, among others your speech in the Labor Congress, and are glad to find that you have found congenial work. With kind regards from Mrs Kautsky and myself</p>
<p>I remain Yours very truly</p>
<p>F. Engels

<p>TO G. BLUME IN HAMBURG</p>
<p><br>
London, 27 December 1890</p>
<p>Dear Comrade,</p>
<p>Mr Stinzleih has passed on to me the kind greetings conveyed by you on behalf of the delegates to the Congress, the representatives of 596,000 German working men. There is no need for me to tell you in so many words how glad I was to be remembered at that Congress. Unfortunately I am unable to thank those concerned, who will by now have dispersed to all parts of Germany, and can do no more than express my sincere thanks to you, Mr Chairman, while giving you my firm assurance that, so long as it remains in my power, I shall persevere in the struggle for the emancipation of the working class.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>F. Engels

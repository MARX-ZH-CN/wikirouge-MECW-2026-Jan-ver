ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 29 April 1870</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>I wrote immediately to Borkheim,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> addressed to 10 Brunswick Gardens, Kensington W.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> If that is not correct, be so good as to notify him.</p>
<p>I would, in fact, have been glad to come over to see Schapper, and would still do so, had not your letter led me to assume he was already dead. There was always something so elementally revolutionary about him, and even if the poor fellow has to go sometime, I am pleased at least that he is behaving so finely to the end. If, as the result of the pleurisy, he has contracted consumption, then there is nothing to be done, and it will happen very quickly.</p>
<p>Bakunin's letter is really very naïve.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> What hard luck for the world, were it not a ghastly lie, if there were 40,000 revolutionary students in Russia, without a proletariat or even a revolutionary peasantry behind them, and with any career ahead of them except the dilemma: Siberia, or emigration to Western Europe. If there were anything that could ruin the West European movement, it would be the importation of these 40,000±<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> educated, ambitious, hungry Russian nihilists; all of them officer cadets without an army, which we should provide them; a marvellous piece of impertinence that, in order to bring unity to the European proletariat, it must be commanded in Russian! Yet however greatly Bakunin exaggerates, it is as clear as day that the danger exists. <i>CattTafi</i> Pycb<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> will spit out a certain number of these 'careerless' Russians every year, and, with the excuse of the <i>principe international,</i> they will creep in everywhere amongst the workers, swindle their way into leading roles, carry their private intrigues and brawls—unavoidable amongst the Russians—into the sections, and then the GENERAL COUNCIL will have its work cut out. It has already struck me that Utine has already found a way to obtain a position with the Genevans. And these Russians moan that, back at home, all positions are occupied by Germans!</p>
<p>I have had it out in all friendship with Wilhelm on various points, both about his previous attitude and also about his present attitude in the Reichstag. Bonhorst was arrested in Eschweiler because he lacked legitimation papers, after <i>the Reichstag</i> had passed the Passport Abolition Law, yet Monsieur Liebknecht misses the chance to interpellate the government about flagrant illegality and to force it to confess that such laws are in no way intended to apply to workers. And the jackasses expect the workers to re-elect them. Incidentally, I have also written to Bracke, who approached me for money for the 'Party', saying how necessary it is that they should nominate worker candidates and force them through everywhere. Wilhelm is capable of saying that this is not necessary at all.</p>
<p>The Spanish papers and the <i>Flag</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> —received with thanks. When I travelled past Majorca in 1849 I would not have dreamed that, in 20 years, we would have a paper<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> there. At the time that hole was regarded as a Corsican wilderness.</p>
<p>Pigott remains the same ambiguous figure. In Ireland they must have a 'Republic', but the French should remain under Bonaparte. They will pass over my book<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> in silence when it appears, just as they do now with the Irish articles in the <i>Marseillaise.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The ancient laws of Ireland,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> through which I am at present rummaging, are a bitter mouthful. First, the text itself is not very clear, since it assumes a knowledge of <i>all</i> ancient Irish law, which no longer exists. 2. It is very garbled. 3. The translation is bad, and in places definitely wrong, but it is clear that the agrarian conditions were not quite as simple as good old <i>Davies</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> —with interest—described them. The laws insofar as published, give only the complicated side, not the simple one. Incidentally, I am not yet through with the stuff; from time to time I am forced to refer to the Celtic text, too, and since I don't even have a grammar, I don't get along very fast. But so much is clear: the editors, for all their knowledge of Celtic, don't understand the contents any more than I do.</p>
<p>These things have been published at state cost by the COMMISSIONERS FOR THE PUBLICATION OF THE ANCIENT LAWS AND INSTITUTES OF IRELAND.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> It is obviously a gruelling job. <i>In which PARLIAMENTARY PAPER can one find out how much these fellows cost annually?</i> They have been in session since 1852, do nothing except engage WORKING UNDERSTRAPPERS, and these two volumes are all that has appeared so far.</p>
<p>Best greetings to you all.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

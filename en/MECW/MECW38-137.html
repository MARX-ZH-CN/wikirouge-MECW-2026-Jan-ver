<br>TO HERMANN BECKER IN COLOGNE
<br>[London, about 1 February 1851]
<br><br>
...You would very greatly oblige me by sending me Willich's letters.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Partly because we here by the rivers of Babylon<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> should also be vouchsafed a share of your Homeric laughter. And on the other hand because the man is exploiting the 'alleged' connection in order to brag in front of foreigners and, at the same time, make denunciations. Finally I feel it necessary that you should convey a note to him, either through me or direct, in which you most politely decline further correspondence on the grounds that, while humour may not greatly endanger him in London, for you in Cologne—and not for you alone but, by way of repercussion, for our party comrades in Germany—its effects may be dire. And what could be more ominous and at the same time more absurd than to be nailed to the cross as a result of a trick played through some mere whim of the 'carpenter's'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> ...

MARX TO ENGELS
<br>IN MANCHESTER
<br>[London,] 29 April 1854 28 Dean Street, Soho
<br>Dear Engels,
<br>A few days before Heise left I had a scene with him in the presence of others over 'The Knight of the Noble Consciousness'. He came out against us as the Knight's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> steadfast (secret) supporter or AT LEAST as a venomous INDEPENDENT. The affair brewed up into a scandal. I thought it unnecessary to write to you about it 1. because you knew Heise well enough, 2. because he wrote to me, humbly asking to be recommended to you and I didn't want to give him a letter of Uriah.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>The man may, of course, have come over to us altogether, though I cannot regard his attaching himself to us when in need as proof of this. <i>At all events</i>, I feel that you, for your part, shouldn't get too deeply involved with Heise. Temper your trust in him and above all do not write anything <i>jointly</i> with the lad. Before he can be co-opted and thus 'set up' in the eyes of the public, MORE PROOFS OF HIS SINCERITY ARE WANTED. We have had too many beastly experiences not to have become cautious and <i>tant soit peu</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> mistrustful.
<br>Letter enclosed with cuttings from Cluss.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> <br>Imandt informs me that Blanc told him you had written to Blanc saying you would be coming up here on a visit. Is there anything in it?
<br>Your
<br>K. M.

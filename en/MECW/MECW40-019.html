ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 26 May 1856</p>
<p>Dear Marx,</p>
<p>Herewith the article,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>but you should read it over first. Today the office again prevented me from doing so myself.</p>
<p>Bazancourt<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>will be of some use—Bonaparte's <i>Bat- rachomyomachia.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>But Vol. I absolutely essential. I shall send you 6/- worth of stamps for it tomorrow, or rather, they are enclosed herewith.</p>
<p>I would advise you to pack your bags at once, taking such papers as are absolutely necessary. Then you can work here as well as in Scotland, at least on certain subjects. We could do Bazancourt ±<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>together.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>Admittedly, you would have to do most of the work for, with business expanding rapidly, commerce is making such demands on me that there can be no thought of regular and sustained work. If you finished this thing here (1 article would of course suffice), you could always either do parliamentary articles here, or else take a trip to Scotland and get down to some hard work here on your return. Until the Pan-Slavism is finished I should be reluctant to saddle myself with</p>
<p>any other promises which I might eventually be unable to fulfil; but after all, your health is also a consideration and, as to that, I think I have something good for you—viz. light Bavarian beer and another dozen or so botdes of Bordeaux. Better, at all events—with a change of air—than HALF AND HALF, etc.</p>
<p>I may drop you another line tomorrow. Let me know what you decide to do.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

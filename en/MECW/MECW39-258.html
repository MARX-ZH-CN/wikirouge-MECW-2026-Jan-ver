MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>London, 17 January 1855</p>
<p>Dear Frederic,</p>
<p>I could not, OF COURSE, write to the <i>Tribune</i> yesterday nor can I do so for some time à <i>venir</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>because yesterday morning, between 6 and 7 o'clock, my wife was delivered of a <i>bona fide</i> TRAVELLER<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>— unfortunately OF THE 'SEX' <i>par excellence</i>. If it had been a male child, well and good.</p>
<p>Did you know that red Wolff<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>is one of the <i>Augsburger'</i>s London correspondents? I found out by chance, namely by reading an article in the said paper<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>containing all manner of fatuous elucubrations on 'house' and 'home' and 'abroad'—all this to throw light on the 'ordure' with which the British troops are contending at Balaklava. I saw Freiligrath and told him that in the Augsburg <i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i> I'd read some nonsense of which only Lupus Rufus could be capable. Freiligrath thereupon confirmed that Wolff was the 'REAL, IDENTICAL Kobes'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>I now have Heine's 3 volumes at home. Amongst other things he retails at some length a lie to the effect that I, etc., went to console him after he had been 'attacked' in the Augsburg <i>A.Z.</i> for having accepted money from Louis Philippe<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>/ The good Heine deliberately forgets that my intervention on his behalf took place at the end of 1843 and thus could have no connection with FACTS which came to light <i>after</i> the February revolution of 1848.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>BUT LET IT PASS. Worried by his evil conscience,—the old dog has a monstrous memory for such things,—he is trying to ingratiate himself.</p>
<p>I expect something from you on FRIDAY,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>then. I can't write any more today, having to send out a mass of cards giving notification of the baby's birth.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

ENGELS TO JOHANN PHILIPP BECKER<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN GENEVA</p>
<p>London, 15 March 1883</p>
<p>Dear Old Man,</p>
<p>Rejoice that you saw Marx once more last autumn,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> you will never see him again. Yesterday afternoon, at 2.45, when he had been left on his own for barely two minutes, we found him peacefully asleep in his chair. The most powerful intellect our party possessed had ceased to think, the stoutest heart I have ever known was beating no more. An internal haemorrhage would seem to be indicated.</p>
<p>We two are now pretty well all that is left of the old guard of the days before '48. Well, we shall continue to man the breach. Though bullets may whistle and friends fall, it won't be the first time we two have seen that happen. And if one of us is hit by a bullet — well and good, provided only it is properly lodged so that one isn't left writhing for too long.</p>
<p>Your old comrade in arms,</p>
<p>F. Engels

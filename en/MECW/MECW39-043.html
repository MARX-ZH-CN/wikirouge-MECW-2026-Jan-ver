MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>London, 24 April 1852 28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Frederic,</p>
<p>You cannot imagine what a wretched time I had last week. On the day of the funeral, the money I had been promised from various quarters failed to arrive, so that I was finally compelled to go to some French neighbours in order to pay the English vultures. And on top of this, alas, a letter arrived from Weydemeyer giving reason to suppose that in America, too, all our hopes have been dashed. Cluss, whose letter you will be getting next week, now holds out better prospects. <i>Quoique de dure complexion</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I was, on this occasion, very hard hit by the wretched business.</p>
<p>Enclosed a letter from that cur Ewerbeck, who never uses a stamp and consistently robs one of one's last lOd. Then an article by B. Bauer from the <i>Daily New-York Tribune</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> to whose pages your article<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> has attracted all the rag-tag and bobtail. Bauer's revelations about 'the armies' will make you laugh. If you are going to send me articles for Dana now, wait until you have several so that I can send them all off at once.</p>
<p>Mr Tellering is publishing a monthly or weekly in New York; the cur himself sent me the first issue—unadulterated third-form drivel.</p>
<p>Heise (of the <i>Hornisse</i>) is now an intimate of Willich's. They are as thick as thieves. What can he see in the fellow? Once again they are bragging about a proposed coup in Germany.</p>
<p>Dronke is a real <i>imbécile</i>. His appetite whetted by the £4 we got for him from the Rhineland, he went to Coblenz in the hopes of extorting some more. It never occurred to the jackass that he would be providing fresh ammunition for use against the people in Cologne.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> The fellow's behaviour is really too disgraceful.</p>
<p>Apropos. Do not forget to send <i>immédiatement</i> two notes to London as follows: 1. for <i>Liebknecht</i>, empowering him to obtain the £1 from <i>Hain</i>. 2. Write a brief note yourself to Hain, telling your 'good friend' in a couple of lines that, having heard he was doing well, you had referred Liebknecht to him <i>re</i> the £ 1. We must be careful not to make an enemy of him.</p>
<p>The fact is that one of our acquaintances, who has hitherto found shelter for the night at Liebknecht's lodgings, was thrown out by the latter's landlords, and not one of us has been able to raise a penny for the poor devil. Accordingly I yesterday sent Liebknecht a note in which I told him you had referred him to Hain <i>re</i> the £1. Mr Hain appeared somewhat incredulous and told Liebknecht he must first see it in your handwriting.</p>
<p>Let me have a few STAMPS, for I have a mass of stuff to send you.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

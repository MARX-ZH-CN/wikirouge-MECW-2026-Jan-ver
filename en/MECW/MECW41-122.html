MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 21 November 1860</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Since Monday,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> my wife has been prostrated by an extremely virulent nervous fever. Yesterday, on Dr Allen's orders, I found all 3 children lodgings away from home, for he was afraid of a possible infection. Allen says the illness is a dangerous one, but he <i>hopes</i> she'll pull through. Last Saturday my wife was already feeling most unwell and I noticed symptoms of fever, and therefore wanted to call the doctor. But she refused. Sunday ditto. On Monday, of course, I wouldn't be put off any longer, and she herself felt that it wasn't just any ordinary cold or some such.</p>
<p>Szemere's here. Will also be passing through Manchester and will call on you.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

ENGELS TO JENNY MARX LONGUET
<br>IN PARIS
<br>[Manchester, 9 July 1869]
<br>affairs are regularly settled, which will take about a month. In the meantime I walk about a good deal with Tussy and as many of the family, humane and canine, as I can induce to go with us. We have just come back from a long walk through the fields to Heaton Chapel, about 5 or 6 miles the way we went, Tussy, Lizzie, Mary Ellen,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> myself and two dogs, and I am specially instructed to inform you that these two amiable ladies had two glasses of beer <i>a-piece</i> (this is the vernacular Lancashire in which I got my orders). No wonder I had to bring them home by the train (we have a station about seven minutes' walk from our house), but no sooner arrived, than they walked, in common with me, into your Lager-Beer. Now they are getting their tea ready, or getting themselves ready for it, I don't know which, and after that there will be a reading of Irish novels which is likely to last till bedtime or nearly so, unless relieved by a bit of talk about the 'convicted nation'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Anyhow, they seem to like it, and so it's all right to me.
<br>Meanwhile they all send you the heartiest greetings, and I'll do the same.
<br>Your with all my heart
<br>F. Engels
<br>If you and Moor don't go to Germany before the end of this month or if you don't return before the end of September, <i>I</i> may possibly meet you there somewhere.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>

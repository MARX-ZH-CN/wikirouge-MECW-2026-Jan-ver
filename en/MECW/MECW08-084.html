<h3 class="mw-headline" id="ME8-84-2"><i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> No. 201, January 21, 1849</h3><a id="Neue_Rheinische_Zeitung_No._201,_January_21,_1849"></a>
<p><b>Cologne, January 20.</b> The "honorable" Joseph Dumont allows an anonymous writer, who is not paid by him but pays him and who in the feuilleton seeks to work upon the Primary voters, to address the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> in the following way:<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Neue Rheinische Zeitung, the Organ of Democracy, has been pleased to take notice of the articles published in this paper under the title "To the Primary Voters", and to state that they were borrowed from the Neue Preussische Zeitung.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"In face of this lie, we simply declare that these articles are paid for as advertisements, and that, with the exception of the first one borrowed from the Parlaments-Korrespondenz, they were written in Cologne and their author has up to now not even seen, let alone read, the Neue Preussische Zeitung."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We understand how important it is for Montesquieu LVI to authenticate his property. We also understand how important for Herr Dumont is the statement that he is "paid" even for the leaflets and advertisements which he sets up, prints and distributes in the interest of his class, the bourgeoisie. As for the anonymous writer, he is aware of the French saying: "Les beaux esprits se rencontrent." It is not his fault that his own intellectual products and those of the Neue Preussische Zeitung and of the "Prussian Associations"<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> are as alike as two peas. We have never read his advertisements in the Kolnische Zeitung, but the leaflets produced by Dumont's printing-house and sent to us from various quarters, we deemed worthy of a casual glance. Now, however, comparison has shown us that the same stuff plays the simultaneous role of advertisement and leaflet.</p>
<p>In order to atone for the injustice we have done to the anonymous Montesquieu LVI we have imposed upon ourselves the harsh penance of reading all his advertisements in the Kolnische Zeitung and making his intellectual private property available to the German public as "common property". Here is wisdom! Montesquieu LVI is chiefly concerned with the social question. He has found the "easiest and simplest way" to solve it, and he extols his Morrison pill<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> with the unctuous, naively shameless pathos of a quack.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The easiest and simplest way to achieve this however" (that is, the solution of the social question) "is to accept the constitution imposed on December 5, 1848, revise it, then make everyone swear allegiance to it, and thus to establish it. This is our only way to salvation. Consequently, any man who has a sympathetic heart for the misery of his poor brothers, who wants to feed the hungry and clothe the naked... anyone, in short, who wants to solve the social question... should not vote for anyone who is opposed to the constitution" (Montesquieu LVI).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vote for Brandenburg, Manteuffel, Ladenberg, and the social question will be solved in the "simplest" and "easiest way"! Vote for Dumont, Camphausen, Wittgenstein or else for minor gods such as Compes and Mevissen -- and the social question will be solved! The "social question" for a vote! He who "wants to feed the hungry and clothe the naked" should vote for Hansemann and Stupp! One social question less for each vote! Acceptance of the imposed constitution -- that is the solution of the social problem!</p>
<p>We do not for a moment doubt that neither Montesquieu LVI nor his patrons in the Citizens' Associations<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> will wait for the imposed constitution to be accepted, revised, sworn, and promulgated before "feeding the hungry and clothing the naked". Appropriate measures have already been taken.</p>
<p>During the last few weeks circulars have been distributed in which capitalists inform craftsmen, shopkeepers, and others that, considering the present state of affairs and the revival of credit, the rate of interest, for philanthropical reasons, has been raised from 4 to 5 per cent. First solution of the social question!</p>
<p>The municipal council of Cologne has in the same spirit drawn up a "Worker's Card" for the unfortunate people who must either starve or sell their hands to the city (cf. No. 187 of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung). It will be remembered that under this Charter, imposed on the workers, the worker who has lost his job is bound by contract to place himself under police surveillance. Second solution of the social question!</p>
<p>Shortly after the March events, the municipal council established an eating-house in Cologne at cost prices, beautifully furnished, with fine rooms that could be heated, etc. After the imposition of the constitution other premises were substituted for this, premises managed by the poor-law administration, where there is no heating, no crockery, where food may not be consumed on the spot and where a quart of indescribable gruel costs eight pfennigs. Third solution of the social question!</p>
<p>While they ruled Vienna the workers guarded the banks, the houses and the wealth of the bourgeois, who had fled. These same bourgeois, on their return, denounced these workers to Windischgratz as "robbers" who ought to be hanged. Unemployed who applied to the municipal council were put into the army to fight Hungary. Fourth solution of the social question!</p>
<p>In Breslau the wretched people who were obliged to seek refuge in the poor house were calmly exposed to cholera by the municipal council and the government who deprived them of the most essential physical necessaries of life, and took notice of the victims of their cruel charity only when they themselves were attacked by the disease. Fifth solution of the social question!</p>
<p>In the Berlin association "with God for King and Country", a supporter of the imposed constitution declared that it was distressing that in order to further one's interests and plans one still had to pay compliments to the "proletariat".</p>
<p>That is the solution of the "solution of the social question"!</p>
<p>"The Prussian spies are so dangerous because they are never paid but are always hoping to be paid," says our friend Heine. And the Prussian bourgeois are so dangerous because they never pay but always promise to pay.</p>
<p>An election costs the English and French bourgeois quite a lot of money. Their corrupt practices are well known. The Prussian bourgeoisie are very shrewd! They are much too virtuous and upright to dip into their pocket; they pay with the "solution of the social question". And that costs nothing. Montesquieu LVI, however, as Dumont officially assures us, pays at least for the advertisements in the Kolnische Zeitung and appends -- gratis -- the solution of the "social question".</p>
<p>The practical part of our Montesquieu's petites oeuvres thus boils down to the following: vote for Brandenburg, Manteuffel, Ladenberg! Elect Camphausen and Hansemann! Send us to Berlin, let our people establish themselves there. That is the solution of the social question.</p>
<p>The immortal Hansemann has solved these problems. First, the establishment of law and order to revive credit. Then, the solution of the "social question" with powder and shot, as in 1844, when "my dear Silesian weavers ought to be helped".</p>
<p>Hence, vote for the advocates of the imposed constitution!</p>
<p>But Montesquieu LVI accepts the imposed constitution only to be able afterwards to "revise" and "swear allegiance to it"! Montesquieu, my good man! Once you have accepted the constitution you can revise it only on its own basis, that is, in so far as it suits the King and the second Chamber consisting of country squires, financial magnates, high-ranking officials and clerics. The only possible revision has been judiciously indicated in the imposed constitution itself. It consists in abandoning the constitutional system and restoring the former Christian-Germanic system of estates.</p>
<p>After the acceptance of the imposed constitution this is the only possible and only permitted revision, which cannot have escaped the shrewd Montesquieu.</p>
<p>Thus the essays of Montesquieu LVI, in their practical part, amount to this: vote for Hansemann and Camphausen! Vote for Dumont and Stupp! Vote for Brandenburg and Manteuffel! Accept the imposed constitution! Elect delegates who accept the imposed constitution -- and all this under the pretext of solving the "social question".</p>
<p>What the hell does the pretext matter to us, when it is a question of the imposed constitution.</p>
<p>But our Montesquieu of course prefaces his practical instructions for the solution of "the social question", the quintessence of his monumental work, with a theoretical part. Let us examine this theoretical part. The profound thinker explains first what the "social questions" are.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And so, what, in effect, is the social question?
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Human beings must and want to live.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"To live they need dwellings, clothes and food.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Dwellings and clothes are not produced by nature at all, and only a scanty and by no means sufficient amount of food grows naturally.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hence man himself must procure everything to satisfy these needs.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"This he does by labor.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Labor, therefore, is the first condition of our life; without labor we cannot live.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Among primitive peoples everybody built his own hut, made his own clothes from animal skins and gathered fruit for his meals. That was the primitive state.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"But if man needs nothing beyond shelter, clothes and food, if he satisfies merely his physical wants, then he remains at the same level as the animals, for animals can do this too.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"But man is a higher being than an animal, he needs more, he needs joy, he must raise himself to moral values. But he can do that only if he lives in society.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"But when men began to live in societies entirely new conditions arose. They soon perceived that work was much easier when each individual performed only one particular job. Thus, one made clothes, another built houses, a third provided food, and the first gave the second what he lacked. The various estates of men thus developed automatically, one becoming a hunter, another a craftsman, and a third a cultivator. But men did not stop at this, for humanity must go forward. People began to invent. They invented spinning and weaving, they learned to forge iron and tan hides. The more inventions were made the more diverse did the crafts become, and the easier did farming become with the aid of the plough and spade which the handicrafts gave it. All helped each other and co-operated. Then intercourse started with neighboring peoples; one people had what the other needed, and the latter possessed things which the former lacked. These were exchanged. Thus trading arose, that is, a new branch of human activity. Thus culture advanced step by step; from the first clumsy inventions through the centuries down to the inventions of our day.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Thus, science and art arose among men and life became richer and more varied... The physician treated the sick, the clergyman preached, the merchant traded, the farmer tilled the land, the gardener grew flowers, the mason built houses, for which the carpenter made the furniture, the miller ground flour from which the baker baked bread. Everything was interconnected, no one could live in isolation, nobody could satisfy all his needs himself.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"These are the social relations.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"They have arisen quite naturally of their own accord. And if today you make a revolution which destroys the very foundations of these relations, and if tomorrow you start life anew, then relations exactly the same as the Present ones will arise again. This was so for thousands of years among all the nations on earth. And if anyone draws a distinction between the workers and the bourgeoisie this is a big lie. We all work, each in his own way, each according to his strength and abilities. The physician works when he visits the sick, the musician when he plays a dance tune, the merchant when he writes his letters. Everyone works, each at his job."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is wisdom! He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p>What, then, in effect is the physiological question? Every material being presupposes a certain weight, density, etc.</p>
<p>Every organic body consists of various component parts, each of which performs its own special function, and reciprocal interaction takes place between the organs.</p>
<p>"These are physiological relations."</p>
<p>Montesquieu LVI cannot be denied an original talent for simplifying science. He ought to be granted a patent (without government guarantee).</p>
<p>The products of labor cannot be produced without labor. One cannot reap without sowing, one cannot have yarn without weaving, etc. Europe will bend in admiration before the great genius who here, in Cologne, without any aid from the Neue Preussische Zeitung has himself brought these truths to light.</p>
<p>In their work men enter into certain relations with one another. There takes place a division of labor which may be more or less diversified. One person bakes, another forges one person agitates, another howls,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> Montesquieu writes and Dumont prints. Adam Smith, acknowledge thy master!</p>
<p>The discoveries that labor and the division of labor are essential conditions of every human society enable Montesquieu LVI to draw the conclusion that the existence of "various estates" is quite natural, that the distinction between "bourgeoisie and proletariat" is a "big lie", that even if a "revolution" were completely to destroy the existing "social relations" today, "relations exactly the same as the present ones will arise again", and finally that for anyone who has "a sympathetic heart for the misery of his poor brothers" and who wishes to gain the respect of Montesquieu LVI, it is absolutely necessary to elect delegates in keeping with the ideas of Manteuffel and the imposed constitution.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This was so for thousands of years among all the nations on earth"!! In Egypt there was labor and division of labor -- and castes; in Greece and Rome labor and division of labor-and free men and slaves; in the Middle Ages labor and division of labor -- and feudal lords and serfs, guilds, estates, etc. In our day there is labor and division of labor -- and classes, one of which owns all means of production and all means of subsistence, while the other lives only so long as it sells its labor, and it sells its labor only so long as the employing class enriches itself by purchasing this labor.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it not obvious, therefore, that "for thousands of years the same conditions existed among all the nations on earth" as in Prussia today, since labor and division of labor always existed in one form or another? Or is it, on the contrary, not evident that it is the continuously changing method of labor and division of labor which is constantly transforming social relations and property relations?</p>
<p>In 1789 the bourgeois did not tell feudal society that an aristocrat should remain an aristocrat, a serf a serf and a guildsman a guildsman -- because there is no society without labor and division of labor. There is no life without breathing of air. Hence, argues Montesquieu LVI, breathe the stuffy air and do not open any window.</p>
<p>One must possess the naively clumsy insolence of a German imperial philistine grown grey in crass ignorance to contribute oracular pronouncements upon problems on which our century is breaking its teeth, after having rammed the first elements of political economy -- labor and division of labor -- in a superficial and distorted manner his inert head.</p>
<p>"There is no society without labor and the division of labor.</p>
<p>"Hence
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Elect advocates of the imposed Prussian constitution, and only advocates of the imposed constitution, as delegates."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This epitaph will be inscribed in large letters on walls of the magnificent marble mausoleum which a grateful posterity will feel obliged to erect for Montesquieu LVI (not to be confused with Henry CCLXXXIV of Reuss-Schleiz-Greiz-Lobenstein-Eberswalde [An allusion to Henry LXXII, Prince of Reuss-Lobenstein-Ebersdorf. -- Ed.]) who solved the social question.</p>
<p>Montesquieu LVI does not conceal from us "where the difficulty lies" and what he intends to do as soon as he is proclaimed a lawgiver.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The state," he teaches, "must see to it that everybody receives sufficient education to be able to learn something useful in this world.'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Montesquieu LVI has never heard that under existing conditions the division of labor replaces complex labor by simple labor, the labor of adults by that of cbildren, the labor of men by that of women, the labor of the independent workers by automatons; that, with the development of modern industry, the education of workers becomes unnecessary and impossible. We refer the Montesquieu of Cologne neitber to Saint- Simon nor to Fourier but to Malthus and Ricardo. This worthy should first acquaint himself with the rudiments of present-day conditions before trying to improve them and making oracular utterances.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The community must take care of people who have bee reduced to poverty as a result of illness or old age."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if the community itself is reduced to poverty which will be the inevitable result of the 100-million tax and the recurrent imposition of martial law together with the new constitution?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When new inventions or commercial crises destroy entire industries the state must come to their assistance and find remedies."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though he may be little versed in the things of this world, it can hardly have escaped the Montesquieu of Cologne that "new inventions" and commercial crises are features just as permanent as Prussian ministerial decrees and legal basis. New inventions, especially in Germany, are only introduced when competition with other nations makes it vital to introduce them; and should the newly arising branches of industry be expected to ruin themselves in order to render assistance to the declining ones. The new industries that come into being as a result of inventions come into being precisely because they can produce more cheaply than the declining industries. What the deuce would be the advantage if they had to feed the declining industries? But it is well known that the state, the government, only seems to give. It has to be given first in order to give. But who should do the giving, Montesquieu LVI? The declining industry, so that it decline even faster? Or the rising industry, so that it wither on the stem? Or those industries that have not been affected by the new inventions, so that they go bankrupt because of the invention of a new tax? Think it over carefully, Montesquieu LVI!</p>
<p>And what about the commercial crises, my dear man? When a European commercial crisis occurs the Prussian state is above all anxious to extract the last drops, by means of distraint, etc., from the usual sources of revenue. Poor Prussian state! In order to neutralize the effect of commercial crises, the Prussian state would have to possess, in addition to national labor, a third source of income in Cloud- Cuckoo-Land. If royal New-Year's greetings, Wrangel's army orders or Manteuffel's ministerial decrees could indeed conjure up money, then the "refusal to Pay taxes" would not have caused such panic among the Prussian "trusty and well-beloved subjects", and the social question, too, would have been solved without an imposed constitution.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that the Neue Preussische Zeitung called our Hansemann a communist because he intended to do away with exemption from taxation. In Cologne our Montesquieu, who has never read the Neue Preussische Zeitung, has all by himself conceived the idea of calling everyone a "communist" and "red republican" who endangers the imposed constitution. Therefore, vote for Manteuffel, or you are not only personal enemies of labor and the division of labor, but also communists and red republicans. Acknowledge Bruggemann's latest "legal basis" or renounce the Code Civil.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> Figaro, tu n'aurais pas trouvé ça! More about Montesquieu LVI tomorrow.
</p>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="ME8-84-3"><i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> No. 202, January 22, 1849</h3><a id="Neue_Rheinische_Zeitung_No._202,_January_22,_1849"></a>
<p><i>Cologne</i>, January 21. With the sly petty cunning of an experienced <i>horse-dealer</i>, <i>Montesquieu LVI</i> seeks to sell the "gift horse", the imposed Constitution, to the primary electors. He is the Montesquieu of the horse-fair.</p>
<p>Anyone not wanting the imposed Constitution wants a republic, and not just a republic, but a red republic! Unfortunately, the issue in our elections is least of all a republic, or a red republic; it is simply this:</p>
<p>Do you want the old <i>absolutism</i> together with a refurbished <i>system of social estates</i>, or do you want a bourgeois <i>system of representation</i>? Do you want a political constitution in keeping with the "existing social relations" of past centuries, or do you want a political constitution in keeping with the "existing social relations" of your century?</p>
<p>In this case, therefore, it is least of all a question of fighting against bourgeois property relations similar to the struggle that is taking place in France and is being prepared in England; rather it is a question of a struggle against a political constitution which endangers "<i>bourgeois</i> property relations" by surrendering the helm of state to the representatives of "<i>feudal</i> property relations", to the King by the grace of God, the army, the bureaucracy, the country squires, and a few financial magnates and philistines who are allied with them.</p>
<p>Beyond a doubt, the imposed Constitution has solved the social question in keeping with the views of these gentlemen.</p>
<p>What is the "<i>social question</i>" as understood by the <i>government official</i>? It is the maintenance of his salary and his present position, which is superior to the people.</p>
<p>What is the "<i>social question</i>" as understood by the nobility and its big landowners? It is the maintenance of the hitherto existing feudal rights of the landowners, seizure of the most lucrative posts in the army and civil service by the families of the landed nobility, and finally direct alms from the public purse. Apart from these palpable <i>material</i> and therefore "<i>most sacred</i>" interests of the gentlemen "with God for King and Fatherland"<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> it is for them, of course, also a question of preserving those social privileges which distinguish their race from the inferior race of the bourgeois, peasants and plebeians. The old National Assembly was dispersed precisely because it dared to lay hands on these "most sacred interests". As we have already indicated, these gentlemen, by "revision" of the imposed Constitution, understand simply the introduction of a <i>system of social estates</i>, that is to say, a form of political constitution representing the "social" interests of the feudal aristocracy, the bureaucracy and the monarchy by the grace of God.</p>
<p>We repeat, there is not the slightest doubt that the imposed Constitution solves the "social question" in keeping with the views of the aristocracy and the bureaucracy, in other words, it presents these gentlemen with a form of government which ensures the exploitation of the people by these demigods.</p>
<p>But has the imposed Constitution solved the "social question" from the standpoint of the <i>bourgeoisie</i>? In other words, does the bourgeoisie receive a political system enabling if freely to administer the affairs of its class as a whole, i.e. the interests of commerce, industry and agriculture, to make the most productive use of public funds, to manage the state budget as cheaply as possible, to protect national labour effectively from without, and within the country to open up all sources of national wealth silted by feudal mud?</p>
<p>Does history provide a single example showing that under a king imposed by the grace of God, the bourgeoisie ever succeeded in achieving a political system in keeping with its material interests?</p>
<p>In order to establish a constitutional monarchy it was twice compelled to get rid of the Stuarts in Britain, and the hereditary Bourbons in France, and to expel William of Orange from Belgium.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>A hereditary king by the grace of God is not a particular individual but the physical representative of the old society within the new society. State power in the hands of a king by the grace of God is state power in the hands of the old society existing now merely as a ruin; it is state power in the hands of the feudal social estates, whose interests are profoundly antagonistic to those of the bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>But it is precisely the "<i>King by the grace of God</i>" who forms the basis of the imposed Constitution.</p>
<p>Just as the feudal strata of society regard the monarchy by the grace of God as their <i>political apex</i>, so does the monarchy by the grace of God regard the feudal estates as its <i>social foundation</i>, the well-known "<i>monarchical wall</i>".<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, whenever the interests of the feudal lords and of the army and bureaucracy controlled by them clash with the interests of the bourgeoisie, the monarchy by the grace of God will invariably be impelled to a coup d'état and a revolutionary or counter-revolutionary crisis will arise.</p>
<p>Why was the National Assembly dispersed? Only because it upheld the interests of the bourgeoisie against the interests of feudalism; because it wanted to abolish the feudal relations hampering agriculture, to subordinate the army and bureaucracy to trade and industry, to stop the squandering of public funds and abolish aristocratic and bureaucratic titles.</p>
<p>All these were questions <i>chiefly</i> and <i>directly</i> affecting the <i>interests of the bourgeoisie</i>.</p>
<p>Thus, <i>coups d'état</i> and <i>counter-revolutionary crises</i> are vital conditions for the monarchy by the grace of God, which the March and similar events compelled to humiliate itself and reluctantly to accept the semblance of a bourgeois monarchy.</p>
<p>Can <i>credit</i> ever revive again under a political system which inevitably culminates in coups d'état, counter-revolutionary crises and states of siege?</p>
<p>What a delusion!</p>
<p>Bourgeois industry <i>must</i> burst the fetters of absolutism and feudalism. A revolution against both only demonstrates that bourgeois industry has reached a level when it must either win an appropriate political system or perish.</p>
<p>The system of bureaucratic tutelage guaranteed by the imposed Constitution spells <i>death</i> for industry. It is sufficient to look at the Prussian administration of mines, the factory regulations etc. When an English manufacturer compares his costs of production with those of a Prussian manufacturer, he will always first of all note the time losses which the Prussian manufacturer incurs because he has to observe bureaucratic rules.</p>
<p>What sugar-refiner does not remember the Prussian trade agreement with the Netherlands in 1839?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> What Prussian factory owner does not blush at the memory of 1846, when the Prussian Government in deference to the Austrian Government banned exports to <i>Galicia</i> for a whole province, and when one bankruptcy after another occurred in Breslau the Prussian Government declared with astonishment that it had had no idea that there were such important exports to Galicia etc.!</p>
<p>Men of the same race are placed at the helm of state by the imposed Constitution, and this "gift" itself comes from the same men. Consequently, examine it twice.</p>
<p>The Galicia adventure draws our attention to another point.</p>
<p>At that time the counter-revolutionary Prussian Government in league with Austria and Russia sacrificed Silesian industry and Silesian trade.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> This manoeuvre will be constantly repeated. The banker of the Prussian-Austrian-Russian counter-revolution, from which the monarchy by the grace of God with its monarchical walls will always have to seek <i>outside</i> support, is <i>England</i>. The same <i>England</i> is German industry's most dangerous opponent. These two facts, we believe, speak for themselves.</p>
<p>At home, an industry fettered by bureaucracy and an agriculture</p>
<p>fettered by feudal privileges; abroad, a trade sold by the counter-revolution to England—such is the fate of Prussia's national wealth under the aegis of the imposed Constitution.</p>
<p>The report of the "Financial Commission" of the dispersed National Assembly has thrown sufficient light on the management of national wealth by the grace of God.</p>
<p>The report however mentions only by way of example the sums taken from the treasury to support the tottering monarchical walls and gild foreign pretenders to the absolute monarchy (Don Carlos). But these monies, purloined from the pockets of the rest of the citizens to enable the aristocracy to live in appropriate style and to keep the "buttresses" of the feudal monarchy in good condition, are only of secondary importance compared with the state budget imposed simultaneously with Manteuffel's Constitution. The main features of the imposed state budget are, first of all, a <i>strong army</i> to enable the minority to rule the majority; as large an army as possible of officials so that as many of them as possible, by virtue of their private interests, are alienated from the common interest; unproductive employment of public monies in order that wealth, as the <i>Neue Preussische Zeitung</i> says, should not make the <i>subjects</i> overbold; immobilisation wherever possible of public monies instead of employing them in industry in order that at easily predictable moments of crisis the Government by the grace of God should independently confront the people. The basic principle of the imposed Prussian Constitution is to use the taxes for maintaining the state power as an oppressive, independent and sacred force contraposed to industry, commerce and agriculture, instead of <i>degrading</i> it into a profane <i>tool</i> of bourgeois society.</p>
<p>The gift is worthy of the donor. The Constitution is of a piece with the present Prussian Government that presented it. To characterise <i>this Government's hostility towards the bourgeoisie</i> it is sufficient to point to its proposed <i>trade regulations</i>. On the pretext of <i>advancing towards association</i> the Government attempts to <i>return to the guild system</i>. Competition compels the manufacturer to produce more and more cheaply and therefore on a constantly increasing scale, i.e. with <i>more capital</i>, with a continuously <i>expanding division of labour</i> and constantly</p>
<p><i>increasing use of machinery</i>. Every new division of labour depreciates the traditional skill of the craftsmen, every new machine ousts hundreds of workers, production on a larger scale, that is with more capital, ruins small trade and petty-bourgeois enterprise. The Government promises to protect the handicrafts against the factories, acquired skills against division of labour, and small capital against big capital, by means of <i>feudal guild institutions</i>. Thus, the German nation, particularly the Prussian, which only with the utmost difficulty and effort resists complete defeat by English competition, is to become its defenceless prey, forced to accept a form of trade organisation that is incompatible with modern means of production and is already burst wide open by modern industry.</p>
<p>We are certainly the last people to desire the rule of the bourgeoisie. We were the first in Germany to raise our voice against the bourgeoisie when today's "men of action" were spending their time complacently in petty squabbles.</p>
<p>But we say to the workers and the petty bourgeois: it is better to suffer in modern bourgeois society, which by its industry creates the material means for the foundation of a new society that will liberate you all, than to revert to a bygone form of society, which, on the pretext of saving your classes, thrusts the entire nation back into medieval barbarism.</p>
<p>But medieval social estates and conditions are, as we have seen, the <i>social foundation</i> of the Government by the grace of God. This Government is unsuitable for modern bourgeois society. It necessarily tries to create a society in its own image. It is <i>entirely consistent</i> when it attempts to replace free competition by the guild system, mechanical spinning by the spinning-wheel and the steam plough by the hoe.</p>
<p>Why is it then that, under these circumstances, the Prussian bourgeoisie, in complete contrast to its French, English and Belgian predecessors, proclaims as its shibboleth the imposed Constitution (and with it the monarchy by the grace of God, the bureaucracy and the junkers)?</p>
<p>The commercial and industrial sections of the bourgeoisie throw themselves into the arms of the counter-revolution for fear of the revolution. As though counter-revolution were not the overture to revolution.</p>
<p>There is moreover a section of the <i>bourgeoisie</i> that, quite indifferent to the interests of its class as a whole, pursues its own particular interests, which may even be inimical to those of its class.</p>
<p>These are financial magnates, big creditors of the state, bankers, and rentiers, whose wealth increases proportionately to the poverty of the people, and finally men whose business depends on the old political structure, e.g. <i>Dumont</i> and his literary lumpenproletariat. These are ambitious professors, lawyers and similar persons, who can only hope to obtain respectable posts in a state where betrayal of the people's interests to the Government is a lucrative business.</p>
<p>These are individual manufacturers who do well out of their transactions with the Government; contractors whose considerable profits depend on the general exploitation of the people; philistines who lose their importance in political life on a large scale; local councillors who under cover of the old institutions arrange their private shady affairs at the expense of the public; oil merchants who by betrayal of the revolution have become Excellencies and Knights of the Eagle;<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> bankrupt cloth merchants and speculators in railway shares who have become royal bank directors<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> etc., etc.</p>
<p>"It is they who are the friends of the imposed Constitution." If the bourgeoisie has a <i>sympathetic heart for these poor brothers</i> and if it wants to be worthy of the respect of Montesquieu LVI, then it should elect
</p>
<p><i>delegates in keeping with the imposed Constitution.</i></p><div class="mw-references-wrap mw-references-columns"><ol class="references">

CHARLES LONGUET TO HUGO HELLER</p>
<p>IN OXFORD</p>
<p>[London,] 23 June 1873<br>
1 Maitland Park Road,<br>
Haverstock Hill</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p>May I thank you on both my own and my father-in-law's behalf for your kind suggestion; but at this moment we neither of us have anything of importance to convey to Paris. So if the French customs search your pockets or your baggage for petrol, they will be wasting their time.</p>
<p>Do not, however, let this deter you from coming to see us on Friday,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>if you have a moment to spare. In any case I very much hope we shall see you before your return to Oxford.</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge there has never been a General Clément in the Commune; I presume you must mean Citizen Clémence, the delegate of the 11th Arrondissement. He is not a general but a non-commissioned officer in the National Guard, and a tinsmith by trade.</p>
<p>With kindest regards,</p>
<p>Your devoted
Ch. Longuet

<p>This item was published in La Plebe in the section "The Latest News" and began with the words: "A member of the International writes us from London". The item, apparendy, is part of Engels' letter to the editor of the paper, Enrico Bignami, which is not extant.

<p>With regard to the Conference's resolution on politics,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I am pleased to announce that the Spanish federation has fully accepted it, as can be seen from the latest issues of the Emancipacion of Madrid and the Federation of Barcelona (December 3).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> The transformation of the International in Spain into a distinct and independent political party is now secure. We are doing wonderfully in Spain: from 19 to 20,000 new members in under three months! In Denmark the International has only been in existence for three months and it has 2,000 members in the capital alone, a smaller city than Milan. The peasants are joining in large numbers too, and a big campaign is being prepared for the forthcoming elections, which promise to give us a strong and respectable representation in the Danish Parliament.</p>
<p>We are doing well in Germany and Holland. In France we have 26 newspapers and the sections are re-forming behind M. Thiers' back.

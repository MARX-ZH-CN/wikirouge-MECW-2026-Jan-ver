<br>Dear Sir,
<br>We assume you are the author of the fine obituary of our late, dear friend W. Wolff, which appeared in the <em>Breslauer Zeitung.</em> My husband is anxious to write a detailed biography of him, but has no material whatever on the earlier phases of our friend's life. You would be doing him a great service if you could help him in this respect by passing on to him in as much detail as possible everything you know about Wolff, especially his childhood and the earlier part of his life. We have been on the closest terms with him ever since 1845. Hence what we are concerned with is rather the earliest period of his life. My husband, who has just recovered from a grave and very wearisome illness, has directed me to ask you, Sir, as an old and trusted friend of the deceased, to do us this kindness, and I hope that you will soon pass on to its everything you can call to mind about our dear, dear Wolff.
<br>With cordial regards from my husband and myself.
<br>Yours,<br>Jenny Marx,<br><em>née</em> von Westphalen

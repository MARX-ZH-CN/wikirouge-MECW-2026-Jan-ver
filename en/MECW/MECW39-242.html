<br><i>To Engels in Manchester</i>
<br><b>[London,] 2 September 1854, 28 Dean Street, Soho</b>
<br>Dear Frederic,
<br>So now you're a member of the Exchange, and <b>altogether respectable. My gratulations</b>. Some time I should like to hear you howling amidst that pack of wolves.
<br>Heise has written to Imandt, telling him that factory people — where I don't know (nor does he say whether they're workers or manufacturers) — have banded together to appoint him their <b>common instructor</b>, and that he can count on getting £2 a week. <em>Tant mieux pour lui</em> [so much the better for him].
<br>My wife — as I had good reason to fear before she left — <b>is rather in too interesting circumstances</b>, otherwise well.
<br>Cluss has written again at last. I enclose his letter.
<br>Has your old man arrived yet?
<br>It is probably time we said something in the <em>Tribune</em> about military events in Asia. I have made a bit of a howler. In one of my recent <b>letters</b> I declared the <b>news</b> of the total defeat of the Turks at Kars to be a Vienna <b>invention</b>. True, the telegraphic dispatch was wrong, but it was nevertheless based on fact.
<br><b>My principal study</b> is now <b>Spain</b>. So far I have swotted up, mainly from Spanish sources, the 1808-14 and the 1820-23 periods. Am now coming to the years 1834-43. The thing is not without complexity. It is rather more difficult to discover exactly the springs behind developments. At any rate I made a timely start with <em>Don Quixote.</em> The whole thing will amount to about 6 articles for the <em>Tribune</em>, if much condensed. At least it may be counted a step forward that <b>at this moment one's studies</b> are paid for.
<br>Unfortunately the Library is closed from 1-7 September. Apart from other advantages, it's the only cool place in London.
<br><em>Entre nous</em>, Dronke, for want of other 'intellectual' stimulus, is busily engaged in investigating 'Steffen' and, in his letters to Imandt, tears him to pieces in an attempt to render him politically 'suspect'. I had no difficulty in convincing Imandt of the total absurdity of Dronke's mischievous cavilling. <em>C'est absurde.</em> I consider that in Steffen our [party] has made a very good acquisition. He has character and education. His views on comparative geography, in which he has specialised, are quite original. Unfortunately a manuscript in which he elaborated his ideas on the subject was left behind in Cologne.
<br>What is Lupus doing? Miquel didn't come over from Paris as intended because, having had 2 attacks of cholera followed by a haemorrhage, he was finally ordered by the doctors to make his way back to Germany overland with all dispatch.
<br><em>Vale faveque.</em>
<br>K. M.

WILHELM LIEBKNECHT TO LUIGI STEFANONI<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>IN FLORENCE
<br>Leipzig, 29 February 1872
<br>Sir,
<br>I have just learnt that your paper has not only published repeated attacks on the International Working Men's Association, but that it has also (in Nos. 1 &amp; 4 of this year<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> ) translated and endorsed the filthy slanders of the police about the London General Council and Marx in particular, which appeared in the Berlin <i>Neuer Social-Demokrat.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <br>Since the publication of my previous letter to you, in the <i>Libero Pensiero</i> No. 3,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> was suited and perhaps designed to give the impression that I approve of this conduct, I hereby formally request you to inform your readers that I must repudiate any connection with men who aid and abet the European police in their persecution of the International and thus—whether con- sciously or unconsciously—play into the hands of Messrs Bismarck and Bonaparte.
<br>I may tell you furthermore that the regional congress in Chemnitz, to which I referred in the letter published by you, has unanimously come out in favour of the London General Coun- cil.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> In conclusion I would add that a copy of this letter is being sent to my friend and teacher, Karl Marx, for him to make whatever use of it he wishes.
<br>W. Liebknecht

Liebknecht sent the text to Engels, who translated it into Italian and forwarded it to Carlo Cafiero in Italy to be published in the press (a handwritten draft of the translation has survived which is identical to the version published in the <i>Gazzettino Rosa).</i> The <i>Gazzettino Rosa</i> dated the letter 29 February 1872</span>

It was attended by 120 delegates, among them Bebel and Liebknecht, representing nearly 60 local organisations. In closed session the congress considered its attitude to the Sonvillier circular (see Note 374) and the battle against the anarchists in the International. Having rejected the circular and approved the resolutions of the London Conference, the congress gave its unanimous support to the General Council.</span>

ENGELS TO MILLER &amp; RICHARD<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London, after 9 September 1871]</p>
<p>Gentlemen,</p>
<p>In reply to etc. I beg to say that I believe M. MD<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> to be well qualified as to character, talent, &amp; political position, for the undertaking he has in view. As a representative Irishman, he will be able, as far as I can judge, to command considerable support in more than one way among his countrymen; he has very extensive connections among them; and personally, I believe him to be strictly honourable.</p>
<p>Requesting you to make use of the above in strict confidence and without my guarantee, I am etc.

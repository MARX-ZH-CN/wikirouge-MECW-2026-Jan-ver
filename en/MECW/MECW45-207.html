MARX TO THOMAS ALLSOP</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 1 January 1878</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p>I hope one good thing the new year will do—act beneficently upon your health.</p>
<p>My best thanks for the Owen addresses and proclamations.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Trafalgar Square meeting of Friday last was much more important than the newspaper reports would make it appear.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>There was a gathering of at least 15,000-20,000 people. The Russian party, as represented by the Honourable Bradlaugh, Hales, Mottershead, Osborne, etc., was forced, after a tremendous hand to hand fight, to evacuate the place with torn dresses, swollen eyes and broken noses. A dozen wounded were delivered to the next hospital. John Bull came out as a true bull and not as a lamb. The Turkish party was in overwhelming majority. <i>Entre nous,</i> I had somewhat my hand in getting up this demonstration, as, in point of fact, I have since many, many months acted through some British workmen and <i>ci-devant</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>workmen upon the very diversified layers of the Pro-Turkishers. But, of course, if I had made the least public move, the whole thing would have been spoilt. In such <i>national</i> affairs no foreigner must appear. If he thinks it his duty to do something, he must do so <i>secretly,</i> behind the scenes, by a few natives upon whose discretion he can rely. One day I shall tell you [about] the very strange relations into which I have thus entered with British Grandees who would get into a white rage if they had the least suspicion under whose advice they were acting.</p>
<p>I have received letters and prints from Russia. The misery now prevailing there is truly shocking. Save the governmental dependents and the by no means strong fraction of Pan-Slavists, discontent is universal. They had hoped peace would be at once concluded after the fall of Plevna.</p>
<p>As to Turkey, the great danger for her is Mahmud Damad who alone is responsible for the failure of the first campaign. This fact is known at Constantinople, and I wonder whether some fanatical Softas<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>will not have the good sense to 'extinguish' that scoundrel. As Hobbes said: The equality of men is proved by this... that the smallest man, the weakest man, can in one way or other kill the tallest, the biggest one."<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Apart from all incidents of war, with the help of that model administration the Russians owe, the winter in Bulgaria will decimate their army. Already all their pontoon-bridges, save that of Zimnicea<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>(which also will <i>not stand</i> the repeated attacks of the Danube ice), are swept away, and, by the by, they will be cut off from Wallachia.</p>
<p>In France the Dufaure cabinet will not last long. The discovery of the military conspiracy will kill it.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The whole family send you their new year wishes and you know that they come from the heart.</p>
<p>Yours most devotedly,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

One of their basic demands was the convocation of a representative body to approve the state budget. The Sultan was forced to meet some of the softas' demands. Specifically, he dismissed the Grand Vizier (Prime Minister) and the Sheikh ul Islam (head of the Moslem clergy).</span>

The attempt by Mac-Mahon and his followers to effect a coup d'état on 13 December fell through due to the resistance of the junior officer corps and especially the body of privates, who shared the republican leanings of the French peasantry. On 14 December, Jules Dufaure's government was formed. In January 1879, Mac-Mahon was obliged to resign before his term of office had expired. Jules Grévy, a moderate republican, was elected president of the Republic. The bourgeois-republican system was definitively established in France.</span>

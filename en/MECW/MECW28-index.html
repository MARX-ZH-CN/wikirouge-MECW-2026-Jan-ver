<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-5" target=_blank>Capital  . Sum of values. –  Landed property and capital. – Capital comes from circulation. Content exchange value. – Merchant capital, money capital, and money interest. – Circulation presupposes another process. Motion between presupposed extremes</a></li>

<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-7" target=_blank>(1) Circulation, and exchange value deriving from circulation, the presupposition of capital</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-8" target=_blank>Exchange value emerging from circulation, a presupposition of circulation, preserving and multiplying itself in it by means of labour</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-9" target=_blank>Product and capital. Value and capital. Proudhon</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-10" target=_blank>Capital and labour. Exchange value and use value for exchange value. – Money and its use value (labour) in this relation, capital. Self-multiplication of value is its only movement. – The phrase that no capitalist will employ his capital without drawing a gain from it. – Capital, as regards substance, objectified labour. Its antithesis, living, productive (i.e. value-preserving and value-increasing) labour. – Productive labour and labour as performance of a service. – Productive and unproductive labour. A. Smith etc. – Thief in Lauderdale's sense and productive labour</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-11" target=_blank>The two different processes in the exchange of capital with labour. (Here the use value of that which is exchanged for capital belongs to the specific economic form etc.)</a></li>

<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-15" target=_blank>(  Labour power as  capital!) –  Wages not productive</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-16" target=_blank>The exchange between capital and labour belongs within simple circulation, does not enrich the worker. – Separation of labour and property the precondition of this exchange. – Labour as object absolute poverty, labour as subject general possibility of wealth. – Labour without particular specificity confronts capital</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-17" target=_blank>Labour process absorbed into capital. (Capital and capitalist)</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-18" target=_blank>Production process  as content of capital. Productive and unproductive labour (productive labour – that which produces capital). – The worker relates to his labour as exchange value, the capitalist as use value etc. – He divests himself  [entäussert sich]  of labour as the wealth-producing power. (Capital appropriates it as such.) Transformation of labour into capital etc. Sismondi, Cherbuliez, Say, Ricardo, Proudhon etc.</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-19" target=_blank>Realization process [  Verwertungsprozess  ]. –  (Costs of production.) – (Surplus value not explicable by exchange.  Ramsay. Ricardo.)  Capitalist cannot live from his wage etc.  (Faux frais de production.)    –  Mere self-preservation, non-multiplication of value contradicts the essence of capital</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-20" target=_blank>Capital enters the cost of production as capital.  Interest-bearing capital. Proudhon</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-21" target=_blank>Surplus value. Surplus labour time. – Bastiat on wages. Value of labour. How determined? – Self-realization is self-preservation of capital. Capitalist may not live merely from his labour etc. Conditions for the self-realization of capital. Surplus labour time etc. – To the extent that capital is productive (as creator of surplus labour etc.), this only historic-transitory. – The free blacks in Jamaica. – Wealth which has gained autonomy requires slave labour or wage labour (forced labour in both cases)</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-22" target=_blank>Surplus value.  Ricardo. Physiocrats. A. Smith. Ricardo</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-23" target=_blank>Surplus value and productive force. Relation when these increase. – Result. – Productive force of labour is productive force of capital. – In proportion as necessary labour is already diminished, the realization of capital becomes more difficult</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-24" target=_blank>Concerning increases in the value of capital</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-25" target=_blank>Labour does not  reproduce  the value of the material in which, and of the instrument with which, it works. It  preserves  their value simply by relating to them in the labour process as to their objective conditions. This animating and preserving force costs capital  nothing;  appears, rather, as its own force etc.</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-26" target=_blank>Absolute surplus labour time. Relative. – It is not the  quantity  of living labour, but rather its  quality  as labour which simultaneously preserves the labour time already contained in the material etc. – The change of form and substance in the direct production process. – The preservation of the previous stage of production by the subsequent one is contained in the simple production process etc. – Preservation of the old use value by new labour etc. – Process of production and process of realization. The  quantity  of objectified labour is preserved because contact with living labour preserves its quality as use value for new labour. – In the real production process, the separation of labour from its objective conditions of existence is suspended. But in this process labour already incorporated in capital etc. Appears as capital's power of self-preservation. Eternalization of value</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-27" target=_blank>Capitalist obtains surplus labour free of charge together with the maintenance of the value of material and instrument. Labour, by adding a new value to the old one, at the same time maintains, eternizes [sic] the latter. – The  preservation  of values in the product costs capital nothing. – By means of the appropriation of ongoing labour, the capitalist already possesses a claim to (and, respectively) appropriation of future labour</a></li>

<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-28" target=_blank>Notebook IV (Mid-December 1857 – 22 January, 1858)</a><ol>
<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-29" target=_blank>Confusion of profit and surplus value. Carey's erroneous calculation. – The capitalist, who does  not pay  the worker for the  preservation  of the old value, then demands remuneration for giving the worker permission to preserve the old capital. – Surplus value and profit etc. – Difference between consumption of the instrument and of wages. The former consumed in the production process, the latter outside it. – Increase of surplus value and decrease in rate of profit. (Bastiat)</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-30" target=_blank>Multiplication of simultaneous working days.  (Accumulation of capital.) –  Growth of the constant part of capital in relation to the variable part spent on wages = growth of the productivity of labour. – Proportion in which capital has to increase in order to employ the same number of workers if productivity rises</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-31" target=_blank>Percentage of total capital can express very different relations. – Capital (like property) rests on  productivity of labour</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-007.html#ME28-7-32" target=_blank>Increase of surplus labour time. Increase of simultaneous working days  (Population).  (Population can increase in proportion as  necessary labour time  becomes smaller, i.e. the time required to produce living labour capacities decreases.) – Surplus capital and surplus population. – Creation of free time for society</a></li>

<li><a href="MECW28-008.html#ME28-8-3" target=_blank>Transition from the process of the production of capital into the process of circulation. – Devaluation of capital itself owing to increase of productive forces. (Competition.)  (Capital  as unity and contradiction of production process and realization process.) Capital as barrier to production. – Overproduction. (Demand by the workers themselves.) – Barriers to capitalist production</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-008.html#ME28-8-4" target=_blank>Overproduction. – Proudhon (How is it possible that in the price of the commodity which the worker buys, he pays the profit etc. and still obtains his necessary wages). – Price of the commodity and labour time. Surplus etc. (  Price  and value etc.) – Capitalist does not sell  too dear;  but still above what the thing costs him. – Price (fractional). Bastiat. Decline of the fractional price. – Price can fall below value without damage to capital. Number and unit (measure) important in the multiplication of prices</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-008.html#ME28-8-5" target=_blank>Specific accumulation  of capital (transformation of surplus labour (revenue) into capital). – Proudhon. Value- and price- determination. In antiquity (slaves) not overproduction but over-consumption</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-008.html#ME28-8-6" target=_blank>The general rate of profit. – If the capitalist merely sells at  his own  cost of production, then it is a  transfer  to another capitalist. Worker gains almost nothing thereby</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-008.html#ME28-8-7" target=_blank>Barrier of capitalist production. – Relation of surplus labour to necessary labour. Proportion of the surplus consumed by capital to that transformed into capital. – Devaluation during crises</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-008.html#ME28-8-8" target=_blank>Capital coming out of the production process becomes money again</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-008.html#ME28-8-9" target=_blank>Surplus labour or surplus value becomes surplus capital. All determinants of capitalist production now appear as results of (wage) labour itself. The realization process  [Verwirklichungsprozess]  of labour at the same time its de-realization process  [Entwirklichungsprozess]</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-008.html#ME28-8-10" target=_blank>Formation of surplus capital I. – Surplus capital II. – Inversion of the law of appropriation. – Chief result of the production and realization process: the reproduction and new production of the relation of capital and labour itself, of capitalist and worker</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-008.html#ME28-8-11" target=_blank>Original accumulation of capital.  (The real accumulation). – Once developed historically, capital itself creates the conditions of its existence (not as conditions for its arising, but as results of its being). – (Performance of personal services, as opposed to wage labour.) – Inversion of the law of appropriation. Real alien relation  [Fremdheit]  of the worker to his product. Division of labour. Machinery etc.</a></li>

<li><a href="MECW28-008.html#ME28-8-15" target=_blank>Circulation of capital and circulation of money. – Presupposition of value within each single capital (instrument etc.). – Production process and circulation process moments of production. – The productivity of the different capitals (branches of industry) determines that of the individual capital. – Circulation period. Velocity of circulation substitutes for volume of capital. Mutual dependence of capitals in the velocity of their circulation. Circulation a moment of production. Production process and its duration. Transformation of the product into money. Duration of this operation. Retransformation of money into the conditions of production. Exchange of part of the capital with living labour. – Transport costs</a></li>

Propagandistic nature of capital. – Abbreviation of circulation (credit). – Storch. – What the capitalist advances is labour. (Malthus.) – Barriers to capitalist production. (Thompson)  </a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-008.html#ME28-8-19" target=_blank>Circulation and creation of value. (Equalization between different capitals in the conditions of circulation.) Capital not a source of value-creation. – Circulation costs. – Continuity of production presupposes suspension of circulation time</a></li>
<li><a href="MECW28-008.html#ME28-8-20" target=_blank>Ramsay. Circulation time. Concludes therefore that capital is its own source of profit. – Ramsay.

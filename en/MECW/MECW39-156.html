MARX TO JOSEPH WEYDEMEYER</p>
<p>IN NEW YORK</p>
<p>[London,] 26 April 1853 28 Dean Street, Soho Dear Weydemeyer,</p>
<p>On 21 April I received the anonymous scrawl set out <i>below</i>. An identical anonymous letter was sent to the democratic tavern- keepers, Schärttner and Göringer. <i>I have</i> <i>ASCERTAINED</i> <i>the</i> <i>facts</i> <i>contained</i> <i>therein</i>. I think you should publish the thing (you may name Schärttner and Göringer) along with a few introduc- tory remarks dated London. Messrs Stieber and Goldheim have come over here in order to <i>link</i> Kossuth's apocryphal gunpowder plot with the Berlin affair.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>From the following you will note to what extent the 'contrite' Hirsch continues to be 'A Victim of Moucharderie'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>Let us hope the blackguard doesn't succeed in finding fresh victims in Berlin. I think this business will prove his complete undoing in America. Cluss will have received what follows below at the same time as yourself. We were all very taken with your 2 articles in the <i>Reform</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>Only see to it that Kellner doesn't exploit you without a fitting <i>quid</i> <i>pro</i> <i>quo</i> in terms of political influence. Well, here is a <i>word-for-word</i> copy of the letter received by Schärttner, etc.:</p>
<p>'London, 21.4.53</p>
<p>Announcement</p>
<p>Recent arrivals: Police Commissioner Stieber and the Jew Goldheim, a police lieutenant, both of Berlin.</p>
<p><i>Description</i></p>
<p><i>Stieber</i> <i>the</i> <i>Jew</i> <i>Goldheim</i> Medium height (about 5') about 6' Hair: black, short black, short Moustache: ditto, ditto ditto, ditto Complexion: sallow and muddy sallow, puffy features Wears dark, narrow trousers, a blue Wears black trousers, a light yellow sack,</p>
<p>sack, a collapsible stuff hat, and black hat. spectacles.</p>
<p>N.B. Both of them regularly go about together and are accompanied by <i>Hirsch</i>, a commercial assistant from Hamburg, and <i>Haering</i>, a one-time postal clerk from Willich's birth-place. Today Stieber and Goldheim had a meeting with Bangya. Stieber or Goldheim visit the Prussian Embassy regularly every day between 11 and 3.'</p>
<p>Today's <i>Times</i> reports the presence here of Stieber and Goldheim.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many regards to you and your wife.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>As that fire-eater Heinzen has again had the audacity in his <i>Volk</i> to invoke the 'Chartists'—who simply want universal suffrage without having to bother their heads over communists or odious class distinctions, I think it high time you published in the <i>Reform</i> the letter written to you by Ernest Jones.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>

It described the condition of various classes of English society and analysed the development of class struggle in England. Judging by Weydemeyer's letter to Marx of 24 May 1853, the letter was published in the American democratic papers at the end of 1852 or beginning of 1853</span>

<p>Dear Kugelmann</p>
<p>I have received everything: your letters (including some friendly notes from your dear wife and Fränzchen), the 'Meyer'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> (police-socialist, <i>faiseur</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> literary scribbler), the cuttings from the <i>Frankfurter</i>, etc, and finally a letter from Madame Tenge.</p>
<p>I am very grateful for your, your family's and Madame Tenge's friendly interest in my progress. But you do me an injustice if you ascribe my failure to write to any other cause than an uncertain state of health, which continually interrupts my work, then goads me on to make up for the time lost by neglecting all other duties (letters included), and finally puts a man out of humour and makes him disinclined for activity.</p>
<p>After my return from Harrogate I had an attack of carbuncles, then my headaches returned, insomnia, etc, so that I had to spend from the middle of April to 5 May at Ramsgate (seaside). Since then I have been feeling much better, but am far from being quite well. My specialist (Dr Gumpert<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> of Manchester) insists upon my going to Karlsbad and would like to make me travel there as soon as possible, but I must finally complete the French translation which has come to a full stop, and, apart from that, I should much prefer it if I could meet you there.</p>
<p>In the meantime, while I was unable to write, I worked through a lot of important new material for the second volume. But I cannot start on its final working out until the French edition is completed and my health fully restored.</p>
<p>So I have by no means yet decided how I shall spend the summer.</p>
<p>The progress of the German labour movement (ditto in Austria) is wholly satisfactory. In France the absence of a theoretical foundation and of practical common sense is very evident. In England at the moment only the rural labour movement shows any advance; the industrial workers have first of all to get rid of their present leaders. When I denounced them at the Hague Congress I knew that I was letting myself in for unpopularity, slander, etc, but such consequences have always been a matter of indifference to me. Here and there people are beginning to see that in making that denunciation I was only doing my duty.</p>
<p>In the United States our Party has to fight against great difficulties, partly economic, partly political, but it is making headway. The greatest obstacle there is the professional politicians, who immediately try to falsify every new movement and change it into a new 'company-promoting business'.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all diplomatic moves, a new war is inevitable <i>au peu plus tôt</i>, <i>au peu plus tard</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> and before the ending of this there will hardly be violent popular movements anywhere, or, at the most, they will remain local and unimportant.</p>
<p>The visit of the Russian emperor is giving the London police a great deal to do and the government here will be glad to get rid of the man as soon as possible. As a precautionary measure they requisitioned forty police (mouchards), with the notorious police commissioner Plocke at their head (Ali Baba and the forty thieves), from the French government, to watch the Poles and Russians here (during the tsar's stay). The so-called amnesty petition of the London Poles is the work of the Russian embassy; in answer to it the Poles here issued an appeal, written and signed by Wróblewski,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> which is addressed to the English and which has been distributed in large numbers at the Sunday meetings in Hyde Park. The English press (with very few exceptions) is obsequious – the tsar is after all 'our guest' – but for all that the real feeling against Russia is incomparably more hostile than it has been since the Crimean War, and the entry of a Russian princess into the royal family<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> has aroused rather than disarmed suspicion. The facts – the arbitrary abrogation of the decisions concerning the Black Sea in the Paris Treaty, the conquests and trickeries in Central Asia, etc, irritate John Bull, and Disraeli has no chance of remaining at the helm for any length of time if he continues Gladstone's unctuous foreign policy.</p>
<p>With my warmest greetings to your dear family and Madame Tenge.</p>
<p>Yours<br><b>KM</b>

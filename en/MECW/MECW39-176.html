ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester,] Wednesday, 24 August 1853</p>
<p>Dear Marx,</p>
<p>I'll send some money tomorrow if I <i>possibly can</i>. Your letter arrived on Saturday too late for anything to be done, this week there have been all sorts of complications, but tomorrow things will, I think, have improved, and our old bookkeeper has been forewarned.</p>
<p>The little man<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>was here on Saturday. That he had been gossiping was evident to me from the moment he wrote to Borchardt. He had sent him Lupus' most <i>discreditable</i> letter in which the latter makes an outright and most earnest appeal to the 'generosity' of the Jews in Bradford. <i>C'était une lettre à brûler de suite</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>; Borchardt at once magnanimously sent Lupus alms, to wit the sum of <i>one pound</i>,—not that he wasn't very decent about it, WHICH HE COULD WELL AFFORD to be, seeing that it released him from all his obligations. I must confess that this letter of Lupus' left a <i>very bad</i> taste in my mouth, but not so bad as the little man's tactlessness in letting it fall into Borchardt's clutches. Anyway I duly hauled him over the coals for it.</p>
<p><i>Enfin c'est fait</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>If Lupus is going to Liverpool, see to it that he comes here first, if possible on a Friday, in which case I shall arrange a rendez-vous with the little man. If, as Dronke proposes, Lupus first goes to Bradford, the <i>cancan</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>will only proliferate.</p>
<p>You know that Jacobi intends to go to America. The chap's altogether <i>trop mou</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>and even philistines get the impression that he's a helpless sort of creature. I don't believe he'll ever obtain a practice, however much he may pine for one. Besides one can't help laughing when one remembers that the chap's still a virgin.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

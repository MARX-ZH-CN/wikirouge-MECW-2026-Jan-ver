<blockquote>
<br>The <i>agreement debates</i> (<i>Vereinbarungsdebatten</i>) was the name given by Marx and Engels to the debates in the Prussian National Assembly, which met in Berlin in May 1848 to draft a Constitution "by agreement with the Crown" according to the formula proposed by the Hansemann-Camphausen Government. Marx and Engels labelled the Berlin Assembly, which adopted this formula and thereby rejected the principle of popular sovereignty, the "Agreement Assembly" and its deputies "the agreers".

</blockquote><br><em>Cologne,</em> June 17. We told you a few days ago: you deny the existence of the revolution. It will prove its existence by a second revolution.
<br>The events of June 14 are merely the first harbinger of this second revolution and already the Camphausen Government is in full dissolution. By placing itself under the protection of the people of Berlin, the Agreement Assembly has decreed a vote of confidence in them. <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> This act is a belated recognition of the March fighters. The Assembly has taken out of the hands of the Ministers the task of drawing up a Constitution and is seeking "agreement" with the people by appointing a committee which will examine all petitions and resolutions relating to the Constitution. This is a belated annulment of its declaration of incompetence. The Assembly promises to begin its constitutional work by a deed: the abolition of the very basis of the old system, namely of the feudal obligations with which the land is burdened. This promises to become another night of August 4.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>In a word: on June 15 the Agreement Assembly repudiated its own past just as on June 9 it had repudiated the people's past. It has experienced its March 21.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <br><em>The Bastille, however, has not yet been stormed.</em>
<br>But from the East an apostle of revolution is approaching impetuously and irresistibly. He is already standing at the gates of Thorn. It is the <em>Tsar</em>. <em>The Tsar will save the German revolution by centralising it</em>.

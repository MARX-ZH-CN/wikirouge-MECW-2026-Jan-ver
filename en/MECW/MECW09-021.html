<p>Today there is no news from the theatre of war, except for the Magyar report of the <em>Breslauer Zeitung.</em> It shows that the Austrians were indeed decisively defeated in the battle of Szolnok and forced to retreat towards Pest. Kecskemét is said to be again occupied by the Magyars, The Serezhan Colonel Albert Jellacic, Major Prince Holstein and even the royal imperial General Ottinger are said to have been killed.</p>
<p>The Magyar report claims that Stuhlweissenburg (on the right bank of the Danube, towards Vienna) is occupied by Magyars, and that in consequence of the Magyars' latest advances Prince Lobkowitz has gone to Debreczin to offer them <em>mediation proposals. More details tomorrow.</em>

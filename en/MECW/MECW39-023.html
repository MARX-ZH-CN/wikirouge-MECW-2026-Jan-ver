ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>Manchester, 19 February 1852
<br>Dear Marx,
<br>Despite tremendous efforts—your letter only arrived this morning—I have still not finished the article for Dana<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and it is now 11 o'clock at night. I have received the Bauer<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> —it is coming in very useful. In return, and whatever happens, you will receive 2 articles for Dana for next Tuesday's STEAMER. Since your letters reach Weydemeyer and mine don't, I'd be glad if you would forthwith dispatch the enclosed note to W.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> in one of your own. It's an altogether curious business. It seems that two or three of my letters to my old man have also failed to reach him. <i>Cela n'est pas clair</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> <br>Tell Jones he will be getting something from me next week, or write him a note to that effect. God knows why so many snags should crop up all at once and prevent me from getting down to anything. But on Saturday and Sunday I shall shut myself away, and then I hope to get something done.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> <br>Why doesn't that accursed Weydemeyer enclose Simon's article<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> so that we can attend to it ourselves? A stinging counter-article would soon show Dana that nothing is to be gained by accepting articles that attack us.
<br>Your
<br>F. E. 
<br>Write some time giving me the exact address under which <i>you</i> have written to Weydemeyer.

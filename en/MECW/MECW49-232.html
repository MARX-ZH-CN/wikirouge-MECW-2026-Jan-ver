ENGELS TO STANISLAW MENDELSON</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 4 July 1892</p>
<p>122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Citizen,</p>
<p>I have this minute received a letter from Bebel with a communication for you, which I am sending on at once.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I trust you will receive the money through the Deutsche Bank (which has, I believe, a branch here in London) and that you will be able to decipher Bebel's writing. If not, perhaps you might care to return me the letter so that I can transcribe it into characters of a more international nature.</p>
<p>My compliments, as also those of Mrs Kautsky, to Mrs Mendelson.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>F. Engels</p>
<p>Bebel was not immediately able to lay his hands on your address, which is why he sent the bank's statement of sale to me.

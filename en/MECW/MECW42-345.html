ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 29 March 1868</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>I am afraid I shall not finish the article for the <i>Fortnightly</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>by Tuesday. The damned Schiller Institute business<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>kept me breathless all the week, until I finally got things cleared up yesterday. If I had failed—and several stupidities on the part of my main adjutant put everything doubtful again—I would have been terribly discredited, made ludicrous for the whole of Manchester; TO BE DONE' IN BUSINESS, TO GET YOURSELF SOLD' is naturally here the worst thing that can happen to you. Now it is a great triumph and gives me the opportunity I wanted to withdraw with honour from official participation in the affair; anyway now enough people will be pushing themselves forward for it. I am doubly annoyed because this business has made it impossible for me to complete the article; but for this I would have had to rush it, and in this case the quality is very important.</p>
<p>Schorlemmer has made a very fine discovery: <i>the law of the boiling points</i> of the hydrocarbons of the series CnH2n+2, i.e. for three of the four isomeric series; of the 4th, too few have yet been described.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>I shall be arriving at your place on Wednesday evening at 9, possibly earlier.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Where on earth can the enclosed article come from? And a letter of Bismarck's to cheer you up.</p>
<p>Best greetings.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p>I can find nothing about <i>Wiffa.</i> But in <i>higid, hiwisc, hida</i> you are confusing 2 if not 3 different words.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Anglo-Saxon <i>hiwisce,</i> Old Saxon and Old High German <i>hiwiski,</i> Old Frisian <i>hiskthe,</i> Old Nordic <i>hyski,</i> New North Frisian <i>hiske</i> = <i>familia.</i></p>
<p><i>Higid</i> can be the participle of the Anglo-Saxon <i>hegjan,</i> this verb means TO FENCE IN.</p>
<p>Whether <i>hide,</i> which is still encountered locally today as a measure of land, is drawn from this, or is connected with <i>hide cutis,</i> Anglo-Saxon <i>hyde,</i> I cannot determine without an Anglo-Saxon dictionary.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Engels wrote the review of Volume One of Marx's<i> Capital</i> for<i> The Fortnightly Review</i> much later, in May and June 1868. As can be seen from their subsequent correspondence, Marx and Engels exchanged opinions several times on the content and form of the article. In spite of Professor Beesly's request, the review was rejected by the editorial board and has only been preserved in manuscript form (see present edition, Vol. 20).</span>

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The<i> Schiller Institute,</i> founded in Manchester in November 1859 in connection with the centenary of Friedrich Schiller's birth, strove to be a German emigre cultural and social centre. Engels was critical of the Institute, noted for its tendency to formalism and pedantry, and he initially kept aloof from it. But when certain changes were introduced into its Rules, he became a member of its Directorate in 1864. Later, as the President of the Institute, Engels devoted much time to it and exercised a considerable influence on its activities. In September 1868, while Engels was away from Manchester, the Institute invited Karl Vogt, who was connected with the Bonapartists and was slandering the proletarian revolutionaries, to deliver a lecture. Engels felt that his political reputation would be compromised if he remained President and so he left the Directorate. In April 1870 he was again elected a member of the Directorate of the Schiller Institute, but did not take an active part in it.</span>

MARX TO WILLIAM RILEY</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 23 December 1872</p>
<p>Dear Riley,</p>
<p>When Hales sends his reply, the best thing will be to communicate it at once to me so that his letter and our reply may appear together in the same number.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> At the same time, you would then do well, to state in an editorial remark that after the things that have happened, especially his postcard, the columns of the <i>Herald</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> will no longer be open to him.</p>
<p>Yours fraternally</p>
<p>Karl Marx

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The reference is to the reply by John Hales to Marx's and Engels' letter of 20 December 1872 to the editor of <i>The International Herald,</i> which exposed the divisive activities of the reformist wing of the British Federal Council. Hales' reply written on 30 December was published in <i>The International Herald,</i> No. 40, 4 January 1873. 'Our reply' is a reference to the 'Address of the British Federal Council to the Sections, Branches, Affiliated Societies and Members' adopted at the Federal Council meeting of 23 December (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 309-14). It was written by Marx and distributed as a leaflet signed by ten Council members in response to the reformist circular of 10 December.</span>

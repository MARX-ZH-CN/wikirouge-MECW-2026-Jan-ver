MARX TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE</p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>London, 14 November 1879<br>41 Maitland Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Sorge,</p>
<p>I am at last able to send you all the powers of attorney.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I didn't get the others until the end of the week before last; they arrived when <i>I was confined to the house</i> by a most INFAMOUS cold and then, after that, my worthy SOLICITOR contrived to spin out the affair for another week, and only today did I finally receive <i>my</i> power of attorney. The account both for these and the first one will be sent to you later. The other 3 (or rather 4) powers of attorney will go off to you at the same time as this letter—but under separate cover.</p>
<p>You will doubtless have got my letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> in which I told you about the latest goings-on in the bosom of the party. Since then Höchberg and his associates<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> in Zurich have been <i>removed,</i> at least nominally, from the editorial committee which now sits in Leipzig, while Vollmar functions as editor in Zurich. His paper, <i>Der Sozialdemokrat,</i> isn't worth much. But at any rate all our associates worth mentioning, Liebknecht, Bebel, Bracke, etc., have disowned Dr Höchberg's, alias Richter's, <i>Jahrbuch,</i> though as yet only—in private.</p>
<p>You will have seen in the papers that the anti-communist gang, composed of very heterogeneous elements, was finally defeated at the Marseilles Congress.</p>
<p>My wife is still dangerously ill and I myself am not yet completely fit.</p>
<p>With kindest regards from my family.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Karl Marx

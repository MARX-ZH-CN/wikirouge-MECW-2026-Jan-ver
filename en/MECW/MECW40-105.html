<p><i>To Engels in Manchester</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 13 November 1857</b></p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>A week ago on Thursday I waited at both the appointed places — which, however, was one too many — from 11 o'clock to 3. Then I gave the whole thing up <b>in despair.</b></p>
<p>I can write no more than a line or two, the article having left me only a few minutes until posting time. Let me know definitely when I can have 'Cannon'. It's a matter of getting the goods off to America at what is (for me) a crucial moment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I haven't written a word about India. I have got to have some accurate military stuff on the subject, <b>events</b> having to some extent discredited myself and the <em>Tribune</em>. [referring to Marx's estimation that a British storming of Delhi could not succeed]</p>
<p>Though my own <b>financial distress</b> may be dire indeed, never, since 1849, have I felt <b>so cosy</b> as during this <b>outbreak</b>. Furthermore you can set Lupus' mind at rest by telling him that, <b>now that the whole statement is before us</b>, I have written an exhaustive <b>article</b> for the <em>Tribune</em> in which I show, if only on the basis of the table of <b>discount-rates</b> for 1848-54, that the crisis ought by rights to have set in 2 years earlier. Moreover the <b>delays</b> are now explicable in such rational terms that even Hegel might, to his great <b>satisfaction</b>, have rediscovered the 'concept' in the 'empirical diversity of the world of finite interests'.</p>
<p><em>Salut</em>.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.</p>
<p>Go on sending me, as you started to do, as many Manchester papers as possible. Not only for the <em>Tribune</em>. I am thinking of writing about the crisis for the benefit of the fatherland.

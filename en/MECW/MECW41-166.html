MARX TO CARL SIEBEL</p>
<p>IN BARMEN</p>
<p>[Berlin,] 2 April 1861</p>
<p>Dear Siebel,</p>
<p>A letter, which arrived from Amsterdam today, brought the pleasant tidings that I shall be able to SETTLE my chief financial difficulties (which run to hundreds of pounds), since my uncle<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> (who looks after my mother's affairs) has declared himself agreeable so far as the main issue is concerned. I am thus rid of my <i>chief worry,</i> but as regards the <i>secondary matter</i> I wrote to you about,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I shall have to rely on you.</p>
<p>I am bored stiff here. I am treated as a kind of <i>LION</i> and am forced to see <i>a great many</i> professional 'wits', both male and female. <i>C'est affreux.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> What is keeping me here <i>(not for more than another week,</i> I hope) is the circumstance that I refuse to leave until I have forced the Prussian government to recognise my REINIEGRA-TION. <i>Prima facie</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> they are not making any difficulties about it, but are trying to shelve it.</p>
<p>I shall be spending only one day in Elberfeld. Kindly write and tell me <i>by return,</i> how <i>quickly</i> one can get from Elberfeld to Aachen where I have an appointment.</p>
<p>For Part II of my political economy,<sup>8</sup> I have dismissed Duncker in favour of Brockhaus. (Not that the latter knows this yet, but I have a sure means of forcing his hand.)</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

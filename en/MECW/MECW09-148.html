<br>Cologne, March 20. Yesterday evening a banquet was held in Gürzenich to mark the anniversary of last year's barricade batdes in Berlin. Whereas even at the bourgeois concert of March 18 "to celebrate the promise" of a Constitution etc. etc., the biggest hall of our city was fairly well filled, yesterday there was not room enough to hold half the public streaming towards it. While 5,000-6,000 persons stood crowded in the hall side by side, several thousand more tried in vain to get in. The hall had filled so rapidly that even a number of speakers succeeded only after 9 o'clock in forcing their way through.
<br>Karl Schapper was in the chair and opened the meeting with a toast to the sovereign people, the sole source of all legal power. Further toasts were drunk as follows: H. Becker, to the memory of those who died on March 18 and 19; Citizen Wächter, to the improvement of the German Michel; Citizen Weyli. to the complete revolution, not an incomplete one; Citizen Ritlinghausen: to the downfall of the German Emperor; C. Cramer, to the democratic women present at our banquet; W. Wolff, editor of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung: to the Jiaiiati republics; E. Dronke, editor of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, to the proletarian revolution; P. Nothjung. to the victory of the Magyars and Kossuth; H. Bürgers, editor of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, to the eve» throw of Austria. F. Wolff, editor of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung. to the accused on triai in Bourges<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> ; F. Engels, editor of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, to the June insurgents in Paris; K. Schapper. to the English Chartists and their revolutionary leaders, Ernest Jones and G. J. Harney; Carl Cramer: to the Poles; Chr. Esser, editor of the Arbeiter-Zeitung<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> : to the Red Republic.
<br>The banquet, which went off entirely peacefully and orderly, concluded at about 11 p.m. with unanimous cheers for the Red Republic. In contrast to the concert held by the wailers,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> in Gürzenich on March 18, we are glad to note that never before has there been a festival in Cologne which has brought together such a numerous and at the same time so judicious a public as that at the banquet held yesterday evening under the auspices of the red flag.

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE</p>
<p>[London, 21 May 1890]</p>
<p>[...] witnessed this awakening, he who, on this self-same English soil, was alive to the minutest symptom! You people can have no conception of the pleasure I have experienced during the past fortnight. And things are coming thick and fast. First Germany in February, then the First of May there and in America, and now this Sunday when, for the first time in 40 years, the voice of the English proletariat rang out once again. I carried my head a couple of inches higher as I climbed down from the old goods waggon.</p>
<p>Regards to your wife* and Singer,</p>

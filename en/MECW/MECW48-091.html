ENGELS TO HERMANN SCHLÜTER
<br>IN HOTTINGEN-ZURICH
<br>London, 12 February 1888
<br>Dear Mr Schlüter,
<br>Unfortunately I shall not be able to send the ms.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I promised you by the 20th of this month, the reason being interruptions of all kinds, the arrival next week of the proofs of the <i>Manifesto</i> and the special care I am having to take of my eyes just now, while under treatment.
<br>Would you let me know as exactly as possible when printing ought to begin? The 3 chapters of the original <i>Theory of Force</i> are ready for the press but the new section is not quite finished yet in the first draft; I am not at all satisfied with the latter and, as usual, it is turning out longer than I had intended. Moreover, the theme is such that it must be dealt with powerfully or not at all.
<br>As soon as you give me a definite date I can let you know whether or not I shall be able to manage it by then. If not, it might be best if you could print something shorter in the meantime, for it will be a question or 3 or 4 weeks at most.
<br>Whether the ms. is suitable for publication in the <i>Sozialdemokrat</i> is something that had better be decided on the spot when it arrives.
<br>In any case, having regard to the present critical political situation, a certain amount of delay—to see how things turn out—would seem to me almost mandatory.
<br>With kindest regards,
<br>Yours,
<br>F. Engels

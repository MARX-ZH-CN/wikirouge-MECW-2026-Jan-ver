<h4 class="mw-headline" id="ME2-26-2">Fragment</h4>
<p>You proud pile in the ocean's solitude,</p>
<p>Grim rock-tomb of a heart as strong as stone</p>
<p>That here on self-made history came to brood</p>
<p>And in Promethean agony died alone —</p>
<p>Black-cowled, you loom above the ocean's flood,</p>
<p>Of all his many burnt-out candles, one</p>
<p>That God, in need of more illumination,</p>
<p>Kindled to light the work of his creation.</p>
<p><br>
Well might they send the Hero to this place,</p>
<p>Who at the hour of the century's birth</p>
<p>Lit with his firebolts history's darkling face</p>
<p>And with his thunder filled all ears on earth,</p>
<p>Until within the walls of cosmic space</p>
<p>The babe's first cry was lost as it burst forth;</p>
<p>Then Time threw coldly down in cruel jest</p>
<p>Another burnt-out stump to join the rest.</p>
<p><br>
Friedrich Oswald

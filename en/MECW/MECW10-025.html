<p>Sir, — In your number of Friday last we perceive, among the police reports, an account of an interview of Messrs. Fothergill, Struve, and others, at the Mansion-house, with Mr. Alderman Gibbs, on behalf of the German refugees. We beg to declare that neither any of the members of the undersigned committee, nor any of the German refugees supported by that committee, have had any connexion with this affair.</p>
<p>We request you, Sir, to publish this declaration in your next, as, in the interest of our nationality, we must protest against the numerous German refugees residing in London being made responsible for a step taken by some of them upon their own authority.</p>
<p>We are, Sir, your most obedient servants<br>The Democratic Socialist Committee for German Political Refugees —</p>
<p>Ch. Marx<br>Ch. Pfaender<br>F. Engels<br>H. Bauer<br>A. Willich</p>
<p>20 Great Windmill Street, Haymarket,<br>May 27, 1850

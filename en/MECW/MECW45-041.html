MARX TO ENGELS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London, February-March 1875]</p>
<p>Go to it, but in jovial fashion. So stupid, that Bakunin may have <i>contributed.</i> What Peter Tkachov is above all trying to tell his readers is that you had treated <i>him</i> as an enemy, and he therefore invents all manner of disputes that never occurred.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Marx wrote this letter on the cover of Tkachov's pamphlet <i>Offener Brief an Herrn Friedrich Engels,</i> Zurich, 1874. Tkachov's work was written in reply to Engels' third article in the <i>Refugee Literature</i> series carried by <i>Der Volksstaat</i> on 6 and 8 October 1874 (see present edition, Vol. 24, pp. 19-28). In his letter to Engels of 1 February 1875 Wilhelm Liebknecht proposed that Engels write a refutation to the pamphlet. Marx may have read the pamphlet in February or March and passed it on to Engels with his comments. A short while later, Engels wrote articles IV and V in the <i>Refugee Literature</i> series, which were printed by <i>Der Volksstaat</i> on 28 March and 2, 16, 18 and 21 April 1875.
This letter was published in English for the first time in: Marx and Engels, <i>Collected Works</i> (present edition, Vol. 24, Note 44).</span>

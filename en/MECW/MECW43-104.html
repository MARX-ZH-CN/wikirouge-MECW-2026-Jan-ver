ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 4 November 1868</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>You must excuse me if I do not write much now. For some time I have had nasty rheumatism not only in my right arm, but also in the 3 first fingers of my right hand; as a result, after a certain time writing becomes very burdensome for me, and in the evening almost impossible. I hope the trouble disappears; I use alcohol against it—externally that is.</p>
<p>If the Spaniards even now do not know where they stand, following Wilhelmchen's address, they are beyond hope. Unity between bourgeois and worker—the bourgeois <i>must,</i> however, realise that he has to concede this and that to the worker—anything to avoid a June battle, for this is followed by 2 December. It is really the crowning point of all confusion. If now the bourgeois will not 'understand', the worker will have to realise that <i>he</i> will have to make concessions to the bourgeois. This is the sole possible sense which the thing can have. Hence, the ridiculousness of measuring Spanish conditions, with the enormous beggar-proletariat, both clerical and lay, against the yardstick of conditions in <i>Saxony.</i> There is naturally not a single mention of the peasants. Many greetings.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p>Moore tells me that nearly all factory workers in Vienna are Moravians and Bohemians, mainly <i>Czechs.</i> This explains much about the movement there. The real Viennese do not go into factories, they become coachmen, domestics or something like that.

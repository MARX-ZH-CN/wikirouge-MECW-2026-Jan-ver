<blockquote><p>Part of this petition was published as a footnote in the book Rheinische Briefe und Akten zur Geschichte der politischen Bewegung 1830-1850, Essen, 1919, Bd. 1, S. 448</p></blockquote><p>Most excellent, most powerful King,</p>
<p>Most gracious King and Lord,</p>
<p>The High Royal Ministries in charge of censorship have ordered, by a rescript of January 21 of this year, the closure as from April 1 of the <i>Rheinische Zeitung</i>, published here in Cologne, and thereby threatened with ruin a concern which was founded by the undersigned, not without a considerable financial sacrifice, in order first of all to meet an urgent need of their native city, but was also meant, with Your Majesty's protection and trusting in Your Royal Majesty's noble-minded intentions, to act as a free and independent mouthpiece of public opinion fearlessly and unselfishly for the honour and interests of the Fatherland.</p>
<p>The undersigned believe that they have proved in a memorandum, which they lay in the most profound submission on the steps of Your Majesty's throne, that this decision of the high censorship authorities is impaired not only by a formal defect, but also that it is contrary both to the spirit of all previous legislation pertaining to the press and to Your Majesty's lofty intentions.</p>
<p>In order to meet the desires of the high censorship authorities, Your most humble subjects, the undersigned, will use the influence accorded to them by the stipulations of the Statute which they humbly enclose to ensure that the tone of the newspaper is moderate and dignified and that every possible offence is avoided, and therefore they all the more confidently express the following most respectful request:</p>
<p>May it please Your Royal Majesty, by rescinding the ministerial rescript issued by the High Ministries in charge of censorship on January 21 of this year, to order the unhindered continuance of the Rheinische Zeitung.</p>
<p>We remain most humbly Your Majesty's loyal subjects, the shareholders of the Rheinische Zeitung Company.</p>
<p>Cologne</p>

ENGELS TO FERDINAND LASSALLE</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 23 July 1862</p>
<p>Dear Lassalle,</p>
<p>I should have written to you long since and thanked you for the many packages you have been kind enough to send me. I resolved to do so often enough over the past 18 months, but have been so taken up with <i>doux commerce</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> that my private correspondence with all and sundry is badly in arrears. Now I hear you are in London and I would have liked to have come down last Saturday, but simply could not get away. I presently cherish a similar plan in respect of Friday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> evening, but cannot yet say for certain whether I shall be able to carry it out. If at all possible, it shall be done, in which case I shall telegraph Marx at midday on Friday. But if it proves impossible, why shouldn't you come up here on Friday evening or Saturday morning and spend a few days taking a look at the home of cotton? Then we could also slip over to Liverpool which is well worth the trouble, especially since you are concerning yourself with political economy. There's a room in my lodgings at your disposal. It only takes you 5 <i>1</i>/<i>2</i> hours to get here.</p>
<p>So, think the matter over and, if I should be unable to take Saturday off, you can decide on the spur of the moment, leave London at 9 o'clock on Saturday morning, and be here by 2.45. We shall then be able to discuss everything else by word of mouth—either here or there.</p>
<p>In the meantime, cordial regards from</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F. Engels

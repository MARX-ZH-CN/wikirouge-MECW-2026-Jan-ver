ENGELS TO MARX<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>IN LONDON
<br>Manchester, 29 May 1862
<br>Dear Moor,
<br>Herewith the POST OFFICE ORDER for £2, payable Kentish Town, which, if I'm not mistaken, is the office closest to you.
<br>Siebel has been blessed with a baby daughter. Anneke is with Buell's Army and, as from today, will be writing for the Augsburg paper.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I feel somewhat anxious about Halleck's troops; the thing's been dragging on so long and he would not seem to be getting any reinforcements after all,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> although Spence's lies in <i>The Times</i> certainly do not mean anything.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> Willich is colonel (THE ETERNAL COLONEL!) commanding the 32nd Indiana Regiment.
<br>As for the business of Klein,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> I am heartily glad for his sake, poor devil. I'll return Eichhoff's letter to you as soon as I've read it to Lupus, but I can't go and see him at the moment, as I have a swollen tonsil, which has kept me at home these past few evenings.
<br>It now seems as though some kind of guerrilla warfare has started up after all, but certainly nothing of any significance and, should there be just one victory, reinforcements will move up together with some cavalry and soon put paid to the thing. A defeat might well prove disastrous.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

<h4 class="mw-headline" id="ME20-74-2">Meeting of Central Council May 1, 1866</h4><a id="Meeting_of_Central_Council_May_1,_1866"></a>
<p><i>The minutes are in Cremer's hand on pp. 123-26 of the Minute Book.</i></p>
<p>Citizen <i>Carter</i> in the chair.</p>
<p>The minutes of the previous meeting were read and confirmed.</p>
<p>Citizens Jung and Dupont proposed that Citizen Giacomo Trani be elected secretary for Italy. In proposing Citizen Trani, Citizen Jung eulogised Citizen Trani's devotion to the principles of liberty and the cause of progress generally.</p>
<p>Citizen <i>Longuet</i>, [here a clipping from The Commonwealth, No. 165, May 5, 1866, is pasted into the Minute Book] the Secretary for Belgium, read from the Brussels <i>Tribune du Peuple</i> an exhortation to the wireworkers of Belgium not to engage with the London master wire-workers at the present time.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Citizen <i>Fox</i> laid upon the table copies of the St. Louis Miner and Artisan containing extracts from the London and Continental organs of the Association. [The clipping ends here]</p>
<p>Citizen <i>Dupont</i> read a letter from De Marckel of Granville, Manche, asking for the names of those who desired copies of the <i>Congres Ouvrier</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>He had been visiting the workmen in their dinner-hour making propagandism for the Association. He had assured them that the Association was not political but that all was fair and above board. He expected to be successful in his locality.</p>
<p>Citizen <i>Lafargue</i> [here and further on in these minutes Longuet's name was recorded originally instead of Lafargue's] read a letter from Prudhomme of Bordeaux asking where he should send the money received for members' cards. Lafargue was instructed to advise him to send it to the Central Council.</p>
<p><i>Dupont</i> read a letter from Fribourg (Paris) stating the Paris Administration were opposed to the further postponement of the Congress for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. That the September conference had given a solemn pledge to Europe to convoke the Congress in May.</p>
<p>2. That very many were waiting for the assembling of the Congress which would decide them as to giving in their adhesion to the Association.</p>
<p>3. That three months' delay will not make the Association and might destroy it. In Paris they had begun to prepare for the election of their delegates, as yet they could not say how many would be elected but they might at all events count on a score. The delegates would carry with them a complete plan of organisation for the Association as well as the results of their deliberations on the proposed questions. They were glad to hear of the progress the Association was making in England and finally they did not believe that the convocation of the Congress on the 4th of June would interfere with the prestige of the Association. The letter concluded by referring to the correspondence from the provinces as being indicative of a desire for the assembling of the Congress on June 4th but if the Central Council determined to postpone the Congress for three months, they in Paris must make the best of the decision.</p>
<p>Citizen <i>Lafargue</i> said he thought Fribourg exaggerated somewhat the injuries that would arise from the postponement of the Congress. The decision of the Central Council might cause a panic in Paris but such would not be the case in many other parts of France where the Association had only just begun.</p>
<p><i>Dupont</i> thought the Lyonnese would be favourable to the further postponement of the Congress; he judged so from past correspondence.</p>
<p><i>Jung</i> thought it essential to decide when the Congress should be held. Supposing that it was decided to further postpone it, he feared we must override the views of our Parisian friends. He would prefer August to September as in the latter month men generally would be too much engaged to attend.</p>
<p>Some of the Council having expressed a desire to (if possible) convoke the Congress on the anniversary of the Association, viz., the 28th September, Citizen Jung replied and expressed fears that such date would be almost fatal, but he would propose the first Monday in September as the day for the assembling of the Congress.</p>
<p>Citizen <i>Maurice</i> seconded the proposition<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>which was carried unanimously.
</p>
<h5 class="mw-headline" id="ME20-74-3">The Announcement to the Continent</h5>
<p><i>Marx</i> proposed, <i>Fox</i> seconded: That the secretaries of the respective nationalities announce as quickly as possible to their correspondents the above decision. Carried unanimously.
</p>
<h5 class="mw-headline" id="ME20-74-4">Nomination of Councilmen</h5>
<p>Citizens Frank Robert and Ralph Dutton were nominated by <i>Cremer</i> and <i>Lessner</i>.
</p>
<h5 class="mw-headline" id="ME20-74-5">Report of Standing Committee</h5>
<p>The Secretary then brought up the report of the Standing Committee adjourned from the last sitting of the Council, but as the Council had decided to postpone the Congress, the immediate adoption of the propositions from the Standing Committee had been obviated and their further consideration was again adjourned with the exception of the two following which were carried unanimously on the proposition of Cremer and Le Lubez:</p>
<p>"That each member of the Central Council hold himself in readiness to visit organised bodies to induce them to join the Association and to contribute towards the expenses of the Congress.</p>
<p>"That all societies sending delegates to the Congress must pay the expenses of the delegates."
</p>
<h5 class="mw-headline" id="ME20-74-6">Report of Deputations</h5>
<p><i>Jung</i> gave report of his and Citizen Lafargue's visit to No. 2 Lodge of Operative Bricklayers. They had been most enthusiastically received and had received promises of support. The members had also expressed surprise that they had not been waited on before.</p>
<p><i>Cremer</i> reported that he had waited on the City of London Ladies' Shoemakers who were compelled to adjourn from pressure of business. Consequently he did not get a hearing but they had invited him to their next meeting and promised him a hearing. Cremer also reported that he had made arrangements with the Secretary of the Day Working Bookbinders for a deputation to wait on their next meeting. [here three lines from a report in The Commonwealth, No. 165, May 5, 1866, are pasted into the Minute Book.]</p>
<p>Citizen <i>Dupont</i> stated that the French branch in London of the International Association had resolved to form a co-operative association.
</p>
<h5 class="mw-headline" id="ME20-74-7">The Tailors and their late Strike</h5>
<p><i>Lessner</i> reported that as a number of German tailors had been imported into Edinburgh and as it was currently reported that some of the London employers were making arrangements to bring several here, the German tailors resident in London had formed themselves into a committee and wished to co-operate with the Council of the International Working Men's Association to checkmate the designs of the employers and their agents which they had in Germany.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Marx</i> stated that if Lessner would send him the facts, that he would directly communicate with the German papers. <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Council then adjourned.</p>

<p>J. D. Prior. Nominated by Citizen <i>Cremer.</i>
</p>
<h5 class="mw-headline" id="ME20-74-11">Secretary for Poland</h5>
<p>The <i>General Secretary</i> asked for instructions on the above question as another edition of the Address and Statutes were being printed and as the present nominal secretary for Poland [Holtrop] had not attended the Council for months; he wished to know if his name was to be allowed to remain as secretary.</p>
<p>Citizen <i>Marx</i> proposed Citizen Bobczynski.</p>
<p>Citizen <i>Fox</i> seconded the proposition. Carried unanimously.
</p>
<h5 class="mw-headline" id="ME20-74-12">American Secretary</h5>
<p>Citizen Fox was elected secretary for America in place of Citizen Leon Lewis.
</p>

<h5 class="mw-headline" id="ME20-74-15">To Coopers</h5>
<p>Cremer, Dupont and Jung.
</p>
<h5 class="mw-headline" id="ME20-74-16">Report of Deputations</h5>
<p><i>Jung</i> reported the result of his visit to No. 1 Lodge OBL. [Operative Bricklayers] They had warmly received him and had promised to urge on their Executive the necessity of sending a delegate to the Congress.
</p>
<h5 class="mw-headline" id="ME20-74-17">Correspondence</h5>
<p><i>Dupont</i> read a letter from Lyons. On the 30th of April they had held a meeting at which 210 members attended, 'when five members were elected to attend the Congress. A committee of 5 was also elected to consider and report on the various questions in the programme. They wished to know whether they were to retain the money they received for members' cards till the Congress, or if they were to send it to the Central Council. They hoped soon to have from 2,000 to 3,000 members in Lyons. They had lately received a request from Villefranche for permission to open a new branch there.</p>
<p>Citizens <i>Fox</i> and <i>Hales</i> proposed:</p>
<p>That the Lyonnese be requested to send to the Central Council one-fourth [here the words "one-third," originally written down, were changed to "one-fourth"] of the contributions they receive for members' cards.</p>
<p>Citizens <i>Marx</i> and <i>Jung</i> proposed:</p>
<p>That Citizen Dupont write to the Lyonnese telling them they are at liberty to use the money they have in hand if they do not obtain sufficient to pay the expenses of the delegates by voluntary contributions.</p>
<p>For Fox's resolution — 6. For amendment — 8.</p>
<p>Amendment carried.</p>
<p>Citizens <i>Howell</i> and <i>Cremer</i> proposed that all branches of the Association remit to the Central Council not less than one-fourth of the money they receive from members' contributions.</p>
<p>Amendment proposed by <i>Marx</i> and <i>Jung:</i></p>
<p>That the question of branch contributions to the Central Council be referred to the Standing Committee except the case of Lyons.</p>
<p>For resolution — 5. For amendment — 4.</p>
<p>Citizen <i>Jung</i> in the absence of [Here a clipping from The Commonwealth, No. 166, May 12, 1866, is pasted into the Minute Book] the secretary for Italy [Trani] read a letter from Citizen Canessa, of Genoa, the editor of a working men's paper in that seaport. It gave an account of the federation of working men's associations in Genoa, and expressed a desire for further information concerning the principles and procedure of the International Working Men's Association.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Citizen <i>Jung</i> laid copies of the last number of the <i>Vorbote</i> on the table and read extracts from its monthly bulletin. From this it appeared that fifty-three members had joined the Association in Geneva in April last, and notice of adhesion had been received from the following recently founded sections, namely, [in] Biel (Canton Berne); [in] Lausanne (Canton Vaud); in Grafrath (Rhenish Prussia); in St. Imier, a mixed body of German and Latin race; in Porrentruy (Canton Berne). The mixed (Teutono-Latin) section of Chaux-de-Fonds had increased [by] sixty in April last, and the pure Latin section by forty-five members.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The same Secretary announced that the Central Committee of Geneva had received the following letter from Gaspare Stampa, of Milan, in the name of the Central Committee of Italian working men's associations<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>:</p>
<p>The word "Jung" is in handwriting.
</p>
<blockquote><p>"Milan, April 1866 "Respected Committee, — The fraternal bond of the Italian working men's associations was formed in Naples in October 1865,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>and at the same time a committee was appointed to bring this union to the general cognisance, and to set it into operation according to the resolution sent herewith.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"Our aims are your aims, and the more extensive our relations, the more powerful is our life.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"The Central Committee, whose organ I am, would not be doing its duty if it did not claim your co-operation. The death of Professor Savi in Genoa, who was one of the most indefatigable propagandists of the working class question, as well as the distance from each other of the members of the Committee, who live in different places, have been in this, the first year of our existence, the cause of much hindrance to our work.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"We hereby give our full and entire adhesion to your programme, and we beg you at the same time to gladden us with your fraternal intercourse, and to send us your organ the Vorbote, in order that our <i>Moniteur</i> [Il Giornale delle Associazioni Operaie Italiane] may make use of its important and praiseworthy contents.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"In the name of the Central Committee,</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"Fraternally yours,</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"<i>Gustav Stampa</i>. [an error; should be: Gaspare Stampa; newspaper clipping ends here]"</p></blockquote>
<p>The General Secretary read correspondence from the Darlington Shoemakers expressing their deep interest in the Association and promising future support. Also from the Darlington Tailors sending in their adhesion and 5s. Citizen <i>Fox</i> gave notice that at the next meeting of the Council he should call attention to a passage in the last letter of Citizen Engels<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>which passage involved the question of nationalities. [here a clipping from The Commonwealth, No. 166, May 12, 1866, is pasted into the Minute Book]
</p>
<h5 class="mw-headline" id="ME20-74-18">Excursion to Ireland</h5>
<p>Citizen <i>Weston</i> brought before the Central Committee the project of Mr. Lilley, to form an excursion party of 300 persons to Ireland in July or August next. As this body had at heart the amelioration of the relations between the English and Irish peoples, he thought it was opportune to bring the matter to their notice. Mr. Lilley had communicated with the manager of the London and North-Western Railway, who had responded favourably to Mr. Lilley's overtures. [The newspaper clipping ends here]</p>
<p>The Council then adjourned.</p>

The bootmakers of Geneva, owing to the low price of their wages, the increase of rent and every necessary of life, had resolved to ask for an advance of wages. They presented a tariff to the masters.

We would remind you of what we said at the time about the tailors' strike, viz., that the Continental workers should not agree to go to work in London because when their English fellow-workers returned to their former jobs the Continental workers would find themselves on the street and without any means.<br>"The tailors' strike ended to the supreme satisfaction of the tailors and to the great dissatisfaction of the employers, and it ended that way precisely because the International Working Men's Association had printed a warning in many papers (and incident ally in <i>Le Siècle</i> as well) which prevented the employers from hiring foreign workers as they had planned to. Many English papers commented, some with pleasure, others with chagrin, on the splendid results achieved thanks to the initiative of the International Working Men's Association." A similar appeal was printed in the <i>Journal de l'Association Internationale des Travailleurs,</i> No. 6, May 13, 1866.</span>

It contained the French translation of the Provisional Rules (see Note 36), the appeal of the Paris section to the members of the International Association, issued in the summer of 1865 (see Note 112), the French delegation's report of the London Conference of 1865, the programme of the Geneva Congress of 1866, endorsed by the London Conference, and other material.</span>

The employers tried to replace them with tailors from Germany, 57 of whom were brought over in April. With a view to preventing the further import of foreign workers and to supporting the strikers, the German tailors living in London formed a committee of which Lessner was appointed president and Haufe secretary. On May 4, 1866 this committee issued the following appeal to the German tailors:<br>"Fellow-Workers! The employers have succeeded in bringing in tailors from Germany to Edinburgh, to supplant those who are demanding higher wages and a shorter working day. Upon setting foot on English soil these men signed a contract to work for a specified period of time; violation of this contract holds the threat of imprisonment. In order to show our comrades at home why the employers in Britain want to use German workers, and in order to make impossible this modern trafficking in human beings, a committee has been formed which has as its object to frustrate the plans of the employers. The committee needs support if it is to be a success. We therefore call on all our compatriots to give us their every support. It is in our own interests as working men resolutely to check-mate the employers' plans and to prove to our British comrades that we travel to other countries not for the purpose of obligingly helping to lower wages. As soon as means permit we will call a joint public meeting to discuss the measures necessary for achieving our object. The committee meets every Tuesday at 8 o'clock in the evening at the Crown Public House, Hedden Court, Regent Street, to receive voluntary contributions. On behalf of the Committee: F. Lessner — President, A. Haufe — Secretary. London, May 4, 1866."</span>

He got in touch with the General Council through J. Ph. Becker. On April 29, 1866 he wrote to Jung that he was prepared to form a section of the International in Genoa. The General Council intended to avail itself of the journal to publish the Inaugural Address and Provisional Rules in Italian. On May 26, 1866, Canessa however informed the Council that he was joining Garibaldi in his Venice expedition and that therefore he would not be corresponding with the Council for a while.</span>

Engels wrote these articles in January-April 1866, on Marx's request, in connection with the dispute that arose in the General Council following the London Conference's (1865) decision to include the question of Poland's independence in the agenda of the forthcoming Geneva Congress. To substantiate the International's policy on the national question it was necessary, on the one hand, to show the fallacy of the Proudhonists' nihilist views on the national question and, on the other, to expose the reactionary essence of the so-called "principle of nationalities" demagogically expounded by Bonapartist circles.</span>

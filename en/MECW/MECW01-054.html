<br><em>No. 231 of the Register of Births</em>
<br>In the year eighteen hundred and eighteen, on the <em>seventh day</em> of the month of <em>May</em>, at <em>four</em> o'clock in the <em>afternoon</em>, there appeared before me, registrar of births, marriages and deaths at <em>Trier</em> burgomaster's office in <em>Trier</em> district, <em>Herr Heinrich Marx</em>, domiciled in Trier, aged <em>thirty-seven,</em> by profession <em>barrister of the Higher Court of Appeal</em>, who showed me a <em>male</em> child and stated that the said child had been born in <em>Trier</em>, on the <em>fifth</em> day of the month of <em>May</em> at <em>two</em> o'clock in the <em>morning</em>, to <em>Herr Heinrich Marx</em>, barrister by profession, domiciled in <em>Trier</em>, and his wife <em>Henriette Presborck</em>, and that they wished to give the name <em>Carl</em> to this their child. After the aforesaid showing of the child and the above statement made in the presence of two witnesses, namely: <em>Herr Carl Petrasch</em>, aged <em>thirty-two</em>, by profession <em>government secretary</em>, domiciled in <em>Trier</em>, and <em>Mathias Kropp</em>, aged <em>twenty-one</em>, by profession <em>office employee</em>, domiciled in <em>Trier</em>, had taken place, I drew up in writing in the presence of the exhibitor of the child and the witnesses the present <em>certificate</em> on all this in double original, which after being read aloud were signed by the exhibitor of the child, the witnesses and myself.
<br>Done in <em>Trier</em> on the day, month and year as above.
<br><em>Carl Petrasch. Kropp. Mane. E. Grach.</em>

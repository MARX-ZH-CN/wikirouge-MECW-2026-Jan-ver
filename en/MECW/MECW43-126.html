MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 10 December 1868</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>You must return the enclosed letter to me immediately after reading it, since I must send it back to Kugelmann.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Kugelmann (there is nothing else worthy of notice in his letter, which I am not sending, as I wish to reply to him) has this to say about Dr Freund, the 'author' of the letter:</p>
<p>'Recently, in Dresden, I recruited a promising pupil for you in the shape of a very intelligent colleague, a university teacher in Breslau. He told me he had written a small study on the worker question. I recommended him to read your book<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>before publishing his study. His own reflections had led him to Malthusian ideas.— I would like to have the enclosed letter returned <i>quite soon,</i> since I still have to reply to it.—Freund is now engaged in an <i>epoch-making</i> uior^dealing with the development of the normal and pathological pelvis, in particular, and of the skeleton, in general. In Dresden he gave a lecture on this that created a sensation. The professors and privy councillors received his brilliant discoveries with a dignified air of superiority, which vexed me. At the close of our section meeting I said a few words in order to emphasise Freund's achievements in a complimentary manner and I asked those who agreed with me to rise. The entire section rose, but—they were perfidious enough to omit this ovation from the minutes of the meeting. When I wanted to insist on its inclusion, Freund intervened himself and said he did not wish it. I believe he now regrets this. This is to make his letter understandable. When his work appears, Engels will, in any case, have to plough through it'.</p>
<p>(It appears you have to plough through everything.)</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

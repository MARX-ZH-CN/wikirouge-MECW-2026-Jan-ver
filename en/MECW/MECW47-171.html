ENGELS TO PASQUALE MARTIGNETTI</p>
<p>IN BENEVENTO</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London, 19 May 1885]</p>
<p>Dear Citizen,</p>
<p>...on the etc. I sent you, by registered mail, the translation<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> with my comments. I am very sorry that my limited practice of Italian has not enabled me to do them better, but I hope they will be intelligible nonetheless. I am amazed that, without having lived in Germany and learned the language there, you have been able to render my thoughts so well. I only found a few abbreviated, idiomatic and proverbial expressions where there was an error; and even these are impossible to understand properly for someone who has not spoken the everyday language and even the dialects of the country--things which are not to be found in grammars and dictionaries. And in sev- eral cases when you have understood the meaning well, I think you could be a little freer and more adventurous.</p>
<p>I fear that the note about 'Mark' is not very clear. It is the only note which I think should be printed. The others are for your infor- mation only. If therefore you have any doubts about that note, please let me know and I shall try and rewrite it.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Please excuse the long time it has taken me to do the revision. But my days are taken up with dictating Marx's manuscripts, and my evenings are not always free. In addition, I have had a Danish trans- lation<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> to check at the same time, not to mention the English transla- tion of <i>Capital.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thanking you again for the considerable work you have done on my behalf, I remain</p>
<p>Your devoted
</p>

<li id="cite_note-4"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-4">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The idea of translating<i> Capital</i> into English occurred to Marx as early as 1865, when he was working on the manuscript (see Marx's letter to Engels of 31 July 1865, present edition, Vol. 42). The British journalist and member of the Interna tional's General Council, Peter Fox, was to help Marx find a publisher. However, this matter was not settled due to Fox's death in 1869. The English translation of the first volume of<i> Capital,</i> edited by Engels, did not appear until after Marx's death, in January 1887, and was published by Swan Sonnenschein, Lowrey &amp; Co., London. The translation was done by Samuel Moore and Edward Aveling between mid-1883 and March 1886. Eleanor Marx-Aveling took part in the preparatory work for the edition (see also this volume, pp. 33 and 127-28).</span>

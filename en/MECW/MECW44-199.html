MARX TO FERDINAND JOZEWICZ<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>IN BERLIN</p>
<p>[London,] 24 February 1872</p>
<p>Citizen Secretary,</p>
<p>I can only write a few words today. Because of the conspiracy of the 'international police' with certain <i>faux frères</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> within the International, the General Council has heaped so many tasks upon me that I have even been compelled to put aside my theoretical work. So to business:</p>
<p>1. A resolution of the General Council, based on the four- month-long delay in printing the stamps (itself due to unforeseen obstacles in London), has set back the date by which unsold stamps should be returned from <i>1 March</i> to <i>1 July.</i> (Be kind enough to inform Liebknecht of this since I have no time to write to him at present.)</p>
<p>2. As far as double payment for the stamps is concerned, you have only to state in your report on 1 July that such-and-such a proportion of the money being forwarded stems from that source.</p>
<p>3. As far as the 'corresponding secretary' is concerned, the General Council leaves it to the Berlin section to arrange the matter as it thinks fit.</p>
<p>4. The Berlin section falls into the category of countries where 'legal obstacles' exist to regular organisation and in such countries the sections have absolute freedom to constitute themselves in a manner appropriate to the law of the land, without thereby forfeiting <i>any right</i> possessed by the other sections.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>5. The next Congress will be held in September 1872. The General Council has not yet decided on a location for the gathering.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> The Social-Democratic Party would be well-advised to let us know without delay when they intend to hold their Congress.</p>
<p>6. The periodic reports of the General Council have been replaced by its weekly reports in <i>The Eastern Post,</i> the first despatch of which you will receive today.</p>
<p>6.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> The <i>Volksstaat</i> is one of the organs in question.</p>
<p>7. The General Council thanks the Berlin section for having already appointed a statistical commission.</p>
<p>8. The Council enquires through me in what relationship the <i>Hamburgers</i> (i.e. the Committee of the Social-Democratic Party)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> stand towards the General Council. Up to now we have not had a word from them.</p>
<p>9. The General Council requests the Berlin section to declare its approval of the resolutions of the last Conference of delegates of the International (in London).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<p>With fraternal greetings,</p>
<p>K. M.

At its next meeting on 18 June the Council decided on The Hague as the venue for the Congress and appointed a special commission (Engels, Edouard Vaillant, Joseph MacDonnel) to prepare an official announcement of the forthcoming Congress. The announcement was written by Engels and despatched to <i>The International Herald,</i> which published it on 29 June 1872 (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 170-73).—325, 366, 372, 374, 376, 392, 396, 398, 401, 404, 407, 409, 411-13, 415, 417, 418, 422, 425, 426</span>

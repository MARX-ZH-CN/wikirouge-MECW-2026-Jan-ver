MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 14 November 1867</p>
<p>DEAR FRED, A letter from Russia enclosed and one from Solingen.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>I believe the Russo-German<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>must be the same man that Meyer<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>told us about.</p>
<p>Kugelmann has sent me a copy of the <i>Deutsche Volkszeitung</i> (Hanover) containing a short notice of my book<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>written by himself. In it, Kugelmann has imitated one of your articles,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>and by no means happily. As this paper is democratic, he could have gone into the content more. Among other things, he has me arrive 'at the' admittedly 'astonishing conclusion that all capital is derived <i>from unpaid labour power</i>. Among the 'German authorities on political economy' whose 'verdict' he seeks, Mr 'Faucher' (fortunately printed as 'Taucher') appears at the <i>head</i> of the list and Roscher at the end.</p>
<p>Your 'revelations' in respect of Freiligrath have created a great sensation here at home.</p>
<p>At this moment, Bonaparte has need of a riot or a secret society in Paris if he is to extricate himself from his predicament. For the time being, he is treating the <i>Ligue de la Paix</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>as such. However, that jackass Pyat is JUST NOW preparing the necessary <i>corpus delicti</i> for him from here.</p>
<p>I am being plagued by a carbunculum on the right side of my back.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

He spoke highly of Marx's merits both before science and the working class and wrote about the deep impression Volume One of <i>Capital</i> had made on him and about his acquaintance with some of the earlier works by Marx, particularly <i>A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy.</i> In his letter Dietzgen also outlined the basis of his own materialist world outlook. The letter was the beginning of a friendship between its author and Marx and Engels.<br>From Solingen Marx received a letter from Karl Klein dated 8 November 1867; he informed Marx about the activities of the local section of the International.</span>

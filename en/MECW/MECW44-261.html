ENGELS TO HERMANN JUNG</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 1 October 1872 122 Regent's Park Road</p>
<p>Dear Jung,</p>
<p>Can you furnish me with the addresses of the Secretaries of</p>
<p>1) The Iron Founders, 2) The Ship's Carpenters, 3) The Ship's Caulkers (if they have a union). I want these immediately in order to communicate with them on some strike affairs in Portugal<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>—I have applied to the British Federal Council but cannot learn that they are taking any steps whatever, and so I must act on my own hook.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>F. Engels</p>
<p>My and Mrs Engels'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>compliments to Mrs Jung and yourself.

ENGELS TO HERMANN SCHLÜTER
<br>IN HOTTINGEN-ZURICH
<br>[London,] 7 December 1886
<br>Please send me a copy of <i>The Bakuninists at Work</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> ; the only one I've got was in a bundle with other stuff. The thing is badly crumpled and requires close scrutiny. On Sunday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> afternoon the soldier<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> turned up here, where his wife had already been for several days—he's very satisfied with his success.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> Yesterday Paul, the Berliner,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> also turned up. Since I cannot easily apply myself to any really big jobs while they are here, I shall see if I can't get something or other ready for press for you; however, I would prefer to write my prefaces myself.
<br>Kindest regards.
<br>Yours,
<br>F.E.

Schlüter further wrote about Eduard Bernstein's proposal that this issue be supplied with a preface from the publishers.</span>

Eleanor Marx-Aveling and Edward Aveling made a trip around the United States at approximately the same time (see Note 601). Liebknecht stayed in Eastbourne with Engels for four days, left Liverpool on 4 September and arrived in New York on 13 September where he met the Avelings. In New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Detroit, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Washington and other cities he gave talks and lectures on the theory and history of socialism, the state of the workers' movement in Europe and other subjects. This trip, which he completed on 26 November, raised 16,000 marks for the German Social Democrats' election fund. On his way back to Germany, Liebknecht stayed with Engels in London from 5 to 10 December, following which he set off on his way home to Borsdorf near Leipzig.</span>

MARX TO FERDINAND LASSALLE<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>IN BERLIN
<br>7 March 1861 Zalt-Bommel, Holland (c/o L. Philips)
<br>Dear Lassalle,
<br>As I've already written and told you,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I intend to proceed from here to Berlin in order to discuss with you personally the possibility of joint politico-literary enterprises, but also and more especially to see you again.
<br>Now, however, I should like you to tell me exactly how matters stand as regards the following point. The only passport I have is an old one issued by the French when I was expelled in 1849.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> I could not bring myself to approach the Prussian Embassy in London. Nor did I wish to become a naturalised Englishman (like Freiligrath, Bucher, Zimmermann, etc.) and travel on an English passport. The following question arises: In 1845, when pursued in Belgium by the Prussian government,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> I obtained through my brother-in-law<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> a Prussian expatriation permit. On the pretext of my having ceased to be a Prussian subject, I was, as you know, expelled by the Prussian government in 1849. However, in the eyes of the law, all refugees who had spent 10 years outside the country would equally have ceased to be Prussian 'subjects'. I have never been naturalised abroad. Further, in accordance with the resolution passed by the Preliminary Parliament<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> of 1848—a resolution that was regarded as virtually binding by all German governments on the occasion of the elections to the Frankfurt parliament<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> —all refugees, even though, like Vogt, etc., they might have been naturalised abroad, could avail themselves of their German citizenship and everywhere qualify for election to parliament. I invoked this when, in 1848, I requested that my Prussian citizenship be reinstated. This was refused by the Prussian ministry of the day, though they didn't venture to treat me as a foreigner until all was up with the revolution.
<br>In practice, the only importance that attaches to this question just now is whether I shall be able to get to Berlin unimpeded. If only I can succeed in crossing the border, I shall have nothing to fear in Berlin; on the periphery, however, it's a more ticklish matter.
<br>As you know, I am here with my uncle<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> (who looks after my mother's affairs and has, in the past, frequently made me substantial advances against my share of the inheritance) in order to put my parlous finances in order. He's a stubborn man, but the fact of my being a writer greatly appeals to his vanity. So, when you write to me, you must refer to the success (<i>lucus a non lucendo</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> ) of my recent anti-Vogt pamphlet, our joint plans for a newspaper, etc. and, above all, so couch your letter that I can demonstrate my 'confidence' in my uncle by giving him the letter to read. Nor should you omit to mention something about politics. <i>Vous m'entendez, mon cher?</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> <br>With kindest regards to you and the countess.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> <br>Your
<br>K. Marx
<br>(Zalt-Bommel is near Nymwegen. I don't imagine that the name is familiar to you. However, it attracted some attention as a result of the recent floods.)
<br>The <i>conspiration de silence,</i> with which the entire German press has greeted my last piece,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> precisely as it did the previous ones, I really find most flattering, however detrimental it may be to sales. I trust your health has improved.

On 19 July, the French authorities notified Marx that he was being expelled from Paris to Morbihan, a marshy and insalubrious region in Brittany. Rather than go there, Marx decided to emigrate to England and settle in London. He left Paris on 24 August.</span>

It contained no direct polemic against Engels' articles on the Italian campaign in the <i>Volk</i> (see present edition, Vol. 16).</span>

A council of representatives of the German states, it set up a Committee of Fifty to prepare the ground for the convocation of an all-German National Assembly (see Note 282) and produced a draft of the 'Fundamental Rights and Demands of the German People'.</span>

<li id="cite_note-7"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-7">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">When writing this letter, Marx evidently had not yet received Vogt's pamphlet. What he calls the introduction was actually the second section. The first contained a verbatim report of the court proceedings against the <i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i> in Augsburg in October 1859. Vogt had sued the newspaper for reprinting, in June of that year, Karl Blind's anonymously published pamphlet <i>Warnung zur gefälligen Verbreitung,</i> which exposed him as a Bonapartist agent (Marx calls it, for brevity, <i>Zur Warnung;</i> for details of it see his polemic <i>Herr Vogt,</i> present edition, Vol. 17, pp. 111-32). Marx likens Vogt's piece to the petty-bourgeois democrat Müller-Tellering's libellous pamphlet <i>Vorgeschmack in die künftige deutsche Diktatur von Marx und Engels</i> (Cologne, 1850).</span>

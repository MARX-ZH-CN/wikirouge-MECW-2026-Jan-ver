ENGELS TO HERMANN ENGELS
<br>IN BARMEN
<br>London, 26 January 1893
<br>Dear Hermann,
<br>What the deuce is going on? Yesterday there was first of all a telegram from Vienna, then one from Dresden, then, at five o'clock this morning, one from New York and, at 11 this morning, your own—all inquiring after my health. Well, I haven't felt better for a long time, I can again walk an English mile, I over- rather than under-indulged in good things at Christmastime, am game for anything and perfectly fit for work and now all of a sudden I'm supposed to be seriously ill!
<br>I telegraphed back to you immediately, saying I was perfectly hale and hearty, and this I hereby confirm. Next summer I hope I shall be able to give all of you visual proof of the fact.
<br>My love to all the relatives, also to Emma<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and your children and grandchildren and, finally, to you yourself from
<br>Your old
<br>Friedrich

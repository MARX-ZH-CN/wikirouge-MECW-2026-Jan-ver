<p>[Rough copy)</p>
<p>[London,] June 30 [,1850]</p>
<p>Citizen Chairman,</p>
<p>While the June Revolution was attacked by all the watchdogs of the bourgeois class, I publicly defended those terrible days, which for me are the greatest manifestation of the struggle which the working class is pursuing against the capitalist class.</p>
<p>If I am absent from this refugee celebration today, it is because I am completely prevented by illness from being in your midst; my heart is with you.</p>
<p>Greetings and fraternity,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

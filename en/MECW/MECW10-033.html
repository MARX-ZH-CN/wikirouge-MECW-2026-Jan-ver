<br>[Rough copy)
<br>[London,] June 30 [,1850]
<br>Citizen Chairman,
<br>While the June Revolution was attacked by all the watchdogs of the bourgeois class, I publicly defended those terrible days, which for me are the greatest manifestation of the struggle which the working class is pursuing against the capitalist class.
<br>If I am absent from this refugee celebration today, it is because I am completely prevented by illness from being in your midst; my heart is with you.
<br>Greetings and fraternity,
<br>Karl Marx

<p><b>Cologne, June 26.</b> The news just received from Paris takes up so much space that we are obliged to omit all articles of critical comment.</p>
<p>Therefore only a few words to our readers. Our latest news from Paris gives this: the resignation of Ledru-Rollin and Lamartine and their ministers; the transfer of Cavaignac's military dictatorship from Algiers to Paris; Marrast the dictator in plain clothes; Paris bathed in blood; the insurrection growing into the greatest revolution that has ever taken place, into a revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie. Three days which sufficed for the July revolution and the February revolution are insufficient for the colossal contours of this June revolution, but the victory of the people is more certain than ever. The French bourgeoisie has dared to do what the French kings never dared -- it has itself cast the die. This second act of the French revolution is only the beginning of the European tragedy.

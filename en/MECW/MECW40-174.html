MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>London, 2 July 1858 9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, H averstock Hill</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>The delay in acknowledging your 'Cavalry'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>due to great domestic TROUBLE. For weeks our youngest child<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>has been suffering from HOOPING-COUGH, a most alarming illness, besides which my wife is very seedy. So my work has been damnably disrupted by this and all kinds of other domestic upsets.</p>
<p>You will remember that, while our friend Schramm was in Jersey, I secured him the position of correspondent to an American paper. Now that he's dead and after he had dunned them on several occasions, his fee of SOME 6 POUNDS has arrived and has, of course, fallen to Mr Rudolf<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>as pocket-money.</p>
<p>Otherwise nothing new here. That little London German rag once run by Gumpert has, I believe, now fallen to 'united democracy', <i>sub auspiciis</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>of the great Blind under the title <i>Neue Welt.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>I assume you have read the statements made in the <i>Star</i> by Mr Türr and by the Hungarian émigrés in Constantinople. If not, I shall send you <i>The Free Press.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>Meanwhile Kossuth still remains obdurately silent. Our excerpt from Bangya's story has appeared in the <i>Tribune.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>The row in New York will force Kossuth to speak. Thus I may have to come right out into the open in this matter. Pulszky had <i>de longue main</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>provided a loophole in the <i>Tribune</i> when he described Bangya as a former spy of <i>Metternich's</i> (!).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Klapka, whom I met for a moment or two at Freiligrath's, remarked drily of Bangya: <b>Finis coronat opus.</b><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>He seems to be very blasé about Kossuth. Is presently dabbling in Turkish shares.</p>
<p>Herewith two letters from New York.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>I have had no word from Ephraim Artful<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup>for a fortnight. Being convinced, OF COURSE, that there was small likelihood of my letter being put to discreet use by him, I worded it with the utmost caution so THAT IT WILL BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO ABUSE IT. Apart from the special CIRCUMSTANCES of the CASE, concerning which I gave him your opinion pretty well verbatim, I censured duelling only in so far as it is claimed as privilege of caste by fellows who believe that their insults <i>must</i> be punished otherwise than those of a tailor, cobbler, etc. The revolutionary thing to do, I told him, when confronted with such inane presumption and laddies of this ilk, was to adopt the 'standpoint of the lout' and the 'code of the bludgeon'. On the other hand, in reply to Ephraim's pedantry, I said that duelling was among the things Aristotle described as being 'indifferent' and which one could either take or leave as one pleased; I told him he was right in saying that it was a relic of a bygone stage of development but that, 'given the one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness of <i>bourgeois</i> relations, individuality could sometimes assert itself only in feudal form'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>I trust that, come what may, you will send me an article on India<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup>next week. There is ample material for an article for the <i>Tribune,</i> which will otherwise reprint stuff from <i>The Times,</i> etc. Anyway, all that matters is that articles should be sent.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>Regards to Lupus. Humboldt has published a very 'flattering' letter in the <i>Tribune</i> addressed to Fröbel,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup>who has published a book of his American travels.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup></p>

<li id="cite_note-11"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-11">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Marx means J. Weydemeyer's letter of 28 February 1858 from Milwaukee and  A. Komp's letter of 15 June 1858 from New York, both written to him. Marx  did not enclose them in his letter to Engels and they were mislaid among his  papers. Some time later, Marx found them and replied to Weydemeyer on  1 February 1859 (see this volume, pp. 374-78). His letter to Komp has not been  found but we may judge of its contents by the above-mentioned letter to  Weydemeyer. Komp was a leader of the New York Communist Club, and his  letter to Marx contained information and requests similar to those contained in  a letter from Friedrich Kamm, another leader of the Club, written on  19 December 1857 (see Note 297). After replying to his American correspondents,  Marx forwarded their letters to Engels on 9 February 1859 (see this volume,  pp. 384-85).—324, 326, 337, 339, 374, 384</span>

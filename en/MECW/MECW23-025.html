<p>Sir, — In his immortal poem, Dante says that one of the most cruel tortures of an exile is the necessity of having to rub elbows with all sorts of people. I have deeply felt the truth of his complaint when being forced to enter for a moment into a public controversy with men like Messrs. Charles Bradlaugh and Co. I shall, however, no longer allow him to turn the quarrel he has fastened upon me into the cheap and convenient means of advertising himself abroad.</p>
<p>He published against me an accusation which, if published in Germany, would have made him the laughing-stock of all parties, I thereupon challenged him to publish such facts as might have lent him the slightest pretext for a calumny as ridiculous as it is infamous. I did so in order, not to justify myself, but to expose him. With the low cunning of a solicitor's clerk he tries to escape this liability by inviting me to a "Court of Honour."</p>
<p>Does he really fancy that a Bradlaugh, or the editors of the Paris <i>demi-monde</i> Press, or those of the Bismarckian papers at Berlin, or the <i>Tages-Presse</i> at Vienna, or the <i>Criminal-Zeitung</i> at New York, or the <i>Moscow Gazette,</i> have only to slander me, in order to make me amenable to clear my public character, and even to do so before a "Council of Honour," of which the friends of those "honourable" gentlemen must form part?</p>
<p>I have done with Mr. Charles Bradlaugh, and leave him to all the comforts he may derive from the quiet contemplation of his own self.</p>
<p>I am, Sir,</p>
<p>Yours obediently,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

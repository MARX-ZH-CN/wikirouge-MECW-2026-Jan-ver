ENGELS TO JOHANN HEINRICH WILHELM DIETZ</p>
<p>IN STUTTGART</p>
<p>London, 13 December 1890</p>
<p>Dear Mr Dietz,</p>
<p>I have yet to tender you my warmest thanks for the magnificent birthday present you sent me. I was particularly delighted with Rei- nicke's pictures; it's the first time I have seen German genre paintings depicting life in a big city that are altogether free of the stiffness and affectation which otherwise so obstinately dog German painters of genre and historical pieces. But here we have no poses — here we have life as it is lived.</p>
<p>That we tippled our way merrily through my 70th birthday you will have heard from the three Magi on their return to the Orient.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>And that things are proceeding at a brisk pace in Germany I see and hear daily, and that is best of all.</p>
<p>With cordial regards</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F. Engels

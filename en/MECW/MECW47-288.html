ENGELS TO PASQUALE MARTIGNETTI</p>
<p>IN BENEVENTO</p>
<p>[Excerpt]</p>
<p>[London,] 17 September 1886</p>
<p>...May [I th]ank<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> you for being so patient with [me] in the matter of your manuscript.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> As soon as the English translation of <i>Capital</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> has been done — in October, I hope — your ms. will be the first thing to which I shall turn my attention. I have found the <i>Kalender</i> and shall fill in the missing passage.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>F.E.

<li id="cite_note-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-3">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The idea of translating<i> Capital</i> into English occurred to Marx as early as 1865, when he was working on the manuscript (see Marx's letter to Engels of 31 July 1865, present edition, Vol. 42). The British journalist and member of the International's General Council, Peter Fox, was to help Marx find a publisher. However, this matter was not settled due to Fox's death in 1869. The English translation of the first volume of<i> Capital,</i> edited by Engels, did not appear until after Marx's death, in January 1887, and was published by Swan Sonnenschein, Lowrey &amp; Co., London. The translation was done by Samuel Moore and Edward Aveling between mid-1883 and March 1886. Eleanor Marx-Aveling took part in the preparatory work for the edition (see also this volume, pp. 33 and 127-28).</span>

<li id="cite_note-4"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-4">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The<i> Volks-Kalender</i> published in Brunswick in 1878 contained Engels' work 'Karl Marx' (see present edition, Vol. 24) which Pasquale Martignetti was translating into Italian for publication in one volume together with Marx's<i> Wage Labour and Capital.</i> Since two pages were stuck together in Martignetti's copy of the <i>Volks-Kalender,</i> he was not able to translate them in full and asked Engels to fill in the missing text in the manuscript sent to him for editing.</span>

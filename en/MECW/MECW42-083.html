<p><i>To Engels in Manchester</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 13 May 1865</b></p>
<p><b>Dear Fred</b>,</p>
<p>The £5 received with <b>thanks</b>. Will be invested as suggested.</p>
<p>You are right about the <b>Committee in Manchester</b>.</p>
<p><i>Quoad</i> E. Jones, it is necessary to march with him for the time being. He and his people will be figuring at the next Manchester <b>Conference</b> (<b>next Tuesday</b>) together with our <b>delegates</b> (Odger and Cremer <b>on the part of the International Association</b>), Howell as secretary of the <b>Reform League</b> (<b>Bricklayer, one of the members of our Council</b>) and Beales and Mason Jones as bourgeois representatives of the same <b>League</b>.</p>
<p>Without us this <b>Reform League</b> would never have come into existence, or else it would have fallen into the hands of the <b>middleclass</b>. The glorious failure of <b>Baines's Bill</b> (which will result in a <b>change of Ministry</b> and the <b>coming in</b> of the Tories), originally <b>supported by the Government, which wanted some such small measure for the hustings</b>, occurred in the Lower House itself with direct reference to the 'extravagant' demands recently put up by the <b>working class</b> (<b>i.e. our men</b>).</p>
<p>As Dronke wrote me, Reinach I, who is now <b>Managing Director</b> of the <b>Bank of Switzerland</b>, will be ruthlessly putting an end to the <b>office</b> in London, which is causing nothing but expenses. Reinach I is, of course, not bound by the same political and personal considerations as Fazy and Klapka were.</p>
<p>A ghastly carbuncle has broken out again on my left hip, <b>near</b> the <b>inexpressible part of the body</b>.</p>
<p>Regards to <b>Mrs Lizzy</b>.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.</p>
<p>Apropos. Monsieur Le Lubez, who had miscalculated about how important and dangerous he is, <b>wants now to return to the Central Council in the capacity of a representative 'for Greenwich'</b>! We replied that <i>d'abord</i> we had to wait for certain letters to come, which he had written to France at the time of the <b>conflict</b>.</p>
<p>I hardly think the <i>Social-Demokrat</i> will see out another quarter. Moses believed himself safely ensconced and didn't want to give up his prestigious position as Lassalle's really secret agent at any price. <i>Le pauvre diable!</i></p>
<p>Lassalle's will is now proven. He has left <b>nothing</b> to B. Becker apart from his '<b>nomination',</b> accompanied by rules of conduct dictated 'with all severity and authority'.

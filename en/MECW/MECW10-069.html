<p>For some time funds have been coming in so scantily for the German refugees here that these latter have suffered the greatest misery. A number of them, who so far have been unable to find any work in their trade here, have been sleeping in the streets and parks for almost a week and are suffering hunger. In various quarters the differences between the committees and allegations of biassed distribution of funds have been made a pretext for not sending any money for the refugees. Messrs. Struve, Bobzin and others have contributed to this situation by declaring that the undersigned Committee supports only "Communists".</p>
<p>We declare once again that we have, supported everybody without distinction who proved his status as a German refugee in need of support. Our books and receipts are there to prove it, and are available at any time for inspection by donors or their representatives. At a full meeting of the committee of Messrs. Struve, Bobzin and others, co-signatory Willich asked the refugees who had received support which of them had been asked whether he was a "Communist". Not one raised his hand!</p>
<p>We declare the above claims of Messrs. Struve, Bobzin and others to be lies and slander.</p>
<p>This declaration removes the pretext under which the London refugees have hitherto been deprived oï support from various quarters.</p>

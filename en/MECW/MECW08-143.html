<br><b>The previous months' issues of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung are its programme. Through its personal connections with the heads of the democratic party in England, France, Italy, Belgium and North America the editorial board is able to reflect the political and social movement abroad more correctly and clearly for its readers than any other paper. In this respect the Neue Rheinische Zeitung is the organ not only of German, but of European democracy.</b>
<br>Advertisements: A brevier line of column width (4 columns per page) or the equivalent space: i silver groschen 6 pfennigs.
<br>Advertisements of all kinds obtain very wide circulation through the many connections of our paper.

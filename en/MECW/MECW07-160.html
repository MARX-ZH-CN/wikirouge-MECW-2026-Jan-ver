<p>Cologne, August 4. Our entanglement with the office of the Public Prosecutor continues to take its course. Last Monday the responsible publisher Korff was again summoned before the examining magistrate and yesterday two of our editors, Dronke and Engels, were cited as witnesses. Dronke is away at present; Engels appeared but was not interrogated on oath, since it is supposed that the note recently confiscated in our office is in his handwriting and it is possible, therefore, that he, too, will be involved in the indictment.</p>
<p>It is clear that the prosecution is not satisfied with the manager functioning as the responsible publisher. The editor-in-chief has to be implicated, the author of the article in question has to be discovered, the editors — any one of whom could be the author of the article in question — have to be made to give evidence against one another, indeed, if possible, against themselves.

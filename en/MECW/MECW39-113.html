MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 25 October 1852 28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>We must make some other arrangements about our correspondence. We undoubtedly have a <i>fellow</i>-<i>reader</i> in Derby's Ministry. Moreover, there is again someone keeping watch, or at least attempting to do so, outside my house (of an evening). Hence I can write and tell you nothing I deem it inadvisable for the Prussian government to learn at this moment.</p>
<p>Dana is treating me very badly. I wrote to him about 6 weeks ago, telling him exactly how things stood with me and that I must be paid <i>by return</i> for the articles I had sent. He has regularly published the articles but has not yet sent the money. I, of course, must continue punctiliously, notwithstanding. Otherwise it is I who will suffer in the end.</p>
<p>Now, as much as 5 weeks ago, I mollified my LANDLORD with my prospects in America. Today the fellow calls and makes a fearful scene in front of me and the HOUSEKEEPER. Upon my finally resorting to the <i>ultima ratio</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> i.e. abuse, he retired, threatening that if I didn't produce any money this week, he would throw me out into the street, but first would land me with a BROKER.</p>
<p>4-5 days ago 130 copies of the <i>Brumaire</i> arrived from Cluss. As yet I have been unable to get them from the customs because this would mean paying 10/9d. As soon as I've got the stuff out, I'll send it to the place you know and at once draw a bill on the same. With this and the Dana business I now have over £30 outstanding, yet often have to lose an entire day for a shilling. I assure you that, when I consider my wife's sufferings and my own impotence, I feel like consigning myself to the devil.</p>
<p>Kothes and Bermbach were arrested because I had sent the latter through the former a work necessary to the defence, which (despite thin paper and small pearl type) was somewhat bulky.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The government thought it had made a splendid catch. But on the closer examination <i>jeune</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Saedt raised heaven and earth to have the thing suppressed, for the document contained curious STRICTURES on the capability, etc., of <i>jeune</i> Saedt and could, if communicated to the juries, only help to acquit the <i>accusés</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the <i>Neue Preussische Zeitung</i>, 'G. Weerth' is said to be a member of the Central Authority in Cologne, and, indeed, this is cited from the bill of indictment.</p>
<p>Tell Weerth that I have heard nothing from Duncker.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>As soon as the trial is over, and whatever its outcome, we two must bring out one or two sheets, 'For the Enlightenment of the Public'. No such favourable moment to address the <i>nation en large</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> will ever recur. Furthermore, we must not tolerate any semblance of RIDICULE which not even the moral dignity and scientific profundity of the gentle Heinrich<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> are capable of dispelling.</p>
<p>Cherval has himself written to the German Workers' Society in London<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> saying that he 'is a <i>spy</i>, but in the noble sense of "Cooper's spy"'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> I have conveyed the necessary explanation to one of the lawyers<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> by a safe route.</p>
<p>We should already start casting about with a view to the publication on the 'Cologne trial' mooted above. I think it would be best if you were to write to Campe asking him to give you the name of a <i>reliable agent</i>, should he himself be too afraid. Since your credit is good, the agent can be told that he will receive the money in, say, 3 months' time (against a bill), if he has not in the meantime repaid himself from the sales (as he certainly will do). For that matter, the cost of printing this sort of stuff would amount at most to 25 talers.</p>
<p><i>Vale!</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> And think the matter over. We cannot remain silent and if we don't see to the printing in good time, we shall again miss the boat. We should, of course, have to make sure that the agent is not downright dishonest, for the thing will even have 'commercial' value.

They were accused of stealing this money. A libel campaign against Bauer and Pfänder was started in the press (Schweizerische National-Zeitung, 7 January 1851; Republik der Arbeiter, New York, Nos. 19, 20 and 21 for 23 and 30 August and 6 September 1851). In the statement made on 21 January 1852 and mentioned here, Pfänder refuted the libel and said that on 20 November 1850 the court had acknowledged the charge to be invalid (see present edition, Vol. 38, Note 328). The German Workers' Educational Society in London was founded in February 1840 by Karl Schapper, Joseph Moll and other members of the League of the Just. After the reorganisation of the League of the Just in the summer of 1847 and the founding of the Communist League, the latter's local communities played the leading role in the Society. In 1847 and 1849-50 Marx and Engels took an active part in the Society's work</span>

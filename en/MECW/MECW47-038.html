ENGELS TO MAX QUARCK</p>
<p>IN RUDOLSTADT</p>
<p>London, 13 November 1883</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I have kept you waiting a long time for an answer.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Firstly because I had to keep to my bed on account of a mild but tedious indisposi- tion and, secondly, because you are not the first to have approached me about the matter in question. Hence, before I could reply to you, I had to make further inquiries.</p>
<p>The result is that Mr Eduard Bernstein of Zurich has now definitely expressed his intention of translating <i>The Poverty etc.</i> into German and has enlisted my support. ' ' 8 This I cannot possibly refuse, since he was the first to speak to me about the matter, his qualifications for the task are known to me, and immediate printing in Zurich is assured, should it become apparent that publication in Germany itself might meet with difficulties.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, and in the knowledge that neither I nor anyone else is legally empowered to prevent you or others from pub- lishing a translation of that work, I have nothing further to say other than to express my thanks to you for having thought fit to approach me in the first place.</p>
<p>I remain,</p>
<p>Yours very truly,</p>
<p>F. Engels

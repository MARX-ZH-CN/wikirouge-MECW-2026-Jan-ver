ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 11 May 1860</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>My mother in grave danger. Two telegrams from Barmen. No one's allowed to see her. I'm to go over there again, the necessary steps are being taken. How it will turn out I cannot say. This business has put my mind into a turmoil; apparently it really is typhoid.</p>
<p>I can't write to you about anything else today, my mind being altogether too full, and besides it's too late. For seven weeks now I've been living in a state of continual tension and excitation which has now reached a climax—never has it been so bad. Fortunately, I am ALL RIGHT again physically. If I have to go to Barmen, I can probably so arrange things as to spend another day in London <i>en route,</i> in which case I shall see you.</p>
<p>Many regards.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

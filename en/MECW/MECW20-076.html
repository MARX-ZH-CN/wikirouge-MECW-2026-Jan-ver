<br>The minutes are in the form of a clipping from The Commonwealth, No. 172, June 23, 1866, pasted onto p. 139 of the Minute Book. The heading and the first and last lines of the text are in Cremer's hand.
<br>Citizen <em>Weston</em> in the chair.
<br>The debate on the war attracted a large concourse of members. It was ably opened by Citizen <em>Eccarius,</em> who illustrated his address with a map 'of Germany, made for the occasion. He was followed by Citizens <em>Le Lubez, Fox, Lafargue, Marx,</em> who made an highly interesting<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> speech, <em>Carter, Dutton</em> and <em>Hales.</em> Speeches were made in French and English. The debate was adjourned until Tuesday evening next at the same hour, when the question of nationality will be treated of. Citizen <em>Le Lubez</em> gave notice that he will propose the following resolutions:
<br>"(1) The Central Council of the International Association of Working Men recommend to their fellow working men in arms not to waste their strength in slaying each other, but to economise it for the defence of their rights against their only enemies, the enslavers of the working class. Their opinion is that no man need obey any power he has had no voice in electing, or any law he has had no voice in making. Therefore, (2) every soldier, who has not made the cause he is fighting for his own by being convinced that it is just, is relieved from his obligation to fight for it. (3) If that right should be denied him and that force be used to coerce him, he has a right, and <em>it is his duty</em> to defend that right, which is the right of the people, by using force himself."
<br>Before the debate began, the <em>Courrier Français</em> of the 17th inst. was brought before the Council and the rejoinder of the students was read and given to the editor of the <em>Commonwealth</em> to translate and publish the same. For the previous correspondence see the <em>Commonwealth</em> of June 9.

<blockquote><br>To the Working men of All Countries!<br>The Youth of France</br></blockquote>
<blockquote><br>Brethren, — You have understood that war was a violation of the most sacred rights of humanity, and you have responded to our appeal. Thanks, a thousand thanks!</blockquote>
<blockquote><br>United for the noblest of causes, we shall continue to claim in common the rights for which humanity has ever combated; labour and universal peace will guide us in this path, the harmony of minds and hearts will recompense us for our efforts.</blockquote>
<blockquote><br>"The masters of the world" will in vain endeavour to revive the obsolete quarrels of the past, the traditional rivalries of nations. Universal Reason will respond to the appeals of the fife and drum by a prodigious cry of peace, by a warm grasp of all hands and all hearts.</blockquote>
<blockquote><br>We are pleased to have been understood by those upon whom we base all our hopes, we are proud to have contributed our small share to the advent of that bright day in which all men, united by science, will march with one accord to the final conquest of liberty.</blockquote>
<blockquote><br>Our forefathers, led astray and enslaved, had for their war-cry "God and our country!"</blockquote>
<blockquote><br>Let us, the great grandsons of 1793, have for supreme aim to inscribe on the one only flag of the people these two words, which are the symbols of our convictions and our hopes, "Reason and Fraternity!"</blockquote>
<blockquote><br>It is for you, working men, to realise in the future these vast projects — it is for you to cement the union of mankind by your labour, the firmness of your principles, and your inflexible devotion to the salvation of the human race.</blockquote>
<blockquote><br>Be assured that your brothers will not abandon you in the struggle.</blockquote>

<br>The Central Council has received the following letter for adhesion to the working men's response:

<blockquote><br>"Friends! — We, the undersigned men of this place, endorse every sentiment from the young students of Paris. and likewise the response of the men of all nations; and we hope and trust that the time is not far distant, when every man will know his position in society as a man.</blockquote>

<br>The minutes are in Cremer's hand on pp. 140-42 of the Minute Book.
<br>Citizen <em>Fox</em> in the chair.
<br>Citizen <em>Marx</em> introduced to the Council Citizen Fontaine of Brussels. He also announced that Fribourg would publish week by week in the <em>Courrier Français</em> their elaboration of the questions to be submitted to Congress.

<h5 class="mw-headline" id="Correspondence_3">Correspondence</h5>
<br><em>Dupont</em> read letters from Tolain and Fribourg announcing the seizure of the <em>Courrier Français</em><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> and blaming the Council for postponing the Congress.

<h5 class="mw-headline" id="Report_of_Deputation">Report of Deputation</h5>
<br><em>Jung</em> reported West End Cabinet-Makers fully agreed with our principles and would join.

<h5 class="mw-headline" id="French_Revolution_June_1848">French Revolution June 1848</h5>
<br><em>Lessner</em> asked would the Council take part in celebrating the event. Question postponed.

<h5 class="mw-headline" id="Italian_Secretary">Italian Secretary</h5>
<br>Citizen <em>Fox</em> read letter from Citizen Trani stating he had corresponded with several Italian societies but as yet had not received an answer. The present position of his country placed him in an awkward position. He also complained of an attack in Rive Gauche by Citizen Lafargue who had placed Mazzini and Garibaldi side by side with [Bismarck] and declaring them as bad as Bismarck. He believed Mazzini and Garibaldi were both good Socialists.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> In consequence of such attack he must tender his resignation as Italian secretary.
<br>Citizen <em>Lafargue</em> replied that what he had written he had written in his individual capacity, not as a member of the Central Council who were in no way responsible for his opinions.
<br>Citizen <em>Fontaine</em> said he has expressed the same opinions only in a stronger manner.
<br>After some discussion Cremer [proposed], Dutton seconded:
<br>That we pass to the order of the day and that Citizen Trani be written to and told that the Council are not responsible for Citizen Lafargue's views. Carried unanimously.

<h5 class="mw-headline" id="The_Adjourned_Debate">The Adjourned Debate</h5>
<br>The debate was resumed by Citizen <em>Bobczynski</em> who said that though Mazzini, Garibaldi and Bismarck were acting together, they were acting from different motives' .
<br>If the Association was only to be social, it would never be great. Its first duty was to get rid of tyrants on the Continent.
<br>Citizen Jung thought that although Garibaldi's heart was undoubtedly right, his head and sword were in the wrong place. He was sorry to see him and Mazzini in alliance with Bismarck. He thought the upshot of the war would be revolution.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> <br>The debate was continued by Citizens Bobczynski, Lafargue, Cremer, Fontaine.
<br>Citizen Dutton said that workmen of all countries could work out their political and social independence without fighting for nationalities.
<br>Citizens <em>Bobczynski</em> and Carter then gave notice of the following resolution: [here a clipping from The Commonwealth, No. 175, July 14, 1866, is pasted into the Minute Book]
<br>That the London members of the International Working Men's Association consider the present conflict on the Continent to be one between tyrants, and advise working men to be neutral, but to associate themselves with a view to acquire strength by unity and to use the strength so acquired in striking a final blow at all the tyrants of Europe and proclaiming their own liberty. [the newspaper clipping ends here]
<br>Citizens Cremer and Dutton also gave notice of the following series of resolutions: [here another clipping from the same issue of The Commonwealth is pasted into the Minute Book.]
<br>1. That the war now being waged in Europe between the Prussian and Austrian governments is a war for Empire, and as such is not calculated to benefit the peoples, as whichever becomes the victor it will be but the substitution of one despot for another.
<br>2. The Council regrets that the Prussian people should have allowed their energies to be diverted from the extension and consolidation of their liberties by the war policy of Bismarck who has thereby succeeded in rivetting still stronger their political fetters.
<br>3. The Council also expresses a hope that the Italian people, while endeavouring to give liberty to the Venetians, will not enter into an unholy alliance with the Prussian Government, and so be guilty of moral and political suicide by at the same time fighting to rescue the Venetians and assisting the Prussian Government to enslave the German people.
<br>4. That as all wars not waged on behalf of liberty and justice are cruel and unjustifiable, we therefore recommend the peoples of Europe to abstain from taking any active part in the present unrighteous struggle.
<br>Citizen <em>Fox</em> gave notice of the following resolution:
<br>That the Prussian Government is responsible for the miseries caused by the present war on the Continent.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> <br>The Council then adjourned to July 3rd.
<br>[unsigned. The last line is in Cremer's hand.]

In it Marx wrote: "Yesterday there was a discussion in the International Council on the present war. The question had been announced beforehand and our room was very crowded. The Italian gentry too had sent delegates. The discussion wound up, as was to be foreseen, with the 'question of nationality' in general and the attitude we take towards it. This subject was adjourned till next Tuesday.<br><br>"The French, who were numerously represented, gave vent to their cordial dislike of the Italians.<br><br>"Moreover, the representatives of 'Young France' (<em>non-workers</em>) came out with the announcement that all nationalities and even nations were 'antiquated prejudices'. Proudhonised Stirnerism. Everything is to be dissolved into small 'groups' or 'communes', which in turn are to form an 'association', but no state. And this 'individualisation' of humanity and the corresponding 'mutualism' are to go on while history comes to a stop in all other countries and the whole world waits until the French are ripe for a social revolution. Then they will demonstrate the experiment to us, and the rest of the world, overwhelmed by the force of their example, will follow suit. Exactly what Fourier expected of his model phalanstery. Anyhow, whoever encumbers the 'social' question with the 'superstitions' of the old world is a 'reactionary'.<br><br>"The English laughed very much when I began my speech by saying that our friend Lafargue and others, who had done away with nationalities, had spoken '<em>French'</em> to us, i.e., a language which nine-tenths of the audience did not understand. I also suggested that by the negation of nationalities he appeared, quite unconsciously, to understand their absorption by the model French nation.<br><br>"As for the rest the situation is difficult now, because on the one hand silly English Italianism and on the other the erroneous French polemics against it must be equally combated. In particular every demonstration that would involve our Association in a one-sided course must be prevented."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

Becker, dated July 4, 1866, Jung gives a more detailed account of his speech. He believed that the General Council should, considering the international situation at the time, intensify its activities, especially in London, to enlist the support of various workers' societies. This would enable it in the event of a revolution in Germany, or in any other country, to bring pressure to bear upon the British Government through mass meetings, and prevent it from siding with the counter-revolutionary governments, thereby helping the revolution on the Continent. Jung's speech met with objections on the part of the British members of the Council who held that the question of revolution had no relation to the questions under discussion. In his letter to Becker, Jung wrote that Marx had supported his viewpoint but wrote nothing further about Marx's speech.</span>

Following Marx's speech, the resolution submitted by Cremer and Dutton, which, although correct in its condemnation of wars of conquest, made no mention of the proletariat's paramount task — to organise the fight for their political and social emancipation — and Fox's resolution which suffered from the same shortcoming and, moreover, did not reflect the proletariat's attitude towards war, were withdrawn. The General Council unanimously adopted the Bobczynski-Carter resolution, after certain amendments had been introduced (see pp. 212-13 of the present volume).</span>

<p>Sir: It is some time since I sent you <a and="" href="MECW11-022.html" louis="" mazzini,="" napoleon"="" ossuth,="">an explanation</a> on my late correspondence respecting the <a and="" href="MECW11-015.html" kossuth.="" league="" louis="" mazzini="" napoleon.="" of="" ovements="" palmerston."="" with="">movements of Kossuth and Mazzini</a>, which caused such a noisy outburst from the American press. This explanation in which I stated, among other things, that Kossuth himself was a perfect stranger to the different articles called forth by my correspondence, and that my intention had been rather to give a warning, &amp;c., than to make an attack on the parties alluded to—was all I considered necessary to say on the subject, until I received the latest American newspapers containing a sort of official refutation of my remarks from the pen of a pretended Secretary of Mr. Kossuth. With regard to this "document," I have to inform you that Kossuth, on being referred to, has assured me:<b>1.</b> That, at the present time, he keeps no Secretary at all.<br><b>2.</b> That the said "refutation" had not been written by his authorization.<br><b>3.</b> That he had not even known of it before he received my communication.After this "authorized" declaration I shall recur no more to the subject, leaving to the uncalled-for advocates to console themselves for their ill-applied zeal.<br><i>Your Private Correspondent</i>

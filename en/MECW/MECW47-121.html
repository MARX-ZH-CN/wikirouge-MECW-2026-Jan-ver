ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY</p>
<p>IN ZURICH</p>
<p>[London,] 17 October 1884</p>
<p>Dietz tells me that the spelling has been changed.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>'Had Kautsky,' he writes, 'added a brief comment when sending the ms., you and I would have been spared the task of alteration.'</p>
<p>Not a word about the thing being kept quiet until 3 whole sheets had been printed (though this may not have been Dietz's fault).</p>
<p>Is old Bachofen still alive and is he still in Basle? I should like to inscribe a copy to him.</p>
<p>The preface<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> is in course of preparation, i.e. I am first of all ploughing through the whole of <i>Zur Erkenntniss</i><sup>b</sup> again. It will repay the trouble; only by a really close investigation does one properly appreciate the stupendousness of the nonsense preached here, nonsense that literally overwhelms the few flashes of insight which, though admittedly not new, are nevertheless accurate and, for Germany, commendable. <i>Capital,</i> Book II, will be <i>very</i> illuminating on this point. Regards to Ede.</p>

The book included, in place of Marx's preface, his article 'On Proudhon' (see present edition, Vol. 20) and two appendices: an excerpt from Marx's work <i>A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</i> on the theory of the English socialist John Gray (see present edition, Vol. 29, pp. 320-23), and a translation of the 'Speech on the Question of Free Trade' (Vol. 6).<br>At one time <i>Die Neue Zeit</i> was printed in a distinctive orthography proposed by Bruno Geiser.</span>

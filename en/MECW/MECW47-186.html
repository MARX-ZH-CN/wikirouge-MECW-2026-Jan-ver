ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>London, 23 July 1885</p>
<p>My dear Laura,</p>
<p>Very glad to learn that our prisoner<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>is going soon again to breathe <i>l'air pur de la liberté (sans égalité et fraternité)</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>and [...]<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Of course Deville is quite innocent of the trick of Hyndman and Co.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>— for it is said that the 'John Broadhouse' who figure-heads as translator, is the immortal Hyndman himself— and I hope the thing may blow over. Perhaps it was merely concocted between Hyndman and Kegan Paul to set us on, for Kegan Paul has not heard from me for a long time, considering that I cannot as yet fix a date when we shall be ready. At all events we cannot have anything about this pre- tended publication. Of course it would be best if it turned out a mere <i>Schreckschüsse</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>But if not, I am bound to declare publicly that the lat- ter half of the résumé does <i>not</i> render the original correctly. I told Deville so, before it was printed,<sup>6</sup> and yet it was printed in the old shape, 'because the publisher would not wait'. That could be al- lowed to pass unnoticed in France, where the French edition is in the market. But it will never do here, so long as there is no English translation out,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>or so long as it is brought out in competition to that.</p>
<p>The little squabble amongst the German deputies has on the whole had excellent effects. The workingmen have everywhere shown such an energetic front against these ridiculous pretensions that the big men in Parliament are not likely to repeat their attempt at domineer- ing.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>This our men have done in the most unmistakable way and in spite of all the trammels of the Socialist Law.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>In the meantime poor Liebknecht is hurrying from one end of Germany to the other preach- ing concord and telling everybody that there are no differences of principle, that it's all personal squabbles, that both sides have committed faults, etc.— the hen that has hatched ducklings. He has been hatching 'heducated' socialists for the last twenty years and now ob- stinately refuses to see that the chickens are ducklings, the socialists are philanthropic <i>Spiessburger.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Most happy am I to see that the <i>scrutin de liste</i><sup>5</sup> invented to per- petuate Opportunist government, is likely to smash up Opportunism altogether.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>If Clemenceau keeps only one half of what he prom- ises, if he merely <i>initiates</i> the break-up of the vast French bureaucracy, it will be an immense progress. On the other hand, even supposing him to really intend being sincere and a man of his word, he will find so many real obstacles, he will so soon be brought to a standstill, that to the Paris electors he will always appear as a traitor. It is a delusion to think that in France Anglo-Saxon, especially American local self- government can be introduced without upsetting the whole bourgeois régime. So, very soon he will have to choose: either drop his reforms and remain bourgeois <i>avec les bourgeois</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup>or go on and revolutionise himself. I think he will remain bourgeois, and then our time may come.</p>
<p>Schorlemmer is here, has as yet no definite projects for Continental tours, but keeps his mind's eye on Paris. He is out at present, may re- turn before I close this.</p>
<p>Here too we shall have a peaceable revolution in November. The new electorate is sure to change the whole basis of old parties.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup>The Whigs have already declared through their great mouthpiece <i>The Edinburgh Review</i> that there must be now 'a parting of the waters': the Radicals are to shift for themselves and the Whigs intend joining the Tories who, they find, are not so bad after all.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup>Whether the Tories will accept them, and on what terms, remains to be seen. The fact is that this alliance has been on the tapis for the last 10 years, but al- ways broke down on the question of the division of the spoil. Another progress: we shall very likely get all the rotten 'representative work- ing men' into Parliament. That is just the place where we want them.</p>
<p>Pumps wants us to go Jersey this year; if we do, and Paul is out, will you come and join us there, and then come over to London? Steamers from <i>St Malo</i> — or will you wait in Paris till Jollymeier comes and brings you over? You might ruminate that a bit and let me know. We cannot leave before 8th or 10th August on account of Percy's busi- ness.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Love from Nim and Jollymeier.</p>
<p>Yours affectionately,</p>
<p>F. Engels

Resume...</i> (see Note 81) in an English translation by John Broadhouse (Hyndman's pseudonym). At that time Engels was negotiating with the publish ers Kegan Paul and Co. about publishing the English translation of the first volume of<i> Capital</i> (see Note 56). These negotiations ended without success. Marx's work was put out by another publishing house and Deville's book did not appear in English.</span>

<li id="cite_note-6"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-6">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The idea of translating<i> Capital</i> into English occurred to Marx as early as 1865, when he was working on the manuscript (see Marx's letter to Engels of 31 July 1865, present edition, Vol. 42). The British journalist and member of the Interna tional's General Council, Peter Fox, was to help Marx find a publisher. However, this matter was not settled due to Fox's death in 1869. The English translation of the first volume of<i> Capital,</i> edited by Engels, did not appear until after Marx's death, in January 1887, and was published by Swan Sonnenschein, Lowrey &amp; Co., London. The translation was done by Samuel Moore and Edward Aveling between mid-1883 and March 1886. Eleanor Marx-Aveling took part in the preparatory work for the edition (see also this volume, pp. 33 and 127-28).</span>

<li id="cite_note-7"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-7">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The majority of the Social-Democratic group in the German Reichstag, consisting of reformists, tried to dispute the right of the party newspaper —<i> Der Sozialdemokrat</i>— to criticise the action of the parliamentary group and its attitude towards the bill envisaging the payment of subsidies to steamship companies (see Note 342). They published a statement to this effect in<i> Der Sozialdemokrat,</i> No. 14, 2 April 1885.<br>However, the majority of the local Social-Democratic organisations resolutely supported the editors. The reformists were virtually forced to renounce their objec tions and, in a joint statement with the editors<i> of Der Sozialdemokrat</i> published on 23 April, they recognised the newspaper's status as the<i> 'organ</i> of the whole party' (see also notes 380 and 390).</span>

<li id="cite_note-8"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-8">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The<i> Exceptional Law Against the Socialists</i> (Gesetz gegen die gemeingefährlichen Bestrebungen der Sozialdemokratie — the Law against the Harmful and Dan gerous Aspirations of Social Democracy) was introduced by the Bismarck govern ment, supported by the majority in the Reichstag, on 21 October 1878 to counter the socialist and workers' movement. This law, better known as the Anti-Socialist Law, made the Social-Democratic Party of Germany illegal, banned all party and mass workers' organisations, and the socialist and workers' press; on the basis of this law socialist literature was confiscated and Social Democrats subjected to reprisals. However, during its operation the Social-Democratic Party, assisted by Marx and Engels, uprooted both reformist and anarchist elements and managed to substan tially strengthen and widen its influence among the people by skilfully combining illegal and legal methods of work. Under pressure from the mass workers' move ment, the Anti-Socialist Law was abrogated on 1 October 1890. For Engels' assess ment of this law, see his article 'Bismarck and the German Working Men's Party' (present edition, Vol. 24, pp. 407-09).</span>

Suffrage was not extended to the poorer rural and urban sections of the population (tenants and domestic servants), nor to women. The first elections under the new electoral law took place in November- December 1885, with the electorate having a numerical strength of two million higher than at the previous poll (see Note 487).</span>

The author of the summary called on the Whigs to split with the Radi cal wing, describing this act as a 'watershed'.</span>

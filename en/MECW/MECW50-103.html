<p>IN COPENHAGEN</p>
<p>London, 31 July 1893
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Mr Petersen,</p>
<p>I am prevented from answering your letter of the 3rd inst. in detail since I will be leaving for the Continent tomorrow.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>After my return I will try and go into the questions you raise. Meanwhile thank you for sending those very interesting statistics.</p>
<p>Warmest greetings,</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. Engels

Bebel, went to Zurich via Mainz and Strassburg; thence he went to the Canton of Graubünden for several days to meet his brother Hermann. Upon his return to Zurich on 12 August, Engels attended the final session of the International Socialist Working-Men's Congress in Zurich (see Note 229), where he made a short speech in English, French and German (see present edi-tion,Vol. 27, pp. 404-05) and, on behalf of the Bureau, closed the session. After a fortnight's sojourn in Switzerland, Engels left for Vienna through Munich and Salzburg; in Vienna, on 14 September, he addressed a meeting of Social-Democrats (see present edition, Vol. 27, pp.406-07). Then, via Prague and Karlsbad (Karlovy Vary), he went to Berlin and stayed there from 16 September to 28 September; on 22 September he spoke at a Social-Democratic meeting (see present edition, Vol. 27, pp. 409-10). Thereupon Engels returned to London by way of Rotterdam.</span>

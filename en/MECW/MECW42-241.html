ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 15 August 1867</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>End. 3 £5-notes I/V 65551.,
, «.&lt;.• CFLII&lt;A Manchester " " " 44954J 2 9 January 1866</p>
<p>and the tax-slip returned. In <i>these</i> circumstances, it is <i>essential</i> that my return be kept a secret from Borkheim,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> so that I do not need to pay him until as late as possible in <i>September,</i> otherwise I shall be completely stuck, since you will understand that I too have a mass of payments to make here, especially in the new half-year. Furthermore, consequent upon the fall in the price of yarns, we are having to enter the stock in the accounts at approx. £2,500 less than by the prices which applied at the time of my departure. Which is not very pleasant either!</p>
<p>When do you wish to have some of the sheets returned? Schorlemmer asked me to pass them on to him a few at a time, as I finished with them, but that naturally depends on you. I have now read the thing through to the end (cursorily) and definitely think that the second volume is also <i>indispensable,</i> and the sooner you finish it, the better.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I am now looking through the whole thing again, i.e., the more theoretical aspects. The fellows will be astonished to see with what consummate ease the most difficult points, such as Ricardo's theory of profit, are dealt the <i>coup de grâce</i> here in this way.</p>
<p>Kindest regards to your wife.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p>Lupus was born in Tarnau<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> on 21 June 1809, died 9 May 1864.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </p>

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">According to the arrangement with the publisher that Marx mentions in his letter, he planned after the publication of Volume One of <i>Capital</i> (appeared in September 1867) to publish Book Two and Book Three as Volume Two, and Book Four, which contained a critical history of economic theories, as a concluding Volume Three. After Marx's death, Engels prepared for the press and published manuscripts belonging to Book Two and Book Three as Volumes Two and Three of <i>Capital;</i> he died before he could prepare for the press Book Four, <i>Theories of Surplus Value</i> (Volume Four of <i>Capital</i>) and have it published (see also Note 227).</span>

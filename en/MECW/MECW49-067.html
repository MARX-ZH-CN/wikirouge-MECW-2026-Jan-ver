ENGELS TO HEINRICH SCHEU</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 27 January 1891 122 Regent's Park Road, N.W.</p>
<p>Dear Mr Scheu,</p>
<p>Please forgive me for having kept you waiting so long for a reply to your kind note of the 10th.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> But in the first place I have had an extremely urgent job to do, secondly, owing to appointments with doctors, the timing of which did not depend on me, I have virtually never been master of my own time and, thirdly, the weather has not, until quite recently, been propitious for photography.</p>
<p>I shall, I think, now be at your disposal — at any rate as from the day after tomorrow, especially if you are able to give me 12 or 24 hours' NOTICE. I thought I might again go to Debenham quite close by, but would go to anyone else you like (save for Mayall, who refused to take money from Marx, which makes it <i>genant</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> ) and I should be very glad if you were also to attend and yourself explain to the man what you want and how you want it.</p>
<p>With kind regards,</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>F. Engels

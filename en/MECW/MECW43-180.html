ENGELS TO MARX<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 6 April 1869</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Liebknecht has again had the good luck of fools. The vote of 6,500 against 4,500 was a tremendous defeat for Schweitzer,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> even if it was not a direct victory for Wilhelm. The <i>Kölner Zeitung</i> says that Schweitzer was frightfully dismayed, and though he had declared earlier that he would resign if any sort of considerable minority were to vote against him, he has taken a lot of care not to do so.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In any case, Schweitzer's campaign for the kingdom of the tailors has failed, and his position in his own association has been shaken severely. <i>N'est pas dictateur qui veut.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> The process of the disintegration of specific Lassalleanism has thus begun, and is bound to continue rapidly. The figures 6,500:4,500 mean either a split or abandonment of the 'strict' organisation and Schweitzer's personal leadership. So far Liebknecht's foolhardiness has had a good effect. And under <i>these</i> circumstances I shall not take it amiss that he has let himself in for a new armistice,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> although this is the third case between the two of them of 'cad's fighting, when ended, is very soon mended'.</p>
<p>The copies of <i>Zukunft</i> follow enclosed. Unfortunately, the Reichstag debate on industrial legislation is very poorly reported in them. There is nothing more comical than Schweitzer's lecture on the socialist demands, culminating in the declaration that he favours trades freedom<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> up to Wagener, Miquel et Co.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Simply childish babble. Best by far was <i>Bebel.</i></p>
<p>I am sending the B. Becker<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> to <i>Lessner</i> today. I hear that the latest <i>Fortnightly</i> has an article on it.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>I shall send you the <i>Zukunft</i> on Schweitzer and Liebknecht, and immediately if there is anything more in it; I assume that Liebknecht sent them a report straight away.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

Bebel and Liebknecht accused Schweitzer of having contacts with the Bismarck Government and of attempts to prevent the formation of a united workers' party in Germany. The congress showed that Schweitzer's authority had been undermined: 14 delegates representing 4,635 of the Association's members refused to give him a vote of confidence, while 42 delegates with 7,400 votes gave such a vote. The congress adopted a number of resolutions aimed at restricting Schweitzer's dictatorial powers and making the internal life of the Association more democratic: in addition to the President, it was to be headed by a board of twelve members and its seat was to be in Hamburg. A proposal was moved to convene a Social-Democratic congress in Germany with a view to 'founding a united organisation'. On Schweitzer's suggestion, it was resolved to establish closer contacts with the International to the extent permitted by the German law. In fact, however, the Association's leadership continued to pursue a sectarian policy and obstruct the affiliation of the Association with the International.</span>

ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Ryde, Friday, 18 September 1857</p>
<p>Dear Marx,</p>
<p>Your letter arrived yesterday afternoon, too late for me to get anything done for B. Moreover, I was in Portsmouth when the letter got here, so that more time was lost, otherwise I'd have been able to translate the Bern thing for you.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>You seem to be having bad weather; here it's persistently fine, only too hot; last week there was an occasional heavy shower, but apart from that it was fine and warm all the time. The climate here is really marvellous and the vegetation, except for things needing very hot sunshine, is so southern one might almost be in Naples. The hedges are laurel. I'm improving rapidly, the actual complaint is quite <i>over,</i> there's no longer a sign of inflamed glands and my one concern now is the process—admittedly a lengthy one—of patching up, getting the sores to heal, and putting on flesh and fat. Bathing does me a great deal of good and I find I can swim like a fish again—proof of how well my treatment is going. I've been to see Pieper at Bognor; quite a nice little place, but not a patch on Ryde; I wonder how long he'll stay there—he's lucky, but for that very reason his 'yeenius' is again reasserting itself; he attributes his luck to personal merit and already half fancies himself king of Bognor. He's coming over on Sunday and Steffen too, perhaps. I am going to Brighton SOMETIME NEXT WEEK and sailing from there to Jersey; Schramm is also going there,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>or so he writes. Why don't you slip down to Brighton and, if it can be fitted in with the work, come to Jersey too? Anyhow the sea-trip would do you good. What do you think? I shall stay here until Tuesday at any rate, perhaps even longer: <i>je verrai<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></i></p>
<p>As to Bern, all I should say is this: *At the battle of Iganin, where he commanded the artillery, he was noticed for the skill and perseverance with which he fought it against the superior Russian batteries. At Ostrolenka, he again commanded the artillery in this capacity<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>; when the Polish army had been finally repulsed in its attacks against the Russians who had passed the Narev, he covered the retreat by a bold advance with the whole of his guns.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>He was now created colonel, soon after general and called to the command in chief of the whole Polish artillery. When the Russians assaulted the entrenchments of Warsaw and took Wola, Bern advanced with forty guns against this, the principal work of the whole line, but the superior force of Russian artillery opposed to him prevented the Polish infantry from returning to the assault and compelled Bern to retire.*<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The other matters are quite trivial. I have no material to hand about Iganin; it was a quite unimportant engagement, the defence of a dam, rendered fruitless as usual by an outflanking move- ment—the 40 cannon of <i>heavy</i> calibre are certainly a figment, likewise the Russian <i>retreat</i> at Ostrolenka, which can only have referred to <i>tirailleurs</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>and <i>soutiens,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>or a couple of exposed battalions. What I have said above puts the thing in the most favourable light, for Diebitsch <i>forbade</i> any pursuit.</p>
<p>Many thanks for the thing on bridges.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>Wholly adequate. On Sunday or Monday I shall be sending you 'Battle', 'Battery' and any other B's I have finished, and then get on smartly with the remainder. I shall also let you have something on Blücher one of these days, as soon as I've read through Miif- fling.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Which French generals and which of their exploits do you wish me to investigate more particularly? Allow me as much time as possible since I can't work very well for more than 2 hours at a stretch.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

In 1852 he went to the USA hoping to earn a living and improve his health. In the summer of 1857 he returned to London and, his condition having worsened, he was immediately placed in a hospital for German refugees. On 20 September he moved to Jersey where Engels too soon came for treatment. Schramm died on 15 January 1858.—158, 171, 312</span>

The majority of its participants were revolutionary gentry<i> (srdachta)</i> and its leaders came mostly from the aristocracy. It was suppressed by the Russian army with the support of Prussia and Austria.  At the<i> battle of Iganin</i> on 10 May 1831 the Polish insurgents were victorious in a clash with Russian troops.  At the<i> battle of Ostrolenka</i> on 26 May 1831 the Polish insurgents were defeated by Russian forces under Dibich. The final blow was delivered when the Russians captured Warsaw (see below) after storming its suburb Vola on 6 September. The remnants of the insurgent army fled to Prussia and Austria.—169, 172</span>

MARX TO PYOTR LAVROV</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 18 June 1875</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p>When I visited you the day before yesterday I forgot to tell you an important piece of news of which you may not yet be aware. Traube, a Berlin physiologist, has succeeded in making artificial cells.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Needless to say, they are not completely natural cells, being without a nucleus.</p>
<p>If a colloidal solution, e.g. of gelatine, is combined with copper sulphate, etc., this produces globules surrounded by a membrane that can be made to grow by intussusception. Here, then, membrane formation and cell growth have left the realm of hypothesis! It marks a great step forward, the more so since Helmholtz and others were engaged in disseminating the absurd doctrine that the germs of terrestrial life fall ready-made from the moon, i.e. that they were brought down here by aerolites.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I detest the kind of explanation which solves a problem by consigning it to some other locality.</p>
<p>The trade crisis goes on. Everything now depends on the news that will arrive from the Asiatic markets which, for years, have been getting increasingly overstocked — especially those in East Indies. Under certain conditions, which are, however, not likely to materialise, the final crash may yet be delayed until the autumn.</p>
<p>One truly remarkable phenomenon is the decrease in the number of years between general crises. I have always regarded that number not as a constant, but as a decreasing magnitude; what is pleasing, however, is that the signs of its decrease are so palpable as to augur ill for the survival of the bourgeois world.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>My compliments to Mrs and Mr Noel.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>K. M.

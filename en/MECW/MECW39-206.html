MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 9 February 1854
28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>DEAR Frederic,</p>
<p>I shall be sending you today, at the same time as this, a few copies of the 'Knight'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>and three copies of the 2nd edition of the Polish rubbish,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>which I have corrected. Give one copy of each to Lupus and Dronke. It was stupid of me not to have corrected the printing errors (Weydemeyer also contributes his fair share) in the Syrian Palmerston thing<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>before sending it to you.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>I had a meeting with Urquhart.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>He surprised me with the compliment that the articles read as though written by a 'Turk', an opinion in which he was in no way confirmed when I told him that I was a 'REVOLUTIONIST'. He is an utter maniac. Is firmly convinced THAT HE WILL ONE DAY BE PREMIER of England. When everyone else is downtrodden, England will come to him and say: SAVE US, Urquhart! AND THEN HE WILL SAVE HER. While speaking, particularly if contradicted, he goes into FITS which I find all the more comical as I know by heart his every platitude and quotation. This made me regard his 'FITS' as EVEN somewhat SUSPECT and RATHER as a theatrical EXHIBITION. The fellow's most comical idea is this: Russia rules the world through having a specific superfluity of BRAIN. TO COPE WITH HER, a man must have the BRAIN of an Urquhart and, if one has the misfortune not to be Urquhart himself, one should at least be an Urquhartite, i.e. believe what Urquhart believes, his 'metaphysics', his 'POLITICAL ECONOMY' etc., etc. One should have been in the 'EAST', or at least have absorbed the Turkish 'spirit', etc.</p>
<p>If you can do something by Tuesday,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>it would be very welcome, since I have to write to the Cape of Good Hope on <i>the same</i> day.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

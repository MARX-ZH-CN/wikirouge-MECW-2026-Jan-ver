ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 26 November 1867</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>I have not received the promised letter <i>in quo tua res agebatur.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Meissner's proposal to send out new notices with excerpts from the reviews was what I had in mind to suggest to you as soon as Siebel's articles (i.e. the ones I gave him<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> ) appear. The excerpt from the <i>Zukunft</i> is quite good,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> but a few more would be even better; he should send you the whole caboodle, and you can then prepare a notice from it. Or if you do not wish to, then he can send it to <i>me</i> and I will do it. I was most struck by the fact that the first notice <i>took up precisely the same space</i> as the one for my little pamphlet,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> and it had not a word of commentary with it.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>If the matter does not turn out differently soon, then I shall have to write—with your consent OF COURSE—to Meissner and offer him articles written by <i>myself</i> for newspapers to be specified by him. I am sure that could not compromise you.</p>
<p>I have just managed to convey Meissner's excuses to Siebel<sup>1S1</sup> before the post office closed. They are admittedly persuasive, Siebel was at the time AT A VERY LOW EBB and only recovered in Honnef.</p>
<p>You will have received my letter of Sunday with the returned letters. The tanner<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> returned enclosed, <i>autodidactum integrum,</i> which does not, however, mean that other nations are incapable of bringing forth such a tanner. Philosophy, which in Jakob Böhme's day was just a shoemaker, is making progress when it assumes the shape of a tanner.</p>
<p>How is the carbuncle? I do not like its location, I hope Lafargue has lanced it for you. A stop really must be put to this business.</p>
<p>Has Borkheim paid you the money? He has not written a word to me, although I am guarantor.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

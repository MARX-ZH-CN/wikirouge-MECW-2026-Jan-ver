<br>Dear Mr Bernays,
<br>The fee due to you for your manuscript — 500 fr. — will be paid at the end of the month.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> In accordance with the contract with the bookseller-publisher, debts are not payable until after publication of the manuscripts.
<br>I have the honour to be, sir,<br>Your obedient servant<br>Dr Charles Marx

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">A reference to the fee due to Bernays for an article which seems to have been an extract from his manuscript on crimes and criminal law, then being prepared for printing by the publisher Leske but was demanded back by the author because of careless typesetting. Marx wanted to include this article in the quarterly journal the planned publication of which was discussed with Westphalian publishers in 1845 and 1846. Thanks to Marx's mediation, Bernays, who was in need of money, received two advances on his article. But as the planned publication of the quarterly did not take place, Bernays' work, in the form he had conceived it, was not published.</span>

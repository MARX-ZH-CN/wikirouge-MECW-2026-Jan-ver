ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 16 August 1865</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>That unctuous trash from the Hatzfeldt woman<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> really is unctuous trash with all that is in it about Lassalle the only saviour, Liebknecht, etc. Dear old LIBRARY<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> has really surpassed himself this time in his customary spinelessness, lack of imagination and forgetfulness, that is, unless the whole report is a fabrication. The devil take such an advocatus.</p>
<p>Ditto our sparkling-wine enthusiast Siebold. With what self-assured naivety the fellow tried to 'reconcile' you to Blind!<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> And then those interesting 'old Swedes' whom nobody has ever heard of and whom we're supposed to write to, to make 'contact'. Quite <i>à la</i> Harro Harring. I'm increasingly coming round to think that from the most southerly latitude of North Friesland onwards everything beyond urban bourgeois and peasant politics is pure Harro Harring.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> But no doubt you will be having that dolt on your back every year.</p>
<p>Next week (about Friday 25th inst.) Moore and I are going to Germany and Switzerland for a fortnight, and maybe we shall also 'cast a casual glance' over Italy.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> If I can so arrange it, I shall call in briefly at Modena Villas<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> on my way back.</p>
<p>The 28th of this month, i.e. Monday week, is the date of the General Meeting of the Cologne-Minden shareholders, which will decide Prussia's politics for the next few years. I can't imagine that those fellows will be such jackasses as to pay out 13 mill. talers in cash to Bismarck without having the approval of the Chambers.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>But your liberal Rhineland burgher is capable of a good many tricks the moment he has a chance of swindling the state, and thinks that in his capacity as Deputy he can obtain indemnity for himself afterwards. But if the deal were to fall through, or if it were made conditional on authorisation by the Chambers, that would be more or less the end for Monsieur Bismarck; even that adventurer would not survive such a defeat <i>in financialibus</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> and after such a desperate attempt. But the fact that he is momentarily coming to terms with Austria again, shows that intellectually and morally he is <i>au bout de son latin.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> He knows only too well that he can't start a war without being brought down immediately, so he goes on lashing out with big talk, chalking up little gains and turning Germany into the laughing stock of the world. But the philistine is almost as much impressed by him as by Boustrapa.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The philistine now no longer requires even ephemeral victories from his idols, but only that they can brag. This is how Classen-Kappelmann became the idol of Cologne as well, because he took to his heels at the crucial moment.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>It was also a nice thought of Siebold's to put in a good word for C. V. Rimestad in Copenhagen, who is one of the <i>Dagbladet</i> people! The so-called Workers' Association is a propaganda organisation of the Scandinavian Eider-Danes and the Hall ministry.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>What will Father Urquhart be saying next month about the legal advisers to the Prussian throne? What splendid lads they are!</p>
<p>Kindest regards to the LADIES<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> and Edgar.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

It granted the Company's Board the right to buy up its shares which until then belonged to the government alone. This deal placed a considerable sum of money at the disposal of the Bismarck government. The agreement was to be ratified by the Prussian Provincial Diet, but on 28 August the shareholders' general meeting unanimously approved it without the Diet's ratification.</span>

On 17 July the Bismarck government forbade the banquet. Despite numerous protests on the part of the workers in the various towns of Germany against this arbitrary measure, most opposition members did not dare to show open resistance. Only some 80 delegates out of the 250 invited arrived in Cologne. The banquet's organiser, Classen-Kappelmann, fearing arrest, left for Belgium. Since the hall where the banquet was to take place had been closed by the police, the deputies tried to hold the banquet in the Zoological Gardens, but were driven out of it by soldiers and policemen.</span>

<li id="cite_note-12"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-12">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Returning to Siebold's letter TO MARX, Engels criticises his proposal to establish contacts with the Copenhagen Workers' Association (see Note 239). This Association was under the influence of the Danish liberal party (Eider-Danes) which advanced the slogan 'Denmark up to the Eider'. The Eider-Danes demanded that the Duchy of Schleswig, populated mainly by Germans and separated from other German regions by the Eider river, should be united with Denmark. Schleswig and Holstein were at the time when the letter was written under the joint rule of Prussia and Austria (see Note 9).</span>

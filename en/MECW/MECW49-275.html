ENGELS TO VICTOR ADLER</p>
<p>IN VIENNA</p>
<p>London, 27 September 1892</p>
<p>Dear Victor,</p>
<p>Barely had my (registered) letter gone off yesterday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> than a messenger arrived from the Crédit Lyonnais<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and handed me the £15 in question in settlement of my loan. Receipt of this is hereby gratefully acknowledged.</p>
<p>The Marseilles Trades Unions <i>(syndicats)</i> Congress,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> which <i>preceded</i> the one held by the Workers' Party,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> resolved <i>not</i> to send delegates to the Eight Hours Congress in Glasgow<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> convoked by the TRADES UNIONS, but instead to invite the TRADES UNIONS to Zurich. Lafargue writes to say that the party congress will pass a similar resolution. Were your trades unions to make a pronouncement along the same lines, it would create an impression over here. In the eyes of the bumptious gentlemen of the <i>old</i> TRADES UNIONS, resolutions adopted by <i>political</i> working men's congresses don't count!</p>
<p>Regards from Louise to your wife<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> and children and yourself, and likewise from</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F.E.

The congress resolved to stay away from the international congress on the eight-hour working day called by the British trades unions and instead invite their representatives to the 1893 International Socialist Workers' Congress in Zurich (see Note 541).</span>

<li id="cite_note-4"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-4">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The tenth congress of the French Workers' Party was held in Marseilles from 24 to 28 September 1892. It discussed the party's position and activities, in particular its work in the countryside, the celebration of May Day, the party's participation in the International Socialist Workers' Congress in Zurich in 1893 (see Note 541) and in the forthcoming parliamentary elections, and other matters. The congress adopted an agrarian programme which contained a number of specific demands reflecting the interests of the farm labourers and small peasants. The congress decided against the party's participation in the international congress called by the British trades unions to discuss the eight-hour working day (see Note 540) and for inviting British trade unionists to the Zurich Congress.</span>

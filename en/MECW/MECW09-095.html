<p><em>Cologne,</em> April 27. Today is <em>Kossuth's birthday;</em> the leader of the Hungarian revolution is 43 years old today.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Today an <em>official</em> royal imperial <em>Bulletin</em> (No. 35) already confirms the reports of Hungarian advances which we published this morning: that Wohlgemuth has been defeated, Pest and Ofen are taken, and Komorn is relieved. It is now established that the Hungarians have already passed not only the Gran and the Neutra but even the <em>Waag</em>, and that Wohlgemuth has been <em>driven back to Tyrnau</em>, five miles from Pressburg. Altogether <em>only four comitats</em> in Hungary are <em>still</em> in imperial hands, and on all sides it is conceded that <em>on Hungarian soil not a single defensible position is left to the imperial forces</em>.</p>
<p><em>Great excitement</em> prevails in <em>Vienna.</em> The people throng the streets as in the revolutionary days of last year. The military, usually so impudent, have again become remarkably restrained. Vienna is waiting for the Hungarians to cross the Leitha to effect its <em>fifth revolution,</em> <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> a revolution which will not be simply an Austrian, but simultaneously a European one.</p>
<p><em>Eljen Kossuth! Eljenek a Magyarak!</em>

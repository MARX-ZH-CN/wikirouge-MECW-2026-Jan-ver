ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH LESSNER
<br>IN LONDON
<br>London, Wednesday [16 October 1872]
<br>Dear Lessner,
<br>Would you please give the enclosed letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> to the Secretary of the FEDERAL COUNCIL tomorrow evening. If Hales then insists that it is necessary to write to Lisbon direct, without going through me, it would be best if you were to say no more than this: the matter should be <i>dealt with speedily</i> and so the best course to take would be to reply to me without delay; if Hales still wanted to discuss formalities and personalities, this would only show that he did not want any <i>real work</i> to be done, but merely wanted to waste the time of the FEDERAL COUNCIL and to sacrifice the interests of the Portuguese workers to his personal intrigues. If they demand that I should give them the Lisbon address, it would be best to say nothing for the time being; it will all work out.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

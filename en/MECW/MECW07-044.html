<p><em>Cologne,</em> June 24, 10 p.m. Letters of the 23rd from Paris have failed to arrive. A courier who has passed through Cologne has told us that when he left fighting had broken out in Paris between the people and the national guard,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and that he had heard heavy cannon-fire at some distance from Paris.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> </p>

It was hostile towards the insurgents and misrepresented their conflict with the Minister of Public Works, Marie, a moderate republican and spokesman of the Government. For this reason the <em>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</em>'s report ended with a warning: "It should not he forgotten that the <em>Journal des Débats,</em> which printed this report, is an old Court sheet and Marie is an advocate of the law against street gatherings and the man of the <em>National</em></span>

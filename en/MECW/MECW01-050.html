<blockquote>
<br>The <i>Plan of Hegel's Philosophy of Nature</i> consists of brief notes on the content of those paragraphs of Hegel's work <i>Encyclopedie der philophischen Wissewchaftem in Grundrisse</i>, 3 Aufl., Heidelberg, 1830, which deal with the philosophy of nature. These notes were made by Marx in 1839 in three versions on five pages of the sixth notebook. The first version covers 5§ 252-334 of Hegel's book and most closely reproduces the order in which Hegel sets forth his material. Marx departs from Hegel's terminology here only in separate cases. The second version covers fewer paragraphs dealing with the philosophy of nature but it is marked by greater independence in systematising the material and in terminology. Most original in this respect is the third version, which, though brief, expounds the contents of Hegel's philosophy of nature more fully than the previous ones. (Note from MECW, 1975)

<center>
<br>[First Version]

</center><br>A. General divisions. The Idea as nature is:
<br>I) In the determination of juxtaposition, of abstract singularisation, outside which is the unity of form, this as merely an ideal being-in-self, matter and its ideal system.
<br>Mechanics. Universal nature.
<br>II) In the determination of particularity, so that reality is posited with immanent determinateness of form and the difference existing in it, a relation of reflexion the being-within-itself of which is natural individuality.
<br>
Ill) Singular nature. T h e determination of subjectivity, in which the real distinctions of the form are likewise brought back to ideal unity, which is self-found and for itself—Organics.<center>
<br>I. Mechanics

</center><center>
<br>A) Abstract Universal Mechanics 

</center><br>a) Space. Immediate continuity; as external are: 
<ul><li>α) The dimensions: height, length and breadth.</li>
<li>β) Point, line and surface: on the one hand, a determinateness in regard to line and point; on the other hand, as restoration of the spatial totality: an enclosing surface which separates off an individual whole space.</li></ul>
<br>b) Time. Immediate discreteness: T h e seen becoming: present, future and past (Now, etc.)
<br>
c) T h e immediate unity of space and time, in the determination of space. Place, in the determination of time—motion, their unity — matter.<center>
<br>B) Particular Mechanics. Matter, Motion Repulsion—Attraction — Gravity

</center><br>1) Inert matter, mass, ... as content indifferent to the form of space and time.
<br>External motion — inert matter.
<br>2) Impact. Communication of motion—weight—velocity—external centre, rest, centripetence—pressure.
<br>3) Falling. Centrifugence.

<center>
<br>C) Absolute Mechanics or Narrower Mechanics.
<br>Gravitation. Motion as a System of Several Bodies. 
<br>Universal Centre — Centreless Singularity. Particular Centres.

</center><center>
<br>II. Physics

</center><br>a) Universality in physics.
<ul><li>1) Universal bodies. Identity.
<ul><li>α) Light (sun, stars). Darkness (smooth) (spatial relation—direct).</li>
<li>β) Bodies of opposition. Darkness
<ul><li>1) as corporeal diversity, rigidity, material being-for-itself.</li>
<li>2) Opposition as such. Dissolution and neutrafity of lunar and cometary bodies.</li></ul></li>
<li>𝛾) Bodies of individuality. Earth or planet in general.</li></ul></li></ul>
<ul><li>2) Particular bodies. Elements.
<ul><li>1) Air, negative universality.</li>
<li>2) Elements of opposition. Fire and water.</li>
<li>3) Individual element, terrestriality, earth.</li></ul></li>
<li>3) Singularity. The elementary process. The meteorological process.
<ul><li>1) Diremption of individual identity into the moments of independent opposition, into rigidity and into selfless neutrality.</li>
<li>2) The consumption by spontaneous combustion of attempted differentiated existence. Thus the earth became a real and fruitful individuality.</li></ul></li></ul>
<br>b) Physics of particular individuality.

<ul><li>α) Specific gravity. Density of matter. Ratio of weight of mass to volume.</li>
<li>β) Cohesion, seen as a specific form of resistance in mechanical behaviour towards other masses.  Adhesion—cohesion, etc.  Elasticity.</li>
<li>𝛾) Sound.</li>
<li>δ) Heat. (Specific heat-capacity.)</li></ul>
<br>c) Physics of singular individuality.

<ul><li>a) Form.
<ul><li>α) Immediate form—the extreme of pointedness of brittleness, the extreme of coagulating fluidity.</li>
<li>β) The brittle disclosed into difference of the notion.  Magnetism.</li>
<li>𝛾) Activity which has passed into its product, the crystal.</li></ul></li>
<li>b) Particular form.
<ul><li>α) Relation to light.
<ul><li>1) Transparency.</li>
<li>2) Refraction. (Internal equalisation in the crystal.)</li>
<li>3) Brittleness as darkening, metallity (colour).</li></ul></li>
<li>ß) Relation to fire and water. Smell and taste.</li>
<li>𝛾) Totality in particular individuality. Electricity.</li></ul></li>
<li>c) Chemical process.
<ul><li>1) Combination.
<ul><li>α) Galvanism. Metals, oxidation, deoxidation.</li>
<li>β) The fire process.</li>
<li>𝛾) Neutralisation. The water process.</li>
<li>δ) The process in its totality. Elective affinity.</li></ul></li>
<li>2) Separation.</li></ul></li></ul>

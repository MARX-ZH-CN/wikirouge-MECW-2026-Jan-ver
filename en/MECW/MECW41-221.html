MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London, about 6 June 1862]</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>You will forgive me for not acknowledging the <i>£2</i> before now. During the past week, I have been so BOTHERED that I couldn't find time. The LANDLORD and half a dozen other monsters kept me</p>
<p>RUNNING.</p>
<p>Herewith 2 COPIES of the Lassalle<sup>3</sup> (1 for you, 1 for Lupus). Write and tell me what you think of it.</p>
<p>Have had a letter from Steffen, will send it to you within the next few days, as soon as I've answered it. He is in Boston. Seems very much depressed. Weydemeyer is a LIEUTENANT COLONEL.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

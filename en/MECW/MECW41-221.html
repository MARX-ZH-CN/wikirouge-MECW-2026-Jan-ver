MARX TO ENGELS
<br>IN MANCHESTER
<br>[London, about 6 June 1862]
<br>Dear Engels,
<br>You will forgive me for not acknowledging the <i>£2</i> before now. During the past week, I have been so BOTHERED that I couldn't find time. The LANDLORD and half a dozen other monsters kept me
<br>RUNNING.
<br>Herewith 2 COPIES of the Lassalle<sup>3</sup> (1 for you, 1 for Lupus). Write and tell me what you think of it.
<br>Have had a letter from Steffen, will send it to you within the next few days, as soon as I've answered it. He is in Boston. Seems very much depressed. Weydemeyer is a LIEUTENANT COLONEL.
<br><i>Salut.</i>
<br>Your
<br>K. M.

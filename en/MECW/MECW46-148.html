MARX TO JENNY LONGUET
<br>IN ARGENTEUIL
<br>[Postcard]
<br>Monte Carlo, 26 May 1882<br>
Hôtel de Russie
<br>Dearest Child,
<br>I am always happy to receive a letter from you, though regretting that your Old Nick steals some time of your night's rest.
<br>My health is improving with the weather; possibly I shall perhaps at the beginning of June go to Cannes, and remain there for a week or so. Everything depends of medical advice, and the character of the summer opening in June.
<br>[As to] Lafargue's (I mean the <i>man's of Cuba</i>) paper<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> has committed great blunders, mostly from ignorance, and the childish aspiration 'to go as far as possible'.
<br>As to the <i>Bataille,</i> I have seen till now not anything brilliant. In fact I do know it only to No. 4; but I will have always the time to see that!
<br>My heart is with you and the children; I yearn for them. However, I shall, after a series of most disagreeable 'medical' experiments, precipitate nothing. With all that, I hope to be soon with them.
<br>Your
<br>Old Nick

ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 24 June 1863</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>I have absolutely no idea what the little BUSYBODY<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> wants. Why doesn't he write and tell me that he wants the matter settled <i>now?</i> He wrote and told <i>me</i> that, <i>if I didn't reply,</i> he would draw on me as arranged. So far as I'm concerned, if a matter is settled, it's settled and I therefore thought it totally unnecessary to send him another written assurance a fortnight before the date stating that I would do what I had already undertaken to do, both verbally and in writing. Basing myself on <i>your</i> letter, which casts quite a different light on his motives, I have now written to him as requested.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> My acceptance will be for £250. Make sure he sends you the <i>whole amount,</i> since he has undertaken to pay the expenses and interest himself.</p>
<p>Have finished Kinglake.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Never before has there been anything as superficial (though some of the material is very good, if scrappy), stupid and ignorant as his Battle of the Alma. Only <i>la part des français</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> is well and accurately depicted—in general, at least. Otherwise, much that is highly amusing to the military reader.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Things are going rottenly in Poland. The Polish government's grand effect, the mass uprising in June, has obviously come to grief<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> owing to a shortage of weapons and, failing any external imbroglios, a gradual decline is now inevitable.</p>
<p>Your policy in regard to Izzy is quite right. Besides, what's the use of all this camaraderie towards a chap who either finds himself compelled by circumstances to go along with us at a crucial moment, or else openly becomes our enemy. To allow the fool to steal one's ideas for years on end and be rewarded for it by having to answer for all his stupidities—that's a bit too much.</p>
<p>Someone has sent for me.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

One of the slogans of the new National Government, composed of moderate 'Reds' (see Note 516), was the formation of a universal militia with a view to enrolling the peasant masses in the guerrilla struggle. However, within ten days the 'Whites' reasserted themselves in the National Government. Reluctant openly to reject the popular slogan of a universal militia they 'postponed' its implementation indefinitely. As a result, the insurrection remained fragmented and failed to assume nationwide proportions.</span>

<p><em>Berlin</em>, August 19. I am writing to you today to report that there is really nothing to report from here. Heaven knows, it is now the silly season or gherkin time, as they say here. Nothing is happening, absolutely nothing! The Union of the Historical Christ gives no more signs of life than the Union of the Free <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> ; although officially it exists, no student really knows where it exists or who belongs to it. It is probably the same as with the famous torchlight procession six months ago for the philosopher in the Leipziger Strasse, <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> in which, too, no student would afterwards admit having taken part, and of which it was already said the day before that they were unfortunately mostly "philistines". The Commissions of the Estates have not yet materialised either, in spite of the <em>Leipziger Zeitung</em> which, with its passion for unhatched Prussian eggs, conducts interminable debates on whatever is to be placed before the Commissions. <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> But we console ourselves with the wisdom of our King, b and leave the unhatched eggs in peace. He is said to have brought with him a trade treaty and a new cartel convention, and that will certainly not be unhatched eggs! Far from bothering about that, we — I mean we Berliners — envy the Rhinelanders the great enjoyment that will be theirs in a few weeks, when not only our King, but many other persons of high rank, including the worthy King Ludwig of Bavaria, the poet on the throne, author of <em>Walhallagenossen</em> and founder of Valhalla, <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> will attend the laying of the foundation stone of Cologne Cathedral, which is to be completed as an ornament for the German people. The <em>Walhallagenossen</em> caused a lively sensation in local educated circles, and the general, competent judgment pronounces without qualification that King Ludwig has added a new laurel branch to his crown. Terse as Tacitus', strong and elementally forceful, the King's style can be confident of imitation and yet will only rarely be equalled.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">"The Free"-the Berlin group of Young Hegelians which was formed in the first half of 1842 and was led by Edgar Bauer, Eduard Meyen, Ludwig Buhl and Max Stirner (pseudonym of Caspar Schmidt). Its members advocated radical and atheistic views and condemned the half-heartedness of liberalism.

The fact that "The Free" lacked any positive programme and ignored the realities of political struggle soon led to differences between them and the representatives of the revolutionary-democratic wing of the German opposition movement. A sharp conflict arose between "The Free" and Marx in the autumn — of 1842, after Marx had become editor of the Rheinische Zeitung (see MECW, Vol. 1, pp. 393-95).

During his stay in Berlin Engels associated closely with "The Free" but, unlike many of them, he held that it was necessary to go beyond purely atheistic propaganda and take part in the actual struggle for political liberties and democracy. Engels' revolutionary-democratic convictions, which found expression in the satirical poem <i>The Insolently Threatened Yet Miraculously Rescued Bible,</i> together with his developing materialistic outlook, led to his parting company with "The Free" and the Young Hegelian trend in general.</span>

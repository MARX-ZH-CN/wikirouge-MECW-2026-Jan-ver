MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN RAMSGATE</p>
<p>[London,] 4 August 1874</p>
<p>DEAR FRED, Jennychen will join you the day after tomorrow; she'll probably leave by the 12 a.m. train from Maitland Station, Kentish Town. I<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>My four referees, Manning, Matheson, Selon and Adcock, all assembled at the SOLICITORS at precisely 12 o'clock on Saturday; the various STATEMENTS before the MAGISTRATE were taken care of and the papers were delivered to the HOME OFFICE by the SOLICITOR the same day. He thinks that a decision can be expected this week.</p>

<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

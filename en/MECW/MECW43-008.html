MARX TO ENGELS
<br>IN MANCHESTER
<br>[London,] 18 April 1868
<br>DEAR FRED,
<br>I have been lying fallow until today and could not leave the house. My arm was so inflamed, and there was so much suppuration, that I could wear nothing on that arm and movement was upsetting, too. The suppuration has stopped completely this morning. The wounds themselves heal rapidly. I shall go out again today. With the help of arsenic I now hope that this disgusting muck is finished.
<br>The Viennese affairs enclosed were sent by Fox, who is also responsible for the pencil marks.
<br>On <i>Tuesday</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I have to pay £ 5 for school and £ 1 5s. for gymnastic classes for Tussy. If it is possible for you to send this <i>by return,</i> I would appreciate it very much, for the sake of the child.
<br>The departure is still a good way off. Kugelmann jumps to conclusions too rapidly. I only wrote to him that I would be coming SOME TIME OR OTHER.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>Becker's appeal, which is enclosed, demonstrates again the great lack of discipline. We stopped the collections in the London UNIONS, and the Parisians did the same, because it is <i>only now</i> that we are informed that further money is needed. If they had telegraphed from Geneva on the same day, it would have been ALL RIGHT.
<br><i>Salut.</i>
<br>Your
<br>K. M.

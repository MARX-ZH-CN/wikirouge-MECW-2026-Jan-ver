MARX TO SIBYLLE HESS</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>London, 29 November 1877<br>41 Maitland Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Mrs Hess,</p>
<p>Both I and Engels have been absent from London for some considerable time and, after returning, I necessarily had first to read our late friend's book,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>before being in a position to write to you.</p>
<p>Engels and I thank you very much for sending the same. In so far as we have any influence, we shall endeavour to disseminate it. It contains some brilliant notions but unfortunately—no doubt because Hess could not put the finishing touches to it—there are quite a number of dubious points that lend themselves to attack by professional natural scientists.</p>
<p>Wishing you the best of success, I remain</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

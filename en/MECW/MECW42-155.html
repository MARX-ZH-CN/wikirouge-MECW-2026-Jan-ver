<p>Dear Friend</p>
<p>I shall return to London the day after tomorrow. My doctor exiled me to this seaside place,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>where indeed my health has <i>greatly improved</i>. But once again more than two months – February, March and half of April – have been entirely lost and the completion of my book again postponed. It is enough to drive one mad.</p>
<p>I was suffering from carbuncles, not furuncles. This time it was dangerous. Of course you are right in saying that 'dietetic' sins are at the bottom of it. I am too much given to working at night, studying by day and writing by night. That, together with all the worries, private and public, and – so long as I am working hard – the neglect of a regular diet and exercise, etc, is quite enough to disorder the blood.</p>
<p>I received Herr Menke's 100 thalers for the International together with your letter. I have not got the addresses of my French friends in Paris here, but if Herr Menke writes to my friend C Kaub<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>(33 <i>Rue des trois Couronnes du Temple</i>) he can introduce him to V Schily<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>(German) and Tolain,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>Fribourg,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>etc, members of the Paris Committee.</p>
<p>The news from Germany is not very gratifying. Prussia is being pushed by Russia (and Bonaparte), Austria by the latter (following more reluctantly in self-defence). Will our philistines at last realise that without a revolution which removes the Hapsburgs and Hohenzollerns (it is unnecessary to speak of the lesser dung-beetles) there must finally come another Thirty Years' War and a new partition of Germany!</p>
<p>A movement from the Italian side would help Prussia. But if we consider Austria and Prussia in themselves, it is practically certain that the latter would be at a disadvantage, despite all the <i>Düppel-Rénommage</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>In any case Benedek is a better general than Prince Friedrich Karl. Austria could enforce peace on Prussia single-handed, but not Prussia on Austria. Every Prussian success would be an encouragement to Bonaparte to interfere.</p>
<p>While I write these lines to you, Bismarck may have again drawn in his horns. But even that would only postpone the conflict. I think that such a postponement is probable.</p>
<p>This German trouble is a piece of extraordinary good luck for Bonaparte. His position is undermined on all sides. But war would give him a new lease of life.</p>
<p>Write to me soon, and particularly about German affairs.</p>
<p>Yours<br><b>KM</b>

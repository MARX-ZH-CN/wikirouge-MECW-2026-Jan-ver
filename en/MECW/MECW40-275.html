MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 13 August 1859</p>
<p>I received the enclosed note<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>on Thursday afternoon. I therefore hastened into town. Matters could only be arranged by my borrowing £4 from Garthe, which <i>will have to be returned.</i> On Monday I shall write to Borchardt. To abandon the paper now would seem to me foolish on several counts: 1. because this would save the now foundering <i>Gottfried</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>; 2. because after the King of Prussia's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>death there will be radical changes in Germany, when <i>we</i> must have a paper of our own; 3. because of the growing number of subscribers (although <i>for the time being</i> this is simply a disadvantage financially, since the cost in STAMPS increases weekly while payments aren't due until the <i>end of the quarter).</i> The <i>Volk</i> already wields considerable influence in the United States. For instance the preface to my book<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>has been reprinted from the</p>
<p><i>Volk</i> and variously commented on by German papers from New England to California.</p>
<p>You couldn't, I suppose, arrange to let me have your article<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>by Wednesday, there being nothing 'topical' about it this time?</p>
<p>Might it be possible to raise some money from German business employees in Manchester through your cousin Siebel?</p>
<p>I shall certainly succeed in getting some money out of Berlin and New York. But there's the next 6 to 8 weeks to be taken care of.</p>
<p>As TO Freiligrath, just come and TRY extracting one shilling from him if you can!</p>
<p>Incidentally, and between ourselves, we'd have done better over money if new deficits hadn't continually arisen as a result of renewed thefts. But these were perpetrated by the old agents. Beginning with Scherzer, I've thrown out <i>all</i> those who <i>had</i> compromised themselves. But what remained of the old leaven<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>wasn't any good and, even if these uncouth louts have been well-behaved hitherto, they blot their copybook when they make their <i>exit.</i> I finally threw out <i>the last</i> of them—Mr Lange—last week. It would have been relatively much easier to start up a completely new paper from scratch rather than, as Biskamp and</p>
<p>Liebknecht did, <i>continue,</i> if only nominally, the existence of an organ that was rotten through and through.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Herewith a letter from Dana. Though I don't think much of his POETRY, could your RELATIVE Siebel do some little piece of verse for the <i>Volk?</i> But nothing sublime, please! So as to nettle Freiligrath, we simply must unearth some poet or other, even if we have to write the verse for him ourselves.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>Copies of <i>Po and Rhine</i> next week.

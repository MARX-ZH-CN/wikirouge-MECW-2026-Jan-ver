MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>London, 27 October 1852
28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>I wrote and told you that I would compose a 'Lithographed Circular' about the 'Cologne trial'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>That 'L.

On 6 December a copy of the manuscript was sent to the publisher Schabelitz junior in Switzerland, and on the following day a second copy was dispatched to Cluss in the USA. The pamphlet was published in Basle in January 1853, but almost the whole edition (2,000 copies) was confiscated by the police in March in the Baden frontier village of Weill on the way to Germany. In the USA the work was first published in instalments in the democratic Boston Neu-England-Zeitung and at the end of April 1853 it was printed as a separate pamphlet by the same publishers</span>

ENGELS TO JENNY MARX (DAUGHTER)</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 17 March 1870</p>
<p>Dear Jenny,</p>
<p>I congratulate you on your well-earned success.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> That Mr Bruce had to stammer his apologies in yesterday's <i>Daily News</i> is priceless.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> It will now be necessary to show up the hollowness of these apologies, and that is not difficult. Here is some material, as I do not know whether you still have a copy of the <i>Pollock and Knox Report</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> about THINGS NOT GENERALLY KNOWN.</p>
<p>Bruce says:</p>
<p>'WITH REFERENCE TO THE COMPLAINT THAT HE WAS COMPELLED TO BATHE IN UNCLEAR BATHS, THE COMMISSIONERS, AFTER FULL INQUIRY INTO THE PRACTICE OF THE PRISON, SAY "IT WOULD BE IDLE TO DWELL UPON SUCH ABSURDITIES."'</p>
<p>What do the Commissioners say? PAGE 23:</p>
<p>'AT BATHING HOURS, HE STOOD NO. 1 OF A PARTY OF 30, <i>HE WAS NOT CALLED FIRST TO THE BATH.</i> IT TURNED OUT THAT THE WARDER IN CHARGE ON ONE OCCASION BEGAN WITH NO. 1, NEXT WEEK WITH No. 30; THE 3RD WEEK HE TOOK No. 16 AND 17 FIRST</p>
<p>AND WORKED ROUND TO THE FLANKS <i>SO AS TO GIVE EACH HIS PRIORITY,</i> WITHOUT WHICH THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN UNIVERSAL DISCONTENT. <i>IT WOULD BE IDLE TO DWELL ON SUCH ABSURDITIES'</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>THUS, THE ABSURDITY does not consist in fact that it is stated that Rossa<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> had to bathe in the dirty water of criminals. No, but <i>in the fact that he complains about it.</i> Bruce changes the fact (admitted by the COMMISSIONERS) in such a way as if they had treated it 'as an absurdity'. That's the way Bruce treats the truth.</p>
<p>On the fact itself, the CONVICT of Clonmel explains (THINGS NOT</p>
<p>GENERALLY KNOWN, p. 9).</p>
<p>'IT IS NOT GENERALLY KNOWN THAT WE HAD TO BATHE IN THE SAME WATER IN WHICH SEVERAL OF THESE CRIMINALS BATHED OR WERE BATHING AT THE TIME.'</p>
<p>I might further remark that PENAL SERVITUDE is similar to the French <i>travaux forcés</i> or the so-called <i>galères,</i> and a CONVICT PRISON of this sort = the French <i>bagne,</i> and CONVICT = <i>galérien.</i> The enclosed clipping is a LEADER from the local John Blight's paper.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> The <i>Manchester Guardian</i> also has a leader on the subject, aping that of yesterday's <i>Times,</i> but also with the comment that political prisoners have a claim to some CONSIDERATION.</p>
<p>Nota Bene: if you do not have the above report or the THINGS etc., I can send them to you immediately.</p>
<p>You should see the pleasure which this whole thing gave my wife. She is infinitely grateful to you for bringing all these infamies to light, and sends you the enclosed twig of SHAMROCK, for today is St Patrick's day and we don't know if you have any there.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> There is also a SHAMROCK for Tussy.</p>
<p>Give my affectionate greetings to Moor, your Mama, Tussy and Ellen.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. Engels

In this letter, Engels refers to the publication of the second article in <i>La Marseillaise</i> on 9 March 1870, which reproduced O'Donovan Rossa's letter about the harsh treatment of political prisoners in English prisons (O'Donovan Rossa was arrested in 1865). On 10 March, this letter was reprinted by <i>The Times</i> (on the publication of O'Donovan Rossa's letter, see also this volume, pp. 454-55).</span>

<li id="cite_note-7"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-7">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The <i>Schiller Institute,</i> founded in Manchester in November 1859 in connection with the centenary of Friedrich Schiller's birth, was conceived as a cultural and social centre of the city's German colony. At first Engels was critical of a society notorious for its tendency towards formalism and pedantry, and he kept aloof from it. But after certain amendments had been made to its Rules, he became a member of its Directorate in 1864, and later its President, devoting much time to it and exercising a considerable influence on its activities. In 1867-68, Engels was particularly occupied with its affairs since a new building was under construction. While Engels was away from Manchester in 1868, the Directorate invited Karl Vogt, who was connected with Bonapartist circles and had been casting aspersions on the proletarian revolutionaries, to give a lecture at the society. In view of this Engels decided that his political reputation would be compromised if he remained President (see this volume, p. 100 and present edition, Vol. 21, p. 18). On 2 October the secretary Davisson approached Engels on behalf of the Directorate asking him to reconsider his decision, but Engels refused. In April 1870 he was again elected member of the Directorate, but did not take an active part in its work.</span>

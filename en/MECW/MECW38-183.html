<p><b>[London,] 16 June 1851, 28 Dean Street, Soho</b></p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Daniels' house has been searched and he himself arrested. I don't think anything was found there.</p>
<p>This morning I received a letter, obviously in Daniels' handwriting but unsigned, informing me of the above and asking me to remove all letters since it had been learnt from a '<i>reliable</i>' (thus in the original) source that house searches would also be taking place here in England.</p>
<p>Whether that is legally possible I don't know. At any rate, I shall remove everything. You, too, would be well-advised to burn all — irrelevant — letters and to deposit the rest, those containing any data and the like, under seal with Mary [Burns] or your clerk.</p>
<p>It seems probable that an introduction from Daniels was found on Jacobi.</p>
<p>This morning at the same time I received, through a merchant, a letter from Weydemeyer, who is in hiding near Frankfurt. I enclose that letter. Do you happen to know the exact ratio, home to foreign, of Britain's trade, a figure which Weydemeyer wishes to know? The thing has changed significantly of late.</p>
<p><i>Salut!</i></p>
<p>Your<br>K. Marx
</p>

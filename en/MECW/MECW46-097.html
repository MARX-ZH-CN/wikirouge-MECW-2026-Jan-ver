ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY</p>
<p>IN ZURICH</p>
<p>London, 18 December 1881</p>
<p>Dear Mr Kautsky,</p>
<p>I got the telegram from you and Bernstein at 3.50 this afternoon and am glad to be able to inform you that Marx has now recovered<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>to the extent that he can be sent — initially—to the south coast of England. He will be going there in the course of this week; as soon as he has grown a little more accustomed to the open air and there is no further fear of a relapse, he will then probably move on to the south of Europe and spend some time there.</p>
<p>I couldn't reply to you by telegram, as it would have meant going to the CENTRAL OFFICE and, as usual, I had Pumps, her husband<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>and Sam Moore (all of whom send you their best wishes) here for a meal and later on, as you can imagine, more people dropped in. There would hardly be any point in telegraphing tomorrow as this letter will doubtless arrive just as soon (+).</p>
<p>About the Poles, something presently; things here have been rather at sixes and sevens of late.</p>
<p>So the <i>Egalité</i> is appearing again. Almost all the articles in No. 1 begin quite splendidly and end up most disappointingly. I haven't seen No. 2 yet.</p>
<p>Best wishes to Bernstein.</p>
<p>Yours</p>
<p>F. Engels

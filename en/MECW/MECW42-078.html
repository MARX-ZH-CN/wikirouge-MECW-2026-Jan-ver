MARX TO HERMANN JUNG</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 25 April 1865</p>
<p>Dear Jung,</p>
<p>I hope I may have the pleasure of your company at my house on Monday evening (ABOUT 8 O'CLOCK or LATER, if that hour is too early for you) for a MEETING with Ernest Jones and a small SUPPER. Apart from yourself, <i>only</i> Odger, Cremer and P. Fox. Had I wished to invite <i>more</i> guests, I should have had to ask <i>too many</i> for the purpose of the evening. This <i>entre nous!</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>I have just written to Cremer<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> that he should issue the letter of authority for P. Vinçard immediately, which Dupont must then deliver to Vinçard forthwith. It would be best if Dupont could despatch the thing to Vinçard <i>direct</i> without it having to go by way of Fribourg.</p>
<p>Vinçard had already written to Lubez that he would <i>not</i> accept if he did not receive the POWERS <i>direct</i> from London. In a letter to Fribourg Lubez promised to inform the 'CENTRAL COUNCIL' of this, but did not do so. I have reason to believe that Fribourg subsequently <b>forgot</b> the matter, not unintentionally.</p>
<p>I shall give you a verbal account of what further occurred in Paris (which was for the most part good); but in the meantime you should tell Dupont.</p>
<p><i>Salut et fraternité.</i></p>
<p>K. Marx

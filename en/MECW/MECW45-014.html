<p>Dear Kugelmann</p>
<p>I have at last decided to go to Karlsbad in the middle of August with my youngest daughter Eleanor (called Tussy). You must therefore see about lodgings and inform me how much it will cost per week. What happens later will depend on circumstances.</p>
<p>My best greetings to the Lady Countess and Fränzchen.</p>
<p>Yours</p>
<p><b>KM</b></p>
<p>The Austrian government would be stupid enough to put difficulties in my way; it is therefore advisable to let nobody know anything of the intended journey.

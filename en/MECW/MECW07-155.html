<blockquote>
<br>The meeting of the shareholders who financed the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> was held at the end of May 1848, and a provisional committee was elected consisting of Hermann Korff, Karl Wächter and Georg Weerth who apparently undertook the final editing of the Articles. The document was discussed at meetings of shareholders on June 18 and 21; in July, the Articles, printed as a separate pamphlet by Wilhelm Clouth, were sent to the shareholders.
<br>From the very beginning, differences arose between shareholders and editorial board. Many of the shareholders, displeased at the revolutionary trend of the newspaper, refused their contributions. They were particularly disturbed by the articles in defence of the proletarian uprising in Paris in June 1848. This led to the editor-in-chief, Marx, seeking other financial sources (the aid of the German and Polish democrats etc.) including his own personal means.

</blockquote><br>Article 1
<br>From today for a period of five years, a limited joint-stock company is formed for the purpose of publishing a daily newspaper under the title Neue Rheinische Zeitung. Organ der Demokratie.
<br>Article 2
<br>As a business the company carries the name H. Korff &amp; Co., and a change of the latter shall have no effect on the continued existence of the company.
<br>Article 3
<br>The premises of the newspaper office in Cologne at any given time shall be the address of the company.
<br>Article 4
<br>The capital of the company, which is fixed at 30,000 Prussian talers, will be raised by 600 shares of 50 talers each, and shareholders shall at once proceed to form the company.
<br>Article 5
<br>Payment of shares is made, if necessary, in instalments of between 5 and 10 per cent which are called on the order of the managers of the company announced by two insertions in the company's newspaper.
<br>Article 6
<br>If a shareholder does not pay a demanded instalment within the specified time, the company has the right either to declare forfeited the rights arising from the subscription, and from any payments already made, or to take him to court to force him to comply with contract.
<br>Article 7
<br>Interim receipts will be issued against payment of instalments, which on completion of payment are exchanged against shares..
<br>Article 8
<br>Interim receipts and shares are signed by the company managers.
<br>Article 9
<br>Shares bear serial numbers, are registered and, like the interim receipts, are transferable.
<br>Article 10
<br>The transfer of shares and interim receipts is performed by a declaration to that effect, signed by both the transferor and the transferee, and if fifty shares are already issued in the name of the transferee, only by permission of the managers, and in this case the company reserves the right to acquire the shares presented for transfer, for the purpose of amortisation.
<br>Article 11
<br>Every shareholder shares in the gains and losses of t h e company in proportion to the number of his shares, but is answerable for its liabilities only with the amount of his share.
<br>Article 12
<br>Every shareholder living elsewhere is obliged to choose an address in Cologne; failing that, the address of the company is regarded as such.
<br>Article 13
<br>The heirs or assigns of a shareholder can in no circumstances apply for affixation of seals, form an opposition, demand an inventory or licitation, even if t h e r e are among them minors or other disqualified persons; they must content themselves with the annual balance-sheet and the dividends as they are fixed for the other shareholders.
<br>Article 14
<br>The company is represented by a manager (Hermann Korff) and two co-managers (Louis Schulz and Stephan Adolph Naut), whose shares are called in for the period of their management.

<br>As emolument for their trouble the manager and co-managers receive a percentage of the income from subscriptions after deducting postage and stamp duty: 5 per cent of the first thousand subscriptions, 4 per cent of t h e next thousand, 3 per cent of t h e third thousand, 2 per cent of t h e fourth and thereafter 1 p e r cent of every thousand. T h e manager receives one-fifth of this amount, the two co-managers two-fifths each. In addition, the manager receives an annual salary of 800 talers.

<br>Article 19
<br>After one year has passed, the manager is allowed to leave the company, giving three months notice.

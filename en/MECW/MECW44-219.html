ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT</p>
<p>IN LEIPZIG</p>
<p>London, 23 April 1872</p>
<p>Dear Liebknecht,</p>
<p>We all send you our congratulations on your performance in court.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> After the trial of the Brunswickers<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> it was essential for someone to stand up to that gang and you have fairly done so. The only thing you might have left unsaid was the statement about the 1,000 members of the International.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Here in England jurymen are locked up overnight or kept <i>prisoner</i> under guard in an hotel, to make sure that they do not come into contact with anyone. They are taken for walks under escort and are also escorted to church on Sundays, if they wish to go. An exception is only made in cases like the Tichborne trial,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> where this was not possible because of the inordinate duration of the proceedings (105 days), but even then the jurymen are harassed in all sorts of ways.</p>
<p>Marx will reply to the <i>Concordia</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> as soon as he has compared <i>The Times</i> of 1864.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Your letter appeared in <i>The Eastern Post</i>;<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> whether it also appeared in <i>The Morning Post</i> is not to be discovered, since the paper is unobtainable here. The fact is that reading rooms where such things would be preserved, <i>have simply ceased to exist.</i> We send <i>The Eastern Post</i> regularly to the ends of the earth so that the letter will be publicised far more widely—and among the <i>right people</i>—than through other papers.</p>
<p>We can scarcely doubt that the sentence <i>must</i> be quashed. Such breaches of the law have been unheard of since the Demagogue trials.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> Nor can it be to the advantage of the national-liberal bourgeoisie to establish such precedents, and I doubt very much whether Bismarck, who is hiding behind the small states with the intention of discrediting them, would be willing to risk that sort of thing in Prussia.</p>
<p>I have seen very little about the trial in the English press—I have so many foreign papers to read that I can only read <i>The Daily News</i> and you must realise that since the introduction of the PENNY PRESS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> it is not possible to find papers <i>anywhere</i> to read without buying them. The article from <i>The Daily News</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> is enclosed; you can make good use of it.</p>
<p>I have passed the bill for the Rules<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> on to Marx; we shall send the money at the first opportunity.</p>
<p>I have not been able to get hold of a photograph of Blanqui up to now. The French have one but will not part with it, and there is none to be found here.</p>
<p>Enclosed the receipt for the 6 reichsthalers for the refugees. It is just not possible for us to conjure up an introduction to the <i>Manifesto</i> out of a hat for you.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> We shall have to study the socialist literature of the last 24 years, if we are to bring Section III up to date. This must be postponed for a subsequent edition, but we intend to send you a small preface<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> for the separate edition, and that will suffice for the moment.</p>
<p>What Scheu<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup> has to say about the Belgians is partly correct; the fellows have never been worth much and are now worth less than ever. We have sent someone over there who will let us have a detailed report shortly. At all events Scheu's deductions are wide of the mark—the mass of the people will never go so far with Messrs Hins (who through his Russian wife has a certain connection with Bakunin) and Steens (whose vanity is great enough to seduce him into foolish adventures). Particularly since we are making very good progress elsewhere in the world. Our people have defeated the Bakuninists at the Spanish Congress in Saragossa.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>As for Cuno, he has behaved extremely well in Milan and what he tells me in his letters about his fate is completely true and has been confirmed by the Italian press.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup> But it seems quite undeniable to me that, on his journeyings, having been shown the door for the sake of the International through no fault of his own and having landed in Bavaria, helpless and penniless, he has since been treated <i>very uncouthly</i> indeed by the people he has encountered in various places. He may have had rather dewy-eyed ideas about the help he might look forward to, but your money would be better spent if it were reserved for people <i>such as him,</i> instead of its being squandered on tramps and rogues <i>like Rüdt, etc.,</i> about whom you yourselves write letters like those read out at the trial (and which have unfortunately not appeared in the <i>Volksstaat</i>—as though that might help!). But, of course, Cuno was not one of the full-fledged men of the 'Party' and so had no business getting into trouble! If I had money I would really sooner send it to him than to anyone else.</p>
<p>The General Council's circular against the Bakuninists<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup> is now likely to appear next week; it is a French edition. The first instalment of Marx's second edition<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" id="cite_ref-18">[18]</a></sup> will also come out soon, but do not mention it until Marx writes to you about it or until it is out.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" id="cite_ref-19">[19]</a></sup> The Russian translation<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" id="cite_ref-20">[20]</a></sup> —a very good one—is out, the French version<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" id="cite_ref-21">[21]</a></sup> is in the press.</p>
<p>Enclosed are:</p>
<p>1. Receipt for the 6 thalers.
2. 3 cuttings from <i>The Eastern Post</i>—meetings of the General Council,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" id="cite_ref-22">[22]</a></sup> etc.
3. 1 <i>ditto</i> on the celebrations of 18 March.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23" id="cite_ref-23">[23]</a></sup> 4. 2 Irish documents.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24" id="cite_ref-24">[24]</a></sup> 5. Our reply to the debate in Parliament.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25" id="cite_ref-25">[25]</a></sup> 6. Article from <i>The Daily News</i> on your trial.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26" id="cite_ref-26">[26]</a></sup></p>
<p>So <i>nine items</i> in all.</p>
<p>Must catch the post. Best regards to Bebel and keep your chin up; they haven't got you in jug yet. But make sure that the sale of the stamps goes through properly and not just in Leipzig; we shall <i>be very strict</i> at the next Congress.</p>
<p>Best wishes to your family.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Following the arrest of Bebel, Liebknecht and Hepner (17 December 1870), Bismarck's government started preparations for a trial of the leaders of the Social-Democratic Workers' Party, who were charged with 'high treason' (see Note 134). The trial was held in Leipzig between 11 and 26 March 1872.<br>Though the charges brought against them had not been proved, Bebel and Liebknecht were condemned to two-year imprisonment in a fortress (with the deduction of the two months they had spent in prison before the trial); Hepner was acquitted. Following the trial in Leipzig, early in July 1872 Bebel was again brought before the court 'for insulting His Majesty', which he had allegedly done when addressing workers in Leipzig. Bebel was sentenced to additional 9 months in prison and deprived of his seat in the Reichstag.</span>

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The trial of Wilhelm Bracke, Bonhorst, Spier and other members of the Committee of the German Social-Democratic Workers' Party took place in the Brunswick district court in November 1871. (On their arrest see Note 115.) The main point of the indictment was their membership of the International. The court found Bracke and Bonhorst guilty of 'infringing public order' and sentenced them to 16 months in prison. In February 1872, however, the court of appeal quashed the sentence as groundless and cut the term of imprisonment from 16 to 3 months, also deducting the period of preliminary detention; this virtually amounted to an acquittal.</span>

Following the publication of Marx's reply in <i>Der Volksstaat, Concordia,</i> No. 27, 4 July 1872, featured another anonymous article (also written by Brentano), 'Wie Karl Marx sich vertheidigt'.

</li>
<li id="cite_note-20"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-20">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The Russian edition of Volume I of <i>Capital</i> was published at the end of March 1872; the edition of 3,000 copies was rather large for that time. It was sold very quickly, contrary to the Tsarist censors' expectations; they considered <i>Capital</i> to be a work 'difficult to understand', and that was the reason they allowed its publication (see also Note 146).</span>
</li>
<li id="cite_note-21"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-21">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The surviving manuscript copy of the letter does not bear the name of the addressee. However, its contents and Marx's correspondence on the subject indicate that it was addressed to the heads of the Lachâtre publishing house in Paris. On 13 February 1872 Marx received a reply from the manager Juste Vernouillet, who informed him about the despatch of copies of the agreement on the publication of the French translation of Volume I of <i>Capital.</i> The agreement was signed on 15 February by Marx on one side, and Maurice Lachâtre and Juste Vernouillet on the other. It stipulated that the French edition was to be published in 44 instalments, and sold five instalments at a time.<br>The French authorised edition of Volume I of <i>Capital</i> was published between 17 September 1872 and November 1875. The translation was done by Joseph Roy, who began in February 1872 and completed work in late 1873. The quality of the translation largely failed to satisfy Marx; besides, he was convinced that the original needed to be revised to adapt it to French readers.</span>

Still, the public meeting, for which 5,000 French and British democrats had gathered, did not take place, since at the last moment the owner of the hall where it was to be held refused admission. The meeting then elected 150 delegates who made their way to Frances Street, where the <i>Cercle d'Études Sociales</i> was housed (see Note 613), and marked 18 March, the first anniversary of the Paris Commune, with a ceremony. At the suggestion of Commune members Albert Theisz and Zéphirin Camélinat and General Council member George Milner, the delegates adopted three short resolutions written by Marx (see present edition, Vol. 23, p. 128).</span>

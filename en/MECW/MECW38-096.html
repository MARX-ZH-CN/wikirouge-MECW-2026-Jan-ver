<br>Dear Engels,
<br>I am being banished to the Morbihan <em>département</em>, the Pontine marshes of Brittany<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> . I need hardly say that I shall not consent to this veiled attempt on my life. So I am leaving France.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>They won't give me a passport for Switzerland, hence I must go to London, and that tomorrow. In any case, Switzerland will soon be hermetically sealed and the mice would be trapped all at one go.
<br>Besides, in London there is a <em>positive</em> prospect of my being able to start a German newspaper. [Neue Rheinische Zeitung. Politisch-ökonomische Revue] I am <em>assured</em> of part of the funds.
<br>So you must leave for London at once. In any case your safety demands it. The Prussians would shoot you twice over: 1) because of Baden, 2) because of Elberfeld.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> And why stay in a Switzerland where you can do nothing?
<br>You will have no difficulty in coming to London, whether under the name of Engels or under the name of Mayer. As soon as you say you want to go to England, you will receive a one-way passport to London from the French Embassy.
<br>I count on this <em>absolutely</em>. You <em>cannot</em> stay in Switzerland. In London we shall get down to business.
<br>For the time being my wife will remain here. Continue to write to her at the same address: 45, rue de Lille, M. Ramboz.
<br>But once again, I confidently count on you not to leave me in the lurch.
<br>Your<br>K. M.
<br>Lupus [Wilhelm Wolff] is at Dr Lüning's, Zurich. Write and tell him also about my plan.

(*) On <i>13 June</i> 1849 the Montagne (bloc of democrats and petty-bourgeois socialists grouped around the newspaper <i>La Réforme</i>) staged a peaceful demonstration to protest against the sending of French troops to suppress the Roman Republic. The demonstration was dispersed by the army and the bourgeois detachments of the National Guards and there followed a counter-revolutionary offensive, persecution of democrats and proletarian activists, including emigrants. Many Montagnards were arrested or emigrated.</br></br></br></span>

Jenny Marx got permission to stay in Paris till 15 September with her children, but Marx was obliged to make leave in haste.

Engels arrived in Elberfeld on 11 May and took an active part in the uprising, in particular directing the erection of street barricades. However, his efforts to secure the disarmament of the bourgeois civic militia, the imposition of a war tax on the bourgeoisie, the formation of the nucleus of a Rhenish revolutionary army out of armed workers' detachments and to unite localised uprisings, met with opposition from the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois leaders of the movement. Under pressure from bourgeois circles Engels was expelled front the town on 15 May. The uprising in Elberfeld, as in other towns of the Rhine Province, was a failure.<br><br>On Engels' participation in the revolutionary struggle in Baden and the Palatinate see notes 264 and 265.</br></br></span>

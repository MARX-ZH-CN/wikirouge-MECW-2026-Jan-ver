<p><i>To Joseph Weydemeyer in Frankfurt Am Main</i>

<h4 class="mw-headline" id="ME38-94-2">Paris, mid-August 1849</h4><a id="Paris,_mid-August_1849"></a>
<p>Weydemeyer,</p>
<p>I will gladly fall in with Rühl's suggestion<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> if he agrees to take over the whole of the business side, at which I am no good and for which he will he paid a commission.</p>
<p>1) But I have no publisher on hand to make the necessary advances,</p>
<p>2) the subscription lists seem to me superfluous. Announcements in the <i>Westdeutsche</i> and other papers in the Rhineland and elsewhere would achieve the same purpose. The thing should be advertised particularly in the Berlin, Hamburg, Leipzig and Breslau papers.</p>
<p>The news about your paper [Neue Deutsche Zeitung] is very bad. I shall at once write and inform Naut, the trusty old business manager of the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i>, and acquaint you with the result.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>You would already have had my article but for the fact that the illness of my wife and all the children has meant that I have been a kind of male nurse for the past week.</p>
<p>Best regards to your wife.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.</p>
<p>I hope for a reply as soon as possible.

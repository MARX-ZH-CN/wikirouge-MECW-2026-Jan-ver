MARX TO PETER IMANDT</p>
<p>IN DUNDEE</p>
<p><i>London,</i> 27 September 1875 <i>41 Maitland Park Road, N. W.</i></p>
<p>Dear Imandt,</p>
<p>I was very glad to hear from you again at last. I have only just arrived back from taking the cure at Karlsbad.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> It has done me a great deal of good and is also the reason why I didn't know about the article that was sent to me.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I imagine it originates from Barry, a very fanatical Scottish party member. The article in <i>Fraser's</i> (to which Eccarius, Hales, Mottershead, Jung contributed their share—chaps now in very low water) stems from a deplorable novelist, Mrs Betham- Edwards<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> who relates, e.g., that my anti-Proudhon piece<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> is a short chapter in <i>Capital.</i></p>
<p>Printing of the French edition of the latter (the last three FASCICLES in particular heavily revised by me) has been constantly <i>disrupted by the French government.</i> The last three instalments, which were set more than six months ago, are finally to be allowed to leave the press. I shall send them to you on receipt of the same.</p>
<p>Kaub and Dr C. Hirsch, who have come over from Paris for a few days, tell me that things are going ill with our old friend Schily (he is still living at 4 rue St Quentin); to begin with, there had been trouble for years between him and his better half, health ruined, lost most of his German clients through their having to leave Paris after the catastrophe,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> has grown morose, francophobe and somewhat conservative. He could probably do well for himself in Strasbourg, but is rightly too proud to petition the Prussians.</p>
<p>In Germany I found much disenchantment, even among the philistines, following the sorry outcome of the milliards windfall.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The whole family send their warmest regards. Drop us a line again soon.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

On his way there, he stopped over in Frankfurt am Main (see Note 109). On his way back to London, he spent several days in Prague visiting Max Oppenheim.</span>

The period of feverish business activity, which witnessed the mushrooming of railway, industrial, construction and commercial joint-stock companies, banks and credit and social security companies and was accompanied by large-scale speculation, stock-exchange swindles and machinations, has come to be known as<i> Gründerjahre</i> (or the period of<i> Criindertum).</i> By 1873 it had resulted in a crash followed by an economic crisis, which lasted well into 1877.</span>

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Engels sent the present note to Eleanor Marx-Aveling, together with Bonnier's letter to Engels of 14 January 1890. Engels sent this letter to Eleanor Aveling at Bonnier's request. It was a continuation of Bonnier's talk with Engels about the French Workers' Party preparing to start a newspaper of its own (see also note 33). This plan only materialised in September 1890, as the party resumed the publication of its weekly newspaper Le Socialiste, which became its central organ. In his letter Bonnier asked Eleanor Marx-Aveling for her comments on the Gas Workers' strike (see note 577) for the French newspaper Le Cri du travailleur.</span>

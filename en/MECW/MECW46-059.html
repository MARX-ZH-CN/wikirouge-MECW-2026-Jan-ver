ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE</p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>London, 2 June 1881</p>
<p>My dear Sorge,</p>
<p>In the person of the bearer I introduce to you our friend Leo Hart- mann, of Moscow celebrity. To recommend him specially to your at- tention could be superfluous. If during his stay in America you can in any way be of service to him you will by that render a service to the common cause and a personal favor to Marx and myself.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Fr. Engels

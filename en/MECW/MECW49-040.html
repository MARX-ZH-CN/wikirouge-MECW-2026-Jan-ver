ENGELS TO VICTOR ADLER</p>
<p>IN VIENNA</p>
<p>London, 17 November 1890</p>
<p>Dear Adler,</p>
<p>You will have had my letter written on Saturday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>Meanwhile the Avelings have had a telegram from Louise (last night at about 11 o'clock): 'THUSDAY MORNING VICTORIA.' Well, this might mean THURSDAY, but also TUESDAY. That is the least of our problems however. We know nothing whatever about the latest routes for through express trains from Vienna, but only that it's possible to come via Calais, Ostend or Flushing. On the journey via Calais or Ostend the trains arrive at about 5 a. m., and via Flushing at about 8 a. m. I therefore tele- graphed you (being uncertain whether or not Louise had already left) shortly before four o'clock: 'Is Louise travelling via Flushing, Os- tend or Calais, reply paid (12 words).' This is to explain what has happened, which might otherwise strike you as puzzling and odd.</p>
<p>Since Louise has now definitely announced her arrival here, no purpose would be served by sending another ten pounds per money order and this has consequently not been done.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. Engels

<br><i>To Marx in London</i>
<br><br>
<b>Manchester, April 16, 1869</b>
<br>Dear Moor,
<br>Enclosed returned the 2 Ludlows<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and the 2 'knavish tricks'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> From Wilhelm you sent only the few lines for me, not those to you to which you refer.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> If Wilhelm can't d o more than this, t h en it is a miracle he did not d o even worse in Barmen.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> In a few days I shall send you reports in <i>Zukunft</i> about the general assembly<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> which appeared very late and show that the ground had already been well prepared in Schweitzer's association, and that the rebellion would have broken out even without Wilhelm.
<br>The Ludlow correspondence very useful.
<br>Many thanks for the Rameau<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> which will give me much pleasure. At the moment I am reading almost nothing, in order finally to get my eye back on the right track; I have also cut down on my work at the office.
<br>Wilhelm is badly mistaken if he thinks I would send him the Peasant War<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> on the basis of such vague promises, so he could subsequently pop up and yell that, if I did not send the sum of umpteen pounds, it would be impossible to print the final sheets. His letter is real twaddle, and his calm assumption that you should pay his fees is impudent.
<br>Fowler, the STIPENDIARY MAGISTRATE here, who had the Fenians brought into court shackled to one another, has relinquished his post. Leaving behind his wife and 2 children, he has eloped with the wife of Milne, the CHAIRMAN OF QUARTER SESSIONS (daughter of the late Brooks, the rich BANKER, and WORTH £80,000 IN HER OWN RIGHT), who, for her part, left 5 children with her beloved husband. Great consternation amongst the philistines.
<br><i>Salut</i>.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.
<br>This final story can only be explained etymologically; Fowler from Fowl ≈ Vogel.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>

<li id="cite_note-4"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-4">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">A reference to the dispute between Liebknecht, Bebel and Schweitzer at the congress of the General Association of German Workers held in Barmen-Elberfeld on 28-31 March 1869. Bebel and Liebknecht accused Schweitzer of having contacts with the Bismarck Government and of attempts to prevent the formation of a united workers' party in Germany. The congress showed that Schweitzer's authority had been undermined: 14 delegates representing 4,635 of the Association's members refused to give him a vote of confidence, while 42 delegates with 7,400 votes gave such a vote. The congress adopted a number of resolutions aimed at restricting Schweitzer's dictatorial powers and making the internal life of the Association more democratic: in addition to the President, it was to be headed by a board of twelve members and its seat was to be in Hamburg. A proposal was moved to convene a Social-Democratic congress in Germany with a view to 'founding a united organisation'. On Schweitzer's suggestion, it was resolved to establish closer contacts with the International to the extent permitted by the German law. In fact, however, the Association's leadership continued to pursue a sectarian policy and obstruct the affiliation of the Association with the International.</span>

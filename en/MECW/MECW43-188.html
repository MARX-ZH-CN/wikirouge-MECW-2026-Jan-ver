MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London, 16 April 1869]</p>
<p>E. = Eichhoff—B.=Borkheim.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I had written to Wilhelm<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> saying he should cease his malicious chatter and scribbling directed against Eichhoff, since Borkheim himself has now recognised his error. Wilhelm, of course, does not know that I know <i>his own</i> insinuations against Eichhoff from Kugelmann and OLD Becker.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Did you receive the Lafargue manuscript?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> It is not noted in today's letter from you.</p>
<p>Apropos: <i>Hermann</i> is now Stieber's official organ. Juch was forced to sell it, because of his 'diverse' creditors. In today's issue, Stieber starts right away by printing, on the first page, warrant notices, e.g., against the so-and-so Jaeger for illicit abortion of the foetus. Stieber is naturally represented here by a National-Liberal 'sub-Stieber'. I shall hunt out the carefully 'hushed-up' name.'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>With regard to the eye: try washing it with alcohol. This helped me. To begin with it hurts a bit. For the FIRST attempt, dilute the alcohol a bit with water. That will show you how much you can stand it. Anyway, trying can't hurt.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>

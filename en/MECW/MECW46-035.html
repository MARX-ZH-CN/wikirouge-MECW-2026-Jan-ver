ENGELS TO JOHANN PHILIPP BECKER</p>
<p>IN GENEVA</p>
<p>London, 24 December 1880</p>
<p>Dear Old Man,</p>
<p>This is to advise you in all haste that I have taken out a money order for you for five pounds sterling = 126 frs, which I trust you will receive.</p>
<p>When Liebknecht was here 6 ° I hauled him over the coals for hav- ing failed so much as to consider you when distributing the relief fund. I told him you were just as much, if not more, a victim of the Anti-Socialist Law ' 6 as many of the Berliners, amongst whom there are some notorious blackguards. Now he has written to say: <i>Becker will be cared for.</i> So make sure this is done and, if not and supposing it embarrasses you to dun them, drop me a line and I'll see to it for you.</p>
<p>Better luck in the New Year.</p>
<p>Your old friend,</p>
<p>F. Engels

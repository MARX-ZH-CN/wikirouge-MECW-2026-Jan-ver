ENGELS TO HERMANN SCHLÜTER
<br>IN HOTTINGEN-ZURICH
<br>London, 13 January 1885
<br>Dear Mr Schlüter,
<br>By all means start with the <i>Anti-Dühring</i> as soon as convenient.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>I have not read the philistine's reply,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> nor do I wish to do so. Reply he cannot and he's welcome to lay about him with as much insolent verbiage as he wishes.
<br>I have long been searching in vain for the <i>Rheinische Zeitung Revue.</i> I only have numbers <i>3, 5</i> and <i>6;</i> 1, 2 and 4 are missing. There are virtually no articles in them worth reprinting. Numbers 1-4 contain Marx's history of the French Revolution from 1848 to 1850<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> (comprised in the <i>18th Brumaire)</i> and my account of events in May 1849 in the Rhineland and Baden-Palatinate.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> Then the <i>Peasant War</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> (5 and 6) and short critical essays, as also a review of daily events.
<br>The right to work is not touched on other than very briefly in, I think, Number I; Marx wasn't much interested in catchphrases.
<br>It would be quite a good idea for you to inquire from Wigand in your own name about a new edition of the <i>Condition etc.,</i> but that won't get us very much further. I have got to know how I stand with him in law and shall inquire again from Freytag. N. B. I am assuming that, as soon as the matter is sufficiently advanced, you will come to an understanding with Dietz, as he does in fact have, or might assert, a prior claim.
<br>Regards to Ede.
<br>Yours faithfully,
<br>F. Engels

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">On 7 April 1884 Eduard Bernstein informed Engels that the second and third parts of his work <i>Anti-Dühring</i> ('Political Economy' and 'Socialism', see present edition, Vol. 25) were almost sold out and that 300 copies remained of the first part ('Philosophy'). He therefore suggested that a new edition of the work be prepared, but this time as a single volume and not in separate parts. The second German edition of <i>Anti-Dühring</i> appeared in Zurich at the beginning of December 1885 with additions made by Engels to the second chapter of the third part. The title page gave the year of publication as 1886.</span>

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE</p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>London, 5 November 1892</p>
<p>Dear Sorge,</p>
<p>You must forgive my laziness about writing; I have got to finish Volume II<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>this winter; it <i>must</i> be completed and this won't be possible unless I set <i>all my</i> correspondence aside. I have been at it for 3 weeks and can only tell you that the work is going more smoothly than I could have hoped; the last time I had to break off, I had made good headway and now it's paying dividends. But there still remains a mass of work to do, though I am far enough advanced to be able to see the end of it. And nobody is more glad of that than I; this piece of work has been a burden on my conscience. I have forced myself to make time for it since it couldn't be done in less than 4 months of complete freedom from all other jobs; I know that, unless I do it now, it will never be done, for we are entering a period of rebellion and war. But like everyone else you will have to suffer for it pro tem—so please forgive me!</p>
<p>Your F.E.

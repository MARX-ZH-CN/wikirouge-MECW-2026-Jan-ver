<p><i>To Engels in London</i>

<p><b>Dear Fred</b>,</p>
<p>Letter and enclosure received with many thanks.</p>
<p>The Longuet family will be 'making' for London, as Lessner puts it, on Saturday (next). So far all has gone well with Jennychen, although she still has a bit of asthma, but she proposes — Obstinately, a la Lupus — to combine feeding her child with teaching.</p>
<p>Yesterday, to my intense surprise, <i>Meyer</i> suddenly materialised in front of me on the <b>sands</b>. To my relief, he immediately explained that he had taken lodgings for the day in <i>Margate</i> whither he would be returning in a few hours' time, and that all he wanted was to inquire about 'madame's' health, etc. I did the honours of the place for a while and then handed him over to Longuet so that he might speed him on his way. He — Meyer — is going to Edinburgh for the <b>Trades Union Congress</b>. I'm glad this 'crisis' was so short-lived. The good fellow's tendency towards Ramsgate has been <b>irrepressible</b>. He told Longuet, by the by, that his liver had got much worse so that he could no longer 'take' the accustomed amount of 'spirits' without their going to his head. An attempt, no doubt, to gloss over his recent <b>accidents</b> at Maitland Park, etc.</p>
<p>The weather here is partly good and partly bad, the latter having a tendency to predominate.</p>

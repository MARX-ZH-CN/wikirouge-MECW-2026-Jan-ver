ENGELS TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN
<br>IN HANOVER
<br>London, 4 May 1884
<br>122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.
<br>Dear Kugelmann,
<br>My health is ALL RIGHT; it was a tedious and inconvenient affair though in no way serious, but to describe it to you would take pages. I received your card and also send my thanks for the Leibnitziad; unfortunately I cannot embark on incidental studies of this kind, as I have my hands full attending to Volume II<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and revising translations of Marx's things into German,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> English and French.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> On top of that there are new editions of two of my works.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> The 2nd book will probably appear separately, but, having lost so much time during the autumn and winter, I am very behindhand with everything and, as I am being solicited from so many quarters, I have resolved to make no more promises.
<br>Your
<br>F. Engels

The translation into German was begun by Eduard Bernstein who was later joined by Karl Kautsky. Engels edited the translation, wrote a special preface for it and a number of notes, using the amendments made by Marx on a copy of the French edition of 1847. The book was published by Dietz in Stuttgart in January 1885.</span>

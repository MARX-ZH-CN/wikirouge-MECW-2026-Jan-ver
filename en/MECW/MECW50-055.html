ENGELS TO FILIPPO TURATI
<br>IN MILAN
<br>[London, 1 February 1893]
<br>Dear citizen Turati,
<br>Here is the preface.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> You are going too quickly for me in Italy. Your Panamino, which threatens to become a Panamone, is undergoing evolutions and vicissitudes at such a rate that we here in London cannot keep up with events in Rome. Therefore I have refrained from speaking about them, for fear of being outdated the very next day. This should explain why what I have written is not particularly topical.
<br>But where on earth were the socialist, deputies during these decisive days? Ours in Germany would never be forgiven if they had not been present at the Colajanni meeting—it would have cost them their mandates!
<br>Yours,
<br>F.E.

ENGELS TO HERMANN ARNOLDT</p>
<p>IN KÖNIGSBERG</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London,] 21 October 1878</p>
<p>In reply to your esteemed letter of the 18th, I shall gladly take temporary charge of the documents concerned.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>Having no fire-proof safe, however, I cannot, of course, accept responsibility in the matter of fire or theft, and should be obliged if you would <i>expressly</i> acknowledge this fact in your <i>accompanying letter.</i> Other aspects can be dealt with in our subsequent correspondence. I shall preserve the papers concerned as carefully as those of a similar nature belonging to myself.

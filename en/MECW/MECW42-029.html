MARX TO HERMANN JUNG<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>IN LONDON
<br>Manchester,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> [about 8 January 1865] 58 Dover Street, Oxford Street
<br>My dear Jung,
<br>I felt rather shocked at reading in the 'Beehive' and the 'Miner' of this week that at our last Committee-sitting
<br>'It was <i>unanimously</i> agreed to invite Messrs Beesly, <i>Grossmith,</i> Beales and Harrison, to the soirée which is to be held on the 16th'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <br>I do not mention the mere anachronism, that no such resolution was taken on <i>last Tuesday's</i> sitting.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> <br>What I object to is the positive falsehood that <i>Mr Grossmith</i> was invited.
<br>This <i>Grossmith,</i> although he seldom or never attends our sittings, figures as a member of the Committee under all our addresses.
<br>How could <i>our</i> Committee invite a <i>member of our Committee</i> to a soirée <i>given by our Committee?</i> Shall this, perhaps, form a sort of <i>premium</i> to be gained by regular absence from our weekly séances?
<br>Since I cannot return to London before the end of next week, you'll much oblige me
<br>By asking at next Tuesday's sitting, who is the <i>writer</i> of the report in the 'Beehive' and the 'Miner?
<br>Who empowered that writer to make our Committee the <b>unconscious</b> instrument of exalting <i>Mr Grossmith?</i>
<br>You will understand at once how important it is to nip in the bud any attempt at turning our Committee into the tool of local ambitions, or any sort of intrigues.
<br><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> <br>You will oblige me, by informing me, under the above address,—and supposing you to make the interpellation—what answer was given to you.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> <br><i>Salut et fraternité.</i>
<br>K. Marx

This decision was recorded in the Minutes of that meeting. The report of the meeting was not published, and Cremer, when sending the report of the next meeting, of 3 January 1865, to the newspapers, included the above-mentioned decision in it and recorded it for a second time in the Minute Book. Moreover, on his own initiative, Cremer inserted in the decision Grossmith's name who, as a Central Council member, did not have to be specially invited. As is evident from Jung's reply letter to Marx of 11 January, Marx's protest against the inclusion of Grossmith's name was read out at the Central Council meeting of 10 January; Cremer admitted his mistake, and Grossmith's name was deleted from the Minutes of the meeting of 3 January.</span>

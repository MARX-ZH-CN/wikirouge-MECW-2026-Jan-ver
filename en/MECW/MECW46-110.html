MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Ventnor,] 15 January 1882</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>BEST THANKS FOR THE £ 20. I have resolved to leave tomorrow as the weather is getting progressively 'colder', which does my swollen cheek no good. So I shall lose only 2 days, and this will also save Tussy the double journey.</p>
<p>Though repeatedly warned, our people in Paris have got themselves into a nice mess<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>(SERVES Lafargue AND Guesde RIGHT); however, since they possess two papers,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>they may, with a little ingenuity, nevertheless gain command of the field.</p>
<p>I regard it as a major victory, not only in Germany itself but vis-à-vis the outside world GENERALLY, that Bismarck should <i>admit</i> in the Reichstag that the German workers have to some extent 'given the thumbs down' to his state socialism. London's rascally bourgeois press always sought to disseminate the opposite.</p>
<p>I have received an extraordinarily kind letter from OLD Frankel from the 'state prison', ditto a letter from Wrôblewski who was <i>évidemment</i> writing on behalf of his Polish party in Geneva; but in his haste he forgot to append not only the party's name but also his own.</p>
<p>If, as Joffrin relates in his factum in the <i>Prolétaire</i> he once staged <i>a pro-Guesde demonstration</i> in London against the 'International' there, it was at all events such a <i>platonic</i> demonstration that no one knew anything about it apart from Joffrin himself and perhaps a few of his closest accomplices, i. e. it was carried out entirely in 'private'.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Moor

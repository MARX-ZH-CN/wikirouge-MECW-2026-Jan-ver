MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 19 May 1862</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>A week ago last Thursday, you wrote saying you intended to send some wine for little Jenny and Co.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I showed the children your letter. The wine failed to arrive so they were disappointed. I attach importance to it just now because it's a distraction for them, and the house is otherwise very forlorn.</p>
<p>Nothing could be worse than the kind of oppressiveness which now broods over the whole place.</p>
<p>Luckily, I have neither heard nor seen anything of the EXHIBITION<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> or its visitors, and hope that this 'immunity' will continue, since I am now in no position to entertain PEOPLE.</p>
<p>As soon as you have a moment to spare, let me know briefly what you think of the military operations in the UNITED STATES, particularly McClellan's deeds of derring-do.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

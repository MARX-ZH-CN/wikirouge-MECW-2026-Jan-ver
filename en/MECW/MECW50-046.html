ENGELS TO MARIA MENDELSON</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 16 January 1893</p>
<p>Dear Mme Mendelson,</p>
<p>The article in <i>Vorwärts</i> of which you speak was written in Paris.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> It seems that the author was told that the 5 arrested Poles belonged to the same socialist school as, among the Russians, Plekhanov and his friends; and the correspondent has thus committed the <i>quid pro quo</i> that we have all sadly read.</p>
<p>The article which I sent to <i>Vorwärts</i> is in the following issue (No. II, 13th January).</p>
<p>Let us congratulate ourselves nonetheless that this latest base action by the French government has only led to an expulsion.</p>
<p>Mme Kautsky joins her greetings to those of your devoted</p>
<p>F. Engels

ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>Manchester, 3 December 1860
<br>Dear Moor,
<br>As a result of God alone knows what combination of circumstances, I've had to draw out such a frightfully large sum of money in the past 4 weeks that I absolutely <i>must</i> wait a day or two now. If possible, I shall get a pound off to you tomorrow, and more as soon as I can, in the course of the next few days. For a while, at least, I am reduced to drawing only small amounts at a time; the point is that where Ermen is concerned, it behoves me just now TO APPEAR TO LIVE WITHIN MY INCOME (which I did <i>not</i> do during the last financial year); in view of the negotiations, this is an expedient that I simply cannot allow myself to be deprived of. If I could think up some pretext, I would try to borrow £5 for a fortnight from Gumpert, but I couldn't do so without his guessing what the reason was, and anyway I don't know whether he would have it at this season. I know very well what a fix you are in and shall do all I can — but the £10 I sent you recently has already been debited in advance to December's account, which means that that month is already heavily mortgaged. All the same, you'll get something tomorrow for sure.
<br>I was ready to do an article<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> for you this evening (last Friday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> my eye was so inflamed that writing by gas-light was out of the question), but Szemere—who sends you his regards—has just turned up, and so it's OUT OF THE QUESTION today as well. I shall do all I can tomorrow evening.
<br>Books<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> received. The thing's splendid. Especially the 'Studies' and 'Agency'; <i>cela est écrasant!</i> More about the rest shortly. Most of the copies have already been distributed.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

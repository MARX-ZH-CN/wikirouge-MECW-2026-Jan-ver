MARX TO NIKOLAI DANIELSON</p>
<p>IN ST PETERSBURG</p>
<p>London, 22 March 1873</p>
<p>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>You would much oblige me in giving me <i>some information</i> on the views of Tschitscherin, relating to the historical development of communal property in Russia; and on his polemics on that subject with Bjeljajew.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> The way in which that form of property was founded (historically) in Russia, is of course a secondary question, and has nothing whatever to do with the value of that institution. Still, the German reactionists like Professor A. Wagner in Berlin, etc., use that weapon put in their hands by Tschitscherin.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> At the same time all historical analogy speaks against Tschitscherin. How should it have come to happen that in Russia the same institution had been simply introduced as a fiscal measure, as a concomitant incident of serfdom, while everywhere else it was of spontaneous growth and marked a necessary phase of development of free peoples?</p>
<p>Yours most truly,</p>
<p>A. Williams<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> </p>

Belyaev argued against Chicherin's idea that communal landownership, which still existed in Russia in the 19th century, had its roots in the taxation system of the Russian serf-owning state and was not a remnant of the ancient form of communal peasant property.</span>

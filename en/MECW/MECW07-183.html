<p>Cologne, October 13. A very well-informed friend in Brussels writes to us:</p>
<p>"Engels and Dronke were arrested and transported across the frontier in a prison van only because they were imprudent enough to give their names.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>A worker from Cologne, Schmitz, who is supposed to have played an active part in the freeing of Wächter, shared the same fate. The fact is that the Brussels police had a long list of persons who have fled from Cologne. Thus the Belgian police were accurately informed also about the alleged participation of Schmitz in the freeing of Wächter."</p>

Is perhaps acting Police Superintendent Geiger informed about the authors and senders of this black list?</p><div class="mw-references-wrap"><ol class="references">

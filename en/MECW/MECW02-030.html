<blockquote>
<p>This poem was written on the occasion of the transfer, in 1840, of Napoleon 118 remains from St. Helena to Paris.

<p>Paris is empty. All the populace<br>Swarms out to throng the Seine on either side.<br>Bright shines the sun of France, though veiled in mourning.<br>A tear bedews the smiling face of pride.</p>
<p>Today the ebullient French are grave and calm.<br>They dream of victory's laurel wreath no more.<br>Ringed with eternal laurels comes the scourge<br>Of Europe, God of France, the Emperor.</p>
<p>like grey old battle ruins, the veteran soldiers<br>Ride on before and after. The funeral train<br>With cannon thundering and banners flying<br>Moves on towards Paris. Rich, exuberant, vain,</p>
<p>Plunged into grief, devotion-drunk once more,<br>Paris falls prostrate at her idol's feet;<br>And if the price be still more suffering —<br>They shall not flinch. Thoughts of revenge are sweet.</p>
<p>Music of death and music of the wars<br>Crashes all round. The gentlest heart is thrilled.<br>Thus rode he in the blaze of victory<br>From Austerlitz and from Marengo's field.</p>
<p>And pale, and mute, and proud, and great, as when<br>He rode in triumph through the swirling throng,<br>Transformed as never by the light of glory,<br>Acclaimed by all, the Emperor rides along.</p>
<p>Where are they now, the Guards? Where is Dombrowski,<br>General of the Slays and no man's slave?<br>Murat, the prince of horsemen? Poniatowski?<br>And where is Ney, the Bravest of the Brave?</p>
<p>Thinned is the forest of the mighty heroes.<br>Waterloo's fury mowed the Guardsmen down.<br>The remnants march in silence, heads held high.<br>Behind iron bars weeps Montholon, alone.</p>
<p>The strength and flower of Empire follow after.<br>United here the young and old of France.<br>And even the elite of the Republic<br>Weep at the shrine where weeps the whole of France.</p>
<p>And who are these with brows of victory<br>That yet betray the anguish of their souls,<br>Their features ravaged by the grief of mourning,<br>Though they step proudly? Hush, it is the Poles.</p>
<p>To greet the Emperor — arches, columns, stones,<br>Memorials, images of eternity,<br>Ideas in bronze as daring as his own,<br>To sanctify his fallen majesty.</p>
<p>Collapsed his house, tumbled the royal crown,<br>Gone is the world empire that he dreamed might be.<br>Like Alexander, without heirs he sleeps<br>The eternal sleep beneath the laurel-tree.</p>
<p>He rests in peace, Silent the <i>Te Deum</i>.<br>In pious gloom the shadowed columns rear.<br>This very church is now his mausoleum.<br>A deity lies dead and buried here.</p>
<p><br>
Friedrich O.

MARX TO ENGELS
<br>IN MANCHESTER
<br>[London,] 17 September 1853 28 Dean Street, Soho
<br>DEAR Frederic,
<br>You're becoming damned taciturn. Since I was expecting YOUR ARTICLE yesterday, all I had done was to make up a heading from the most recent news and, since the letter didn't come, one lot of correspondence went by the board.
<br>I really must ask for your co-operation for the fortnight beginning today. For today <i>Pieper</i> is going, not into a monastery exactly, but into the German Hospital, a sort of medical prison, where he is to spend a fortnight or 3 weeks being thoroughly cured of the painful consequences of his carnal lust. Since I have in any case forfeited 3 or 4 articles through having to traipse off to that rotten Spielmann,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I must now write something every Tuesday and Friday so that the next bill I draw is not too paltry. There is a possibility of Freiligrath's finding a business friend who will regularly discount them for me.
<br>If you can manage to do something in between times, I shall send you the other stuff to look through, in which case you will only have to preface or conclude it with the latest news you may have seen about TURKEY in the <i>Débats</i>, say, or some particularly important telegraphic dispatch, before sending the stuff to Liverpool.
<br>I expect an article<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> from you for Tuesday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <br>I think it important that something be said about the position of the armies, etc. There's a great deal of nonsense in the English papers, e.g. Omer Pasha is said to be crossing the Danube, etc.
<br>I have already sent off two articles about the commercial crisis, 1 last Friday week about the Bank of England, its DISCOUNT and the effect of Peel's Act, or rather intended effect.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> 1 last Tuesday on the price of corn, signs OF OVERPRODUCTION, etc.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> <br>I think it important to have more details about the MANUFACTURING DISTRICTS.
<br>Enclosed something further by the <i>Tribune</i> man<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> and on him by the EDITORS of the <i>Tribune</i>. It would seem, by the by, that he is not a Russian AFTER ALL, but A GERMAN. The abolition of the advertisement duty means that Jones' advertisements now bring him in £3 a week—the PAPER<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> IS ARRIVING TO THE PAYING POINT. This could also provide Pieper with a source of income.
<br>When you write, you must also tell me about Lupus' travels. I heard later that he didn't push off from here until last Saturday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> <br>FAREWELL.
<br>Your
<br>K. M.
<br>Enclosed another cutting from the worthy <i>Neu-England-Zeitung</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>

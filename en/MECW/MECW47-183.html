ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>London, 4 July 1885</p>
<p>My dear Laura,</p>
<p>Herewith the cheque £ 15.- as desired by Paul who I hope does not suffer too much from the heat which ought to be rather trying in Ste Pélagie<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>by this time.</p>
<p>Your adventure with the Russians vividly recalled to me the times when one was never sure that Dupont would not drop in about half past one in the morning with one or two <i>citoyens</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>(something in a lightly elevated state) whom he then and there deposited for the night.</p>
<p><i>Justice</i> announces, as you may have seen, that Reeves (a rather im- pecunious small man of Fleet St.) is going to publish a translation of Deville's extract of the <i>Capital</i> in 'numbers'. This is a dodge against our translation.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>If it comes out I shall have to declare that Devil- le's extract is anything but faithful or rather too faithful in the second half, giving all the conclusions and leaving out most of the premises and all the qualifications.</p>
<p>Fortin of Beauvais sends me the beginning of his translation of <i>The 18th Brumaire.</i> I have not yet had time to look at it.</p>
<p>I have nearly done dictating of the 3rd volume<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>—what can be dictated. Then, after my return from the seaside (end of August)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>comes first the sorting of the letters, etc. (and also of the books), and then the real work with the 3rd volume. Of the 2nd volume no news. If it does not come next week I shall write. These publishers always have some business pretext why a thing should not be brought out at once.</p>
<p>Mohr's trial at Cologne<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>is being reprinted in Zurich. Of the Russian translation [of] 2nd volume 18 sheets out of 33 are already done.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Now I must go to town on urgent private affairs (cash), so no more today from</p>
<p>Yours ever affectionately,</p>
<p>F. Engels

To begin with, Lafargue was kept in the cell reserved for criminals, but later transferred to the part of the prison where the political detainees were kept.</span>

At that time Engels was negotiating with the publish ers Kegan Paul and Co. about publishing the English translation of the first volume of<i> Capital</i> (see Note 56). These negotiations ended without success. Marx's work was put out by another publishing house and Deville's book did not appear in English.</span>

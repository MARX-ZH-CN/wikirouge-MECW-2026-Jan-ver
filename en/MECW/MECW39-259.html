MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 19 January 1855 28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Agree absolutely—and, indeed, most gratefully—to your scheme.</p>
<p>The parliamentary thing seems likely to misfire for reasons of time. BUT NEVER MIND.</p>
<p>Your yesterday's letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> didn't reach me until <i>4</i> <i>o'clock</i> <i>this</i> <i>afternoon</i> because the ass of a postman (this is the 2nd or 3rd time it has happened, and I shall complain to the POST OFFICE) delivered it to 28 Soho Square instead of 28 Dean Street. In future address your letters to 28 Dean Street, <i>Soho</i> <i>(instead</i> <i>of</i> <i>Soho</i> <i>Square)</i>. Because it arrived so late, I can write you no more than these few lines today.</p>
<p>What's this about Barthélémy? I missed it in the Augsburg paper.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Probably a fabrication on the part of the miserable 'Oly' or 'Ody', one of the Augsburg <i>Allgemeine</i> <i>Zeitung</i> correspondents, a blackguard from Switzerland.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i>.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>There's a tremendous panic in the City, and Freiligrath wrote yesterday telling me that even the most 'sanguine' expect things to be very bad until early spring.

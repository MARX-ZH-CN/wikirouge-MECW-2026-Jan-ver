ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>London, 24 May 1873</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>I wrote to Gumpert the day before yesterday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and gave him my opinion on your case, together with a brief account of what had happened (of course, I kept quiet about everything to do with the situation at home, merely saying that you had had a lot of vexation in various matters), just so that I should have done my bit to win my bet about the diagnosis. Today I received a letter from his eldest stepson saying that Gumpert wouldn't be back for 8-10 days and that he had sent my letter on to him.</p>
<p>Kept busy by Lafargue until 4.30<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> ; it got too late for me to send off a registered letter, so I shall send it on Monday with money so that you can use the time for excursions if you feel like it.</p>
<p>I also have the £50 here; should I give it to your wife? We shall be finished with Russia in a few days, except for a tiny detail for which I shall have to work my way through the Russian stuff, in doing which I have been constantly interrupted.</p>
<p>Regards to Moore<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> and Schorlemmer.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

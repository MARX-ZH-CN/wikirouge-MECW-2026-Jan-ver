<p>ENGELS TO M. R. COTAR<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN PARIS [Draft]</p>
<p>[London,] 8 April 1893<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dear Comrade,</p>
<p>I have kept your letter of 21/3 on one side for some time. Lafargue and Mrs Lafargue were on the point of coming over here and I therefore</p>
<p>wished to take the opportunity of consulting <i>both</i> Marx's daughters per- sonally about your inquiry.</p>
<p>You are totally unknown not only to me but also to the Lafargues, and you will understand that it wouldn't do to entrust a total stranger with a matter as important and as difficult as the French translation of Volume II of <i>Capital.</i></p>
<p>Apart from a thorough knowledge of the German language, it also calls for an equally thorough grounding in economics, and this, unfortunately, is to be found only very rarely amongst young socialists. That is something that would also have to be discussed beforehand.</p>
<p>Next, you seek my collaboration—and on this score all I can say to you is that for years to come my time will be fully occupied with projects that are of at least equal importance.</p>
<p>Most important of all, however, and this alone might give actuality to your inquiry, is that there should be a publisher for the translation. If you have one, that and nothing else would repay the trouble involved in taking the other questions into consideration.</p>
<p>Yours very truly
</p>

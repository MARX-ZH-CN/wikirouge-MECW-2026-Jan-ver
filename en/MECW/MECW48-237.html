ENGELS TO NIKOLAI DANIELSON</p>
<p>IN ST. PETERSBURG</p>
<p>London, 5 December 1889<br>
11 Burton Road Kilburn, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Immediately on receipt of your letter of the 14/26 November<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>I informed Mr Lafargue of its contents. He replies that he has written to you at once, saying that he never received any letters from the Lady<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>Editor of the <i>Northern Review,</i> that he places at her disposal 5 articles or any of them; as to the cutting out of certain passages of the article now in hand he says nothing <i>to me,</i> but if he should have omitted replying on that point, it seems to me clear that such must be left to her discretion. His address is</p>
<p>P. Lafargue, 60, Avenue des Champs Elysées Le Perreux</p>
<p>Seine, France</p>
<p>I now forward to you <i>registered</i> a copy of Th. Tooke, on the Currency Principle,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>London, 1844. This is a copy I bought second hand, it contains some pencil notes by the former owner, mostly confused stuff; also two old newspaper cuttings, one referring to the crisis of 1847 and rather interesting.</p>
<p>In the meantime I have got ready the 4th edition of Volume I<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>now in the press, there are two or three fresh additions from the French edition; the quotations have been looked over with the help of the English edition, and I have added a few notes of my own, especially one about Bimetallism.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>As soon as ready I shall forward you a copy.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely yours<br>
P. W. Rosher<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>

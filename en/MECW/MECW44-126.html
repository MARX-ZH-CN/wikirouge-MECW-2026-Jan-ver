MARX TO JENNY MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Brighton,] 25 August 1871</p>
<p>Dear Jenny,</p>
<p>I forgot to tell you yesterday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>of a curious <i>événement</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>The second day after my arrival here,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>I met a chap in a waiting posture at the corner of my street. He was the same man whom I had told you about before as having accompanied Engels and myself on our way HOME on a number of occasions. Engels had thought he was a spy and we once gave him a 'hint'. As you know, GENERALLY SPEAKING I am not good at detecting spies. But this fellow has obviously and undeniably dogged my every step down here. Yesterday, I became fed up with it, so I stopped, turned round and stared at him with my notorious EYEGLASS. WHAT DID HE DO? He doffed his hat very humbly and today he no longer honoured me with the pleasure of his company.</p>
<p>I wrote a detailed letter to Dana today giving him, among other things, an extensive account of the adventures in Luchon and Spain.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>He will certainly be able to use it for his <i>Sun.</i> It is EXACTLY THAT SORT OF THING THE YANKEES ARE FOND OF. I have of course dealt with the matter in terms which can do the children no harm—should they stay longer over there.</p>
<p>No one is so deaf as those who will not hear! And so OLD STEPNEY</p>
<p>IN REGARD TO THE REFUGEES! Jung and I told him the whole story without mincing words. Hales sent him subscription lists<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>I told him of the letter from Davydov,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>and lastly I advised him of the steps taken here to obtain subsidies. But for all that the old jackass has TILL NOW NOT LOOSENED HIS PURSE-STRINGS NOR SEEMS HE AT ALL WILLING TO DO so. Yesterday he told me with his eunuch's voice that he had sent subscription lists—to Boston, and he showed me a letter that he had written to a local lady, asking for contributions. But he himself! NOT HE!</p>
<p>The fellow is altogether 'off his head', as Jung says. Jung came here last Saturday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>and left again on Monday. He brought his two boys with him and before his departure he told Stepney that he was going to a family he knew of who would look after the boys. Stepney went with him and after Jung had SETTLED everything with the LANDLADY, Stepney said: 'BUT I WANT FOR <i>8</i> DAYS TO TAKE CARE OF THE BOYS MYSELF.' And so all was UNSETTLED again.</p>
<p>On the whole, the weather here has been stormy and rainy, so that I have not ceased to have colds with accompanying cough. But the wonderful air and the bath that I take daily have had a very good effect on my GENERAL STATE OF HEALTH. Throughout the whole period I have regretted nothing so much as the fact that you were not here. Anyhow, you must also—by hook or by crook—have, if not a summer trip, at least an autumn one this year.</p>
<p>As for those Swiss oafs, Schneider and Zichlinsky (the 'tailor'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>was a highly suspect individual even in Germany), they will soon realise that they are <i>not</i> in Germany any more.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>I find that too many Proudhonists are being admitted to the General Council, and on my return I shall insist on the admission of Martin and Le Moussu as an antidote.</p>
<p>Brighton—where, incidentally, I am living the life of a hermit on the whole—is naturally ABSORBED IN THE GREAT POISONING CASE, obviously a pure outbreak of hysterical boredom on the part of a SILLY, love-sick, 35-year-old SPINSTER in comfortable circumstances.</p>
<p>The reports by <i>The Daily News</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>and <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> PARIS CORRESPONDENTS on the Versailles trial<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup>are truly loathsome, infamous products of PENNY-A-LINERS.</p>
<p><i>Adio.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Karl

Marx, 'Letter to the Editor of <i>The Sun,</i> Charles Dana' and Jenny Marx's Letter to the Editor of<i> Woodhull &amp; Claflin's Weekly</i> (present edition, Vol. 22, pp. 396-99, 622).</span>

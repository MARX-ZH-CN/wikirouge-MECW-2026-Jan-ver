MARX TO JENNY MARX
<br>IN RAMSGATE
<br>[London,] 23 September 1871
<br>Dear Jenny,
<br>T h e Conference is at last coming to an end today.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> It was HARD WORK. Morning a n d evening sessions, commission sessions in between, HEARING OF WITNESSES, REPORTS TO BE DRAWN UP AND so FORTH. But more was done than at all the previous Congresses p u t together, because there was n o audience in front of which to stage rhetorical comedies. Germany was not represented and from Zwitzerland only Perret and Outine were there.
<br>Last week the revolutionary party in Rome held a banquet for Ricciotti Garibaldi, and a report on it in the Rome paper <i>La Capitale</i> has been sent to me. O n e speaker (<i>il signore</i> Luciani) proposed an enthusiastically received toast to the working class and to <b>Carlo Marx che (qui) se ne (en) è fatto (a fait) l'instancabile instrumenta (l'instrument infatigable)</b>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> This is a bitter pill for Mazzini!
<br>T h e news OF MY DEATH<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> led to a MEETING of the 'COSMOPOLITAN SOCIETY' in New York whose resolutions in the <i>World</i> I am sending to you.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> <br>Tussy has also received an anxious letter from o u r friends in St Petersburg.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> <br>We had a hard time here with Robin a n d Bastelica, Bakunin's friends and fellow-intriguers. T h e revelations about Robin's activities in Geneva and Paris were, INDEED, STRANGE.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> Jennychen's article was sent off to America today.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> <br>Your
<br>Karl

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 11 July 1857</p>
<p>DEAR Frederic,</p>
<p>The chief thing for you at present is naturally to recover your health. I shall have to see how I can put Dana off again. Don't worry your head about it. Next week I'll send you something on the military systems of Antiquity.</p>
<p><i>Hastings,</i> or so I hear, is the <i>only</i> resort in England that is of real benefit to complaints like yours. So <i>that's</i> where you must go, the time having come to tackle your illness seriously.—The <i>use of iron</i> to inhibit further development of the malady is at any rate rational, WHATEVER MR HECKSCHER MAY THINK OF IT. YOU ought to consult yet a third doctor about this too. Assuming that none of the chaps knows more than half of his job, it's advisable to check one against the other.</p>
<p>My wife is getting better. However, her condition still makes it difficult for me to leave the house.</p>
<p>The revolution marches on apace AS SHOWN BY THE MARCH OF THE Credit mobilier<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and Bonaparte's FINANCES IN GENERAL.</p>
<p>With best wishes for your recovery,</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.
</p>

The Crédit mobilier was to mediate in credit transactions and help in setting up industrial concerns and building railways in France, Spain, Austria, Russia and other countries. It was closely associated with Napoleon III's government and under its protection engaged in large-scale speculation. It went bankrupt in 1867 and was liquidated in 1871.</span>

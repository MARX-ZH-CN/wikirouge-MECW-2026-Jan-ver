MARX TO J. M. WEBER</p>
<p>IN BERLIN</p>
<p>London, 2 August 1860<br>9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, Haverstock Hill</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>I regret that, having been out of town for a few days, I did not receive your letter until today.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I enclose the sum of 32 Reichstalers, and, while tendering my best thanks for your careful attention to my affairs to date, would request you <i>to go ahead with the appeal in the Supreme Tribunal.</i> Though I do not expect to be successful, no stone should be left unturned in the endeavour to obtain <i>justice.</i> Legally the argument put forward by the High Court appears to me to be quite untenable.</p>
<p>I should be exceedingly grateful if you would send me <i>by return</i> your petition of 21.6.60 or, should the latter have to remain on the files for the time being, ask your secretary to make a summary of the charges contained therein (along with a list of the documents supporting the individual charges) and remit me the same.</p>
<p>I have, Sir, the honour to be</p>
<p>Your obedient Servant</p>
<p>Dr Karl Marx

ENGELS TO WALERY WRÖBLEWSKI<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 4 December 1875, midday<br>122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>My dear Wroblewski,</p>
<p>This morning I awoke with so violent a cold in the head that it almost prevents me from talking. Hence, to my great regret, it will not be possible for me to attend your Polish meeting tonight, the more so since the evening promises to be one which will combine all the advantages of the Polish climate with the pleasures of an English fog.</p>
<p>My feelings for the cause of the Polish people, feelings to which I am sorry not to be able to give expression tonight, will always remain the same; I shall always regard the liberation of Poland as being one of the foundation stones of the ultimate liberation of the European proletariat and, in particular, of the liberation of the other Slav nationalities. So long as the division and the subjection of the Polish people continues, so, too, will endure and reproduce itself with fatal inevitability the Holy Alliance between those who partitioned Poland, an alliance which signifies nothing but bondage for the Russian, Hungarian and German peoples, just as it does for the Polish people. Long Live Poland!</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>F. Engels

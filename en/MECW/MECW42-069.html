MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London] 18 March 1865</p>
<p>DEAR FRED, There are a lot of things, some of them important, that I want to write to you about. But as there's A VERY GREAT DEAL OF BUSINESS to do in connection with my departure tomorrow,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>just the following bare facts:</p>
<p>The remaining HALVES of the notes received. You can send the POST OFFICE order to my wife. I've sent off a note from Bender asking for 50 copies, etc., of your pamphlet,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>etc., to <i>O. Meissner</i> direct, as I had to write to him today. It is possible that Meissner's answer may arrive <i>too late</i> for the <i>next Londoner Anzeiger.</i> Since Bender does at present without doubt know best how to disseminate things of this kind in England, you should send him <i>a note about the price of the pamphlet</i> by return if you can (i.e. if you know it yourself). He will then advertise it straightaway in the next number. His address is 8 Little Newport St., Leicester Square.</p>
<p>I did a short, highly condensed little article for Bender, such as I thought would be suitable for his paper,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>a kind of prospectus of contents, and sent Juch conversely, contrariwise and notwithstanding, just your pamphlet itself, asking him to do a critique of it in his own way and according to his own point of view.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>Then I received enclosed note from Juch <i>(to be kept).</i> There certainly wasn't the time for a critical review. So, I sent the notice originally intended for Bender (in today's <i>Hermann</i>) to Juch<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>(and the enclosed message to Bender instead<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>). At the same time, I wrote to Juch—diplomacy becoming increasingly important—that I couldn't meet his request because I was going away, that he should print copious extracts in a later number; I would discuss his difficulty in finding contributors with him when I returned to London. (I am thinking of placing Eccarius there, instead of with the <i>Social-Demokrat</i>) I sent him ditto a copy of my statement against Schweitzer,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>although the <i>Hermann</i> won't be able to print it until next Saturday's edition (copies sent at the same time to <i>Reform</i> in Berlin and to the <i>Düsseldorfer Zeitung</i>); no amendments in the version for the <i>Hermann</i> except a stab at Blind inserted at the beginning.</p>
<p>Bender has written to me ditto:</p>
<p>'Most obliged and grateful for notice you sent; but we now need a review as well.'</p>
<p>I've passed this on to Eccarius. Also enclosed a number of the <i>Rheinische Zeitung</i> sent to me by Liebknecht with HIS SPEECH.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>His wife<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>has written to mine; they are really down on their luck. He still owed the <i>Social-Demokrat £5,</i> etc. I can't send him anything at the present moment. <i>Nordstern</i> enclosed. You must <i>keep</i> this document. You can see these gentlemen are now trying to make out that that wretch Schweitzer completely <i>falsified</i> Lassalle.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>So, my statement against Schweitzer, which also repudiates Lassalle, even though very indirectly, comes at a most opportune moment. It will all come out in the wash by and by.</p>
<p>It appears from the enclosed letter from Bruhn that I was right about Frisch.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup>I've sent him the 6 talers (not 60!), although I'm not convinced by it, at the same time saying that I would 'make further enquiries' regarding the 50, etc.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>Apropos. <i>Klings</i> called in on his way to America. He had all kinds of interesting things to report to me. A real 'Rhineland' worker.</p>
<p>On <i>5 March</i> the <i>Cologne</i> branch of the <i>General Workers' Association</i> decided to issue a protest (along the lines of our statement<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup>) against the <i>Social-Demokrat,</i> and <i>against B. Becker</i> as well, who is a kind of Biscamp Secundus. They have <i>STOPPED THE MONEY SUPPLIES.</i> And this refusal to pay taxes is catching.

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN RAMSGATE</p>
<p>[London,] 8 September 1871</p>
<p>Dear FRED,</p>
<p>Allsop's address is <i>Pegwell Bay.</i> No number has been given nor is it needed. EVERYBODY WILL TELL YOU THE WHEREABOUTS OF Pegwell Bay. It is a good thing that you can speak to him since he is coming to London on Tuesday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>with the money and has invited me to come and see him there. I have written to him at length and made it clear that I can only continue TO BE THE <i>aumônier</i> OF HIMSELF AND his FRIENDS if I am allowed complete freedom of action AND am NOT BOTHERED WITH THE DEMAND TO PRODUCE LISTS OF THE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF DISTRESS of the refugees.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>What do you think of our honourable Favre? The lousy London press now has to report its own disgrace by telegraph.</p>
<p>Last Monday <i>L'Avenir liberal</i>—<i>journal bonapartiste, publié à Paris</i>—reported my death.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In consequence we have received a number of letters; among others, Dronke wrote to my wife today, and Imandt too sent the <i>Dundee Advertiser</i> which contained the same nonsense. À <i>demain</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>CALL UPON ME AFTER YOUR ARRIVAL AT LONDON. Regards to the WHOLE FAMILY.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>Rochat does a splendid imitation of Frankel's French.</p>
<p><i>The Evening Standard</i> of 6 September <i>only published the letter to the EDITOR,</i> adding the note: 'WE HAVE RECEIVED NO ENCLOSURE.'</p>
<p>I did not see the stuff until yesterday. Since the letters to the fellows were in your handwriting<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>I got my wife to write to them at once in her own name, on the pretext that I was out of London for a few days. She has sent the <i>Public Opinion</i> (and REGISTERED the letter), and demanded that it be printed together with an <i>apologie,</i> under threat of legal proceedings. She put in an 'old' card with it, which reads: 'Mme Jenny Marx, née Baronesse de Westphalen', which will be bound to put fear into those Tories.

ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT</p>
<p>IN LEIPZIG</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London, 11 April 1877]</p>
<p>Dear Liebknecht,</p>
<p>I have today received your letter of the 9th. It's the same old story. First you make all kinds of promises, whereupon exactly quite the opposite happens and then, if I complain, I hear nothing from you for a fortnight and I'm told that you had too much to do and would I kindly spare you my unnecessary objurgations. IT IS ADDING INSULT TO INJURY.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>So often has this comedy been played that I refuse to tolerate another performance.</p>
<p>My letter of yesterday, which will be in Leipzig first thing tomorrow morning, will get to you on 13 Friday,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>and I expect an immediate reply to my questions. My reply to yours will depend on your reply to these, i.e. if by then there is any need at all for a reply from me.</p>
<p>If, by the evening of 17 Tuesday, I have had no reply, or no adequate one, from you, I shall no longer be able to show you any consideration and shall myself see to it that such articles of mine as remain are not mismanaged as hitherto. In which case it might very well happen that, in the course of things, I shall sooner or later find it necessary to air the whole business in public.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

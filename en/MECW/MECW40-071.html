<p>MARX TO COLLET DOBSON COLLET<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Draft] [London, after 10 June 1857]</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Having myself not made up, but only copied the account forwarded to you, I felt, on receiving your note, very anxious, indeed, lest my claims should have been overstated. Consequently,</p>
<p>I reexamined the reckonings. The case is simply this, that you make 22<sup>2</sup>/3 columns, that you have omitted No. 34,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and that the only mistake on my part consists in having put down 4 columns for No. 34, which really amounts to 5<sup>1</sup>/2 columns.</p>
<p>Yours truly</p>
<p>K. Marx</p>
<p>D. Collet, Esq.

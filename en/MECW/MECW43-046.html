ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 21 July 1868</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>I concluded from Tussy's letter the receipt of the £10, and also that both patients<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>must have reached the point at which they should be sent to the SEASIDE, the sooner the better. So that there shall be no delay I enclose £25 (1 of 20 and 1 of 5). It is still uncertain when I shall get away from here, and it will therefore be better for the time being to drop the attempt at a combined SEASIDE operation, so that the girls' health may not suffer.</p>
<p>I believe you said recently that Borkheim himself would be inclined to advance the £150 if he was not at the moment short of money. Is he now perhaps in a position to provide the sum, or at least £100? It would be absolute folly to toss into the maw of this miserable society 20% interest per annum against the finest security. Even if Borkheim can get us only £100, of which £50 might be repaid in case of need in January or February and the rest on 10/20 July 1869 (though it would be best if <i>the whole sum</i> need not be repaid until next July), everything could be fixed up easily. He really only needs to commit himself to pay £100 on the loan in September, so that I would then only need to send him the <i>remainder.</i> This would free £100 for me, which I could send you right now. If nothing of this sort happens, you will understand that I am very tied, as long as the heavy load of £175 is hanging over my head, and especially as long as I do not know how the balance has come out, and I probably won't know for another 3-4 weeks.</p>
<p>Think over the business with Borkheim. Maybe something can be done; if so we would be, at least for the time being, out of all our troubles, and would once again have gained time.</p>
<p>The pamphlets and journals I sent back to you yesterday. Who is this sultry Dr Boruttau, who displays such a sensitive organ for sexual love?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jones is hard put to it whether to stand for Manchester or for Dewsbury.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>The Dewsburyans have sent him a requisition signed by 2,000 voters; he wants 1,000 more since there will be 6,000 voters. Now they are pressing <i>here</i> in Manchester whether he will accept or not. Best greetings.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

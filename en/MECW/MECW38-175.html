TO MARX IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester,] Thursday [15 May 1851]</p>
<p>Dear Marx,</p>
<p>Last week I sent off a whole SHIP-LOAD of letters to you, among them 1 containing money and 1 through Pieper. Then last Tuesday, yet another, to which I was expecting an answer at least today. <i>Pas une ligne</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I can only suppose that all the letters went astray, since I had at least expected an answer to the one sent through Pieper; its failure to arrive has put me in an awkward position vis-a-vis the postmaster here. Or else there's been some mishap, in which case, too, <i>deux mots</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> would be welcome since I'm <i>considerablement</i> worried by the business and, unless I hear from you tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow at the latest, I shan't know what's the matter, or how I should arrange for letters to reach you without going astray.</p>
<p>The postmaster here has asked that in future you should not address your letters as up till now, but like this: at the top, the name, beneath it, number and street and, right at the bottom, Manchester. He blames this for the fact that a recent letter of yours made the return journey to London and then back here again. An answer by return, then.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

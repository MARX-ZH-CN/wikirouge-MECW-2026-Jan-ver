<blockquote>
<p>Engels wrote this draft after the General Council recognised the Ferrara workers' society as a section of the International (see Note 105). Engels put it down on the clean third page of the letter from the Ferrara society of April 27, in which its members, in reply to Engels' letter of April 16 (see this volume, pp. 146-47), agreed to interprète their autonomy in accordance with the Rules of the International. There is a note by Engels on the fourth page: "Ferrara 27 aprile 72. Sezione di Ferrara. Btw. 10 Mai" (Ferrara, April 27, 72. Section of Ferrara. Answered May 10). The full text of Engels' letter to the Ferrara society has not been found.</p>
<p>An excerpt from this document was published in English for the first time in The Hague Congress of the First International. September 2-7, 1872. Reports and Letters, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1978.

<p>Confirmation given that the reservation concerning autonomy is sufficiently outlined in this letter. Promise to send all our publications.</p>

<p>I inform that the General Council will soon devote itself to preparations for the Congress and that the Congress will take place in September.

ENGELS TO RICHARD FISCHER</p>
<p>IN BERLIN</p>
<p>London, 2 February 1895<br>
41 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Fischer,</p>
<p>You and the others have an odd way of holding a pistol to a fellow's head. Having made your plans for Marx's articles, you really might have told me about them a bit sooner rather then at the very last moment. 507 In a case such as this, where I am the administrator of other people's property, I <i>cannot</i> rush things in the same way as I could if the matter simply concerned myself. Added to that, I am at this moment getting Lassalle's letters 284 ready for you and these are far more likely to fall foul of the Subversion Bill 428 than Marx's articles—the <i>latter,</i> then, is the work I ought to put on one side!</p>
<p>So tell me first of all what format and type you are using and how large the edition is to be, also the selling price, for on this occasion I shall, for various reasons, only sell you the right to <i>one</i> edition of a <i>specific size.</i> Meanwhile I shall have a word with Tussy; as soon as I get your reply, I shall let you know for certain.</p>
<p>If you cannot advise me of the exact selling price, it will be sufficient if you say how much you propose to charge per printed sheet.</p>
<p>I assume that you have a copy of the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i>—<i>Revue</i> from which to reprint. For I myself do not possess one of my own and if I did I couldn't let it out of my hands.</p>
<p>Now for another matter. When the <i>Vorwärts</i> set up its bookselling side, August<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>wrote to say that I would be sent <i>two copies</i> of all your publications. Of late, however, that has been very far from the case. For instance, I have <i>not</i> received your latest edition of the <i>Manifesto,</i> or indeed either of the Berlin editions. 508 I am still short of sundry lesser pieces and am listing those that immediately spring to mind. You would greatly oblige me by sending them to me, namely your <i>reprint of the Subversion Debate</i> in two parts<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>and a <i>couple</i> of copies of the most recent edition of the <i>Communist Manifesto.</i>— As regards the other things I am short of, I have just seen from your list that you are not to blame, since you were not the publisher. Apart from the above I am still short of</p>
<p>Minutes of the <i>Wyden</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>Congress, 1880 343</p>
<p>" " <i>Brussels</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>" 1891 228 and one on <i>Zurich 229</i> if it was you who published it. 509</p>
<p>The list I used for comparison was issued in 1893 and it is therefore possible that one thing or another may still be missing.</p>
<p>So please let me have the information by return and I shall send you a definite answer as promptly as possible.</p>
<p>Give my kindest regards to your wife and children and all my friends.</p>
<p>Yours</p>
<p>F.E.

<blockquote>
<p>These propositions were submitted by Marx to the General Council at its meeting on September 5, 1871 and approved by it. The available manuscript, written by Engels, has a correction in Marx's hand. The words "Financial account" at the beginning of the manuscript related to the proposal that the General Council should prepare the accounts for the Conference.</p>
<p>They were published in English for the first time in The General Council of the First International. 1870-1871. Minutes, Moscow, 1967.

<p>Financial account.</p>
<p>1) To find a room for the meetings of the Conference.</p>
<p>2) To find an hotel where the members of the Conference can stay—propose the same as last, Leicester Square.</p>
<p>3) A Committee to be appointed to arrange these two points.</p>
<p>4) That the entire Council assist at the meetings of the Conference, with the right of taking part in the debate, but that a certain number of the Council only be delegated with the right of voting—such number to be fixed by the Council when the number of delegates to the Conference shall be known.</p>
<p>5) That the Frenchmen now resident in London who are acknowledged members of the International, provide for the representation of France at the Conference by three delegates.</p>
<p>6) That if the members of any Country should not be represented at the Conference, the Corresponding Secretary for that Country be appointed to represent them.

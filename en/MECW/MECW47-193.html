ENGELS TO HERMANN SCHLÜTER 4 3 9</p>
<p>IN HOTTINGEN-ZURICH</p>
<p>Jersey, 26 August 1885
31 Roseville Street</p>
<p>Dear Mr Schlüter,</p>
<p>Sheets 16 and 17<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> arrived in London after I had left—the Kautskys and Avelings were also away so there was no one there capable of sending on the large quantity of incoming printed matter in some semblance of order. It was not until Monday that Mrs Aveling arrived at my house and posted me the sheets. These went back to you corrected yesterday, Wednesday. A lot of words had been inserted that do not appear in the original and they completely distort the sense. And on sheet 17 in particular the pages are in a complete muddle: 257, 262, 263, 258, 259, 264, etc., which is totally inadmissible in this, the most important chapter of the book, and that is why I have taken the precaution of writing to you.</p>
<p>I shall be staying here for another fortnight.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <i>After Saturday, 3 September</i> everything had best be sent to London again.—We are literally stifling here during the present spell of fine weather, for the lack of rain has led to a serious water shortage on this pretty little island. I neither see nor hear anything of the party, which, if the latest storm in the parliamentary tea cup 374 is anything to go by, is no calamity. Kindest regards to Ede.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F.E.

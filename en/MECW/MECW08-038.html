<p><i>Cologne,</i> November 28. In its issue of November 17 the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> stated:</p>
<p>"And as for the <i>Jews,</i> who since the emancipation of their sect have everywhere put themselves, at least in the person of their eminent representatives, at the <i>head of the counter-revolution</i> — what awaits them? There has been no waiting for victory in order to throw them back into their ghetto."</p>
<p>At the time, we quoted government decrees from <i>Bromberg</i>. Today we have a still more striking fact to report. The big "Three Crowns" masonic lodge in Berlin — it is well known that the <i>Prince of Prussia</i> is the supreme head of the Prussian freemasons, just as <i>Frederick William IV</i> is the supreme head of the Prussian religion — has put a stop to the activity of the <i>Minerva</i> lodge in Cologne. Why? <i>Because it has Jews among</i> its <i>members. Let the Jews take note of this!</i></p>
<p>A circular of the Brandenburg Ministry to all administrative bodies, which we came upon by chance, calls upon them to carry out <i>mass arrests of the leaders of the clubs.</i></p>
<p>We are assured from a trustworthy source that <i>Cologne, Düsseldorf, Aachen etc.</i> will be given imperial troops, in fact <i>Austrians</i>, as a Christmas present from our most gracious sovereign. Probably they will include <i>Croats, Serezhans, Czechs, Raizes, Serbs etc.,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> so that "order and calm" will be established in the Rhine Province as in Vienna. By the way, people say that the Rhine Province borders not on <i>Russia</i> but on <i>France</i>. <i>Let the most gracious sovereign take note of this!</i>

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The Austrian troops of Windischgrätz and Jellachich which suppressed the Vienna uprising were mostly recruited from the South-Slav peoples. <i>Serezhans</i> — special units in border regiments (200 men per regiment) recruited in the Serbian and Croatian regions of the Military Border Area. In peacetime they protected the frontier and in wartime fulfilled vanguard, outpost and patrol duties. <i>Raizes</i> (<i>Raizen, Razen, Rascier</i>) — the name given to the Orthodox Serbs and often used for Serbs in general. It is apparendy derived from the name of one of the first settlements of Serbian tribes, the ancient town Rassa, centre of the Raschka region</span>

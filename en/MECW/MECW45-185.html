MARX TO WILHELM BRACKE</p>
<p>IN BRUNSWICK</p>
<p>[London,] 1 August 1877</p>
<p>Dear Bracke,</p>
<p>I shall be leaving London at the end of this week or the beginning of next and going to the Continent since my state of health necessitates my taking a cure.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> In the meantime I have been forbidden work of any kind and you will therefore have to look elsewhere for someone to revise the translation of Lissagaray's book,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> since <i>without revision</i> the thing's unprintable. (C. Hirsch might be able to suggest someone to you.)</p>
<p>Needless to say, Lissagaray finds the month's hiatus, during which you have failed to communicate with him, far from edifying and I consider his grievance to be fully justified.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>K. M.

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Considering it very important to familiarise workers with the true history of the Paris Commune, Marx became actively involved in the commissioning of a German translation of a book written by one of its members, Prosper Olivier Lissagaray, <i>Histoire de la Commune de 1871.</i> He requested Wilhelm Bracke, and Engels asked Wilhelm Bios to find somebody to do the job. The sample translation done by Julius Grunzig failed to satisfy Marx, as did that by Isolde Kurz. Although Marx was already overburdened with work, he had to spend a great deal of time and effort editing the translation. In the autumn of 1877, on Marx's and Engels' proposal, Wilhelm Bios was recruited as another editor. Lissagaray's book appeared in German in Brunswick late in 1877.</span>

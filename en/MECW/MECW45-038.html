MARX TO MAURICE LACHÂTRE</p>
<p>IN BRUSSELS</p>
<p>London, 30 January 1875</p>
<p>Dear Citizen,</p>
<p>I have today sent off to Paris the last part of the manuscript,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> save only for the afterword, the table of contents and the <i>errata,</i> none of which can be done until I have before me those FASCICLES which have not yet been published.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>I agree that it would be best to <i>publish</i> the last FASCICLES together, but that does not explain why Mr Lahure should have ceased <i>printing</i> three months ago. (He hasn't even sent me back the proofs of instalments 34 and 35.) I am hard-pressed by other work and am receiving letter after letter from my German,<sup>3</sup> and likewise my Russian,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> publisher, urging me to complete the final editing of the second volume.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> So if, instead of printing and sending me the proofs as they come off the press, Mr Lahure continues to procrastinate, he alone will be to blame for any new delays and interruptions that may result. Not being desirous of writing further to that gentleman, I would request you to let him have your instructions.</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

Between October 1869 and April 1870, he translated about 400 pages which he sent to Marx for editing, After the defeat of the Paris Commune, however, Keller was forced to emigrate to Switzerland, where he embraced Bakuninist views, after which Marx terminated co-operation with him.<br>In December 1871, Paul Lafargue assisted Marx in concluding a contract for the publication of<i> Capital</i> with the progressive French journalist and publisher Maurice Lachâtre. The contract was signed on 15 February 1872. Under it,<i> Capital</i> was to appear in 44 instalments, one printer's sheet each. The work appeared between 1872 and 1875 in two instalments at a time, but was sold in series of five instalments each, making nine series in all.<br>The last instalments having come out, the series were stitched together and sold as separate books.<br>The first volume of<i> Capital</i> was translated into French by Joseph Roy. Marx did not think much of the effort and made a vast number of alterations, in fact, revised the book. As he himself said, the authorised French translation had an independent scientific value alongside the German original.<br>In this edition, the first volume of<i> Capital</i> is published in Engels' authorised English translation with the interpolations from the French edition given in the Appendix (see present edition, Vol. 35).</span>

<li id="cite_note-4"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-4">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Following the publication of Part One of<i> A Contribution to the Critique of Political  Economy</i> in 1859 (see present edition, Vol. 29), Marx wrote a lengthy economic manuscript in 1861-63. It was a second rough draft of<i> Capital</i> (the first being the 1857-58 manuscript). In 1863, he definitively decided that the work was to have four books, the first three being theoretical, and the fourth, presenting a historical and critical survey. In August 1863, having completed work on the manuscript of 1861-63, Marx began preparing<i> Capital</i> for the press.<br>This work resulted in a third rough draft of<i> Capital</i>—the Economic Manuscript of 1863-65, consisting of three theoretical books. The draft for the fourth book<i> (Theories of Surplus Value)</i> formed part of the 1861-63 manuscript. Subsequently, Marx returned to the first book. On Engels' advice, Marx decided it would be the first to be published, and was preparing it for the press throughout 1866 and the first half of 1867. The first German edition of the book appeared in September 1867 as Volume One of<i> Capital.</i> Under the plan agreed with the publisher Otto Meissner, the second and third books, analysing the process of circulation of capital and the forms of capitalist process as a whole, were to appear as Volume Two, and the fourth book, dealing with 'the history of economic theories', as the third and final volume of<i> Capital. </i><br>Marx, however, did not manage to prepare the second and third volumes of <i>Capital</i> for the press. After his death, Engels completed the work and published Marx's manuscripts of the second and third books as Volume Two (1885) and Volume Three (1894). Engels also intended to prepare for the press and publish the above-mentioned manuscript of the fourth book as Volume Four of<i> Capital</i> but died before this plan had been carried out. In the present edition of the<i> Collected Works</i> of Marx and Engels, this book of<i> Capital</i> has been included in the Economic Manuscript of 1861-63 (vols 30-34), while the first three volumes of<i> Capital</i> make up vols 35-37 respectively.</span>

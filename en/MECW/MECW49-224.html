ENGELS TO LUDWIG SCHORLEMMER</p>
<p>IN DARMSTADT</p>
<p>London, 16 June 1892</p>
<p>Dear Mr Schorlemmer,</p>
<p>I have received your letter of the 7th this month and have also heard from Gumpert who tells me he has had a line or two from you. Of Carl<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> he further says:</p>
<p>'As before, he suffers no pain at all, takes enough nourishment and sleeps well on the whole. During the past few days his faculties have been very clouded and he often forgets what has just happened.'</p>
<p>Otherwise there was no change. Not having heard from Gumpert since, I cannot be sure whether or not there has been any material change, but thought I would allay your anxiety by passing on the above note.</p>
<p>With cordial regards, in which I am joined by Mrs Kautsky, to you and all your family.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F. Engels

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 29 June 1853
28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>My sister<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>and her newly wedded husband<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>, who is sailing from here to the Cape of Good Hope as a GENERAL DEALER, have unexpectedly descended on me. This, combined with the work for the <i>Tribune</i> and some unpleasantness to be cleared up in America, has made considerable demands on my time. The couple set out tomorrow, I believe. I hear from Imandt that your mother is expected in London, from which I conclude that you, too, will turn up soon.</p>
<p>Enclosed Lassalle's instructions for the dispatch of the copies<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>to Germany. My wife will undertake their dispatch to Manchester. I hope that you people will then take care of the matter up there. Haven't you seen anything of Jones? He's roaming about in your part of the world and is said to have brought off a MONSTER MEETING in Halifax.408</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, much to my astonishment, I received a very peevish letter from Cluss, in which he said someone had written telling him that Pieper had described him to Schläger—him and Arnold—as 'subordinate agents', and himself, on the contrary, as the one who supplied news 'at first-hand', etc., etc. Fortunately there isn't <i>a word of truth</i> in the whole thing, which is merely an attempt by Willich, Anneke, Weitling and Co.'s party to sow dissension amongst our own ranks, and, more particularly, to neutralise 'that most unpleasant man, Cluss'. The necessary explanations were, of course, dispatched across the water at once.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>I am unable to find Cluss' first letter, but enclose the 2nd.</p>
<p>Before leaving for Manchester<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>I borrowed £2 from the little Jew Bamberger. The fellow keeps sending me strongly-worded reminders, if not threats. <i>Mais nous verrons</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>By Friday I shall have £20 to draw on New York. But again the question is how?</p>
<p>Enclosed the <i>nee plus ultra</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>of Heinzen's now sanguinary cowardice and aversion to 'ordinary methods of warfare'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>I was mistaken about the 'Swiss article', Dana having divided the thing into two parts,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>but published both under my name.</p>
<p>Until next time, then. My worthy sister and brother-in-law have just come in. My sister is very stout and will sweat damnably while crossing the Equator.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

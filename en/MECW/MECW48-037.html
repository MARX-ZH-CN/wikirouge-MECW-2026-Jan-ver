ENGELS TO FLORENCE KELLEY-WISCHNEWETZKY<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>IN NEW YORK</p>
<p>London, 28 May 1887</p>
<p>Dear Mrs Wischnewetzky,</p>
<p>I find both <i>Injustice</i> and <i>Sozialdemokrat</i> of this week a notice of the English <i>Lage,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> but have myself up to now not received a single copy, nor even seen the book. There seems to be some queer management some- where, which may want looking into by you.—Just this moment Karl Kautsky comes in and says he has received a box with 18 copies, of which he kindly places a few at my disposal, so that I have at least a chance of a look at the book.</p>
<p>I am informed that the London Agent<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> of Mr Lovell is the firm which specially represents Bismarckism in the London Book Trades. This cannot of course be helped but is an unfortunate circumstance for us. Translation of preface<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> just too late for this Steamer, per next mail certain.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully</p>
<p>F. E.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Engels wrote this letter on a postcard. The address, written by him on the back, reads Mrs. F. Kelly-Wischnewetzky, 110, East 76th St., New York, U.S. America. For data on the first publication of the letter in English see note 139.</span>

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">In a letter dated 10 December 1886 Kelley-Wischnewetzky asked Engels to write a preface to the American edition of The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, which she had translated into English. She argued that Engels' Afterword, written for this edition in February 1886, was out of date (see present edition, Vol. 26), and suggested that the new preface should, above all, contain a critique of Henry George and that the words 'in 1844' should be omitted from the title. In reply to her request Engels wrote the article 'The Labor Movement in America', which was to open the book.</span>

<li id="cite_note-4"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-4">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Kelley-Wischnewetzky had suggested that Engels's article, 'Die Arbeiterbewegung in America' ('The Labour Movement in America'), written as a preface to the US edition of The Condition of the Working Class in England, should be issued in the form of separate German and English pamphlets. This was also suggested by Sorge in his letter of 26 April 1887. Engels translated the preface into German himself. The pamphlets appeared in New York in July 1887. Engels's German translation was also published in the Sozialdemokrat, Nos 24 and 25; 10 and 17 June 1887.</span>

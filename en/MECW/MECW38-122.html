<p>London, 29 October 1850</p>
<p>64 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Weydemeyer,</p>
<p>I beg you to carry out the following transaction for me:</p>
<p>Borrow from Schuster or somebody else the money necessary to redeem my silver from the Frankfurt pawnbroker's,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>then sell the silver to a goldsmith or wherever it can be sold in Frankfurt, repay the man who loaned you the money for redeeming the silver, and send the balance to me here.</p>
<p>Neither you nor the other man will be incurring any risk for, should you not be able to sell the stuff at a higher price, all you have to do is take it back to the pawnbroker's.</p>
<p>On the other hand my present circumstances are such that I must at all costs raise some money, even to be able to continue working.</p>
<p>The only items I would ask you to return to the pawnbroker's, since they have no saleable value, are 1) a small silver mug, 2) a silver plate, 3) a small knife and fork in a case—all belonging to little Jenny.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>I very much approve of your plan for a popular work on political economy and only hope that you will soon make a start on it.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Warm regards to your wife<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>from my wife and self.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. Marx

This work was published in New York in April-August 1853 in the German newspaper Die Reform under the title 'National-ökonomische Skizzen'.</span>

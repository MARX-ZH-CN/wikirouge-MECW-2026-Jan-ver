MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 22 January 1870</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>I am only writing you THESE FEW LINES today, since my left arm is under bandages and POULTICES, that is to say, not under my command.</p>
<p>The business was an ABSCESS connected with the GLANDS. In addition, a few other little things, which were put in order yesterday by being lanced. Today, everything in best progress; the doctor was fully satisfied.</p>
<p>The port, which arrived yesterday, is doing me a great service. You should not imagine that I have learned so much Russian IN A FEW WEEKS; I won't say as much as you have forgotten, but as much as would remain to you had you forgotten three times as much. I am still a beginner.</p>
<p>So Herzen is dead. Just about time I finished <i>TwpbMa</i> etc.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Plenty of things have happened in the 'International', especially with regard to Bakunin's intrigues.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> But too long to write about now.</p>
<p>The Paris MOVEMENTS are amusing.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Since Ollivier is also a FREE TRADER, he is naturally a man after the heart of the English philistine, who always forgets that what suits him must be, <i>prima facie,</i><sup>h</sup> DISGUSTING to French Frenchmen.</p>
<p>MY COMPLIMENTS TO MRS Lizzie AND ALL OF THEM.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Moor</p>
<p>What do you say to the clever-clever stuff in <i>Zukunft,</i> by means of which they attempt to push themselves out of the purely political camp!</p>
<p>Apropos. I still have a little note from Liebknecht<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> which arrived for you during your absence from England. But I can't look it out now amongst the mess of papers. Next time.

On page 196 Marx wrote: 'Finished 9 January 1870'. The copy is kept at the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam.</span>

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Having failed to move to the forefront in the International's leadership at the Basle Congress (see Note 379), Bakunin altered his tactics and launched an open campaign against the General Council. His followers came to form the majority in <i>L'Egalité</i> weekly published in Switzerland, and as early as 6 November 1869, No. 42 carried an editorial 'Le Bulletin du Conseil Général', accusing the General Council of violating articles 2 and 3 of the Regulations on the publication of an information bulletin dealing with the conditions of workers in various countries. On 13 November, No. 43 published another article, 'L'Organisation de l'Internationale', which proposed the establishment of a federal council for England, allegedly to make it easier for the General Council to manage the more general affairs of the International. On 27 November, No. 45 featured an article 'Les Parties Politiques à Genève et l'Internationale', which suggested abstention from politics, and on 11 December, <i>L'Égalité</i> No. 47 lashed out against the Council's position on the Irish question in the editorial entitled 'Réflexions'. <i>Le Progrès</i> newspaper, which was published in Switzerland, assumed a similarly critical stand.<br>The question of <i>L'Egalité</i> and <i>Le Progrès</i> was discussed at the General Council for the first time at a meeting of 14 December 1869. On 1 January 1870, an extraordinary Council meeting approved a circular letter, drawn up by Marx, 'The General Council to the Federal Council of Romance Switzerland', which was sent out to the International's sections (see present edition, Vol. 21, p. 84).</span>

<li id="cite_note-4"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-4">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">In a letter of 20 December 1869, Liebknecht asked Engels for permission to reprint his work <i>The Peasant War in Germany</i> (see present edition, Vol. 10, pp. 397-482) in <i>Der Volksstaat,</i> and subsequently as a separate pamphlet. He also asked for a short preface to the work.<br>Liebknecht's letter of 8 February 1870 shows that Engels had given his consent. The preface (see present edition, Vol. 21, p. 93) and five chapters appeared in <i>Der Volksstaat</i> between 2 April and 25 June 1870; in October 1870 the work was published as a pamphlet.</span>

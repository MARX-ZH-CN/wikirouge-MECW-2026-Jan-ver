MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>London, 5 April 1869</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>I can't make anything of your <i>snieunt</i> (I can't read the following letters) <i>jown</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> According to the etymology, I can only explain <i>lucus a non lucendo</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> that in Danish <i>snoe</i> means turn, and <i>jeon</i> means EVEN.</p>
<p>I congratulate you on the energy with which you have cut the umbilical cord with Dover Street.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Laura is quite well again. Jenny will be coming home tomorrow or the day after 'for business reasons'. Tussy will stay in Paris for at least 2 months. As you will note from the enclosed letter, she is absolutely delighted with Fouschtra,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> the YOUNGSTER of the Lafargue FAMILY.</p>
<p>The Wilhelm-Bebel-Schweitzer clash of words has not really been so bad; after all, when of 11,000 voters, 4,500 abstained from voting <i>for</i> Schweitzer, this was not exactly a triumph for this gentleman.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>With regard to the <i>Citizen</i>, the contributors to which include Dr Engel of Berlin and Dr Brentano of the same, this appears to be stillborn or, as OLD Werner says, 'laid out'. Lloyd Jones is an old tailor by trade, who figured in a STRIKE back in 1824. For a long time now he has been an apostle of cooperation, and a lazy-bones. Odger and Applegarth are both possessed by a mania for mediation and a longing for respectability. On the CENTRAL COUNCIL, we ticked off Mr Applegarth properly.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> With regard to Odger's <i>collaboration</i> in particular, it never went further than the prospectus, and here people simply laugh at such PROMISSORY BILLS on his part.</p>
<p>In 2 issues the Bonapartist <i>Peuple</i> (directly edited <i>with</i> Boustrapa<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> ) denounces our International because of the recent exercises of terrorism in Geneva<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> (on the occasion of the typographers' STRIKE<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> ), and, at the same time, makes mocking remarks about our impotence. It would naturally be very good to keep the volcanic explosion on such a small but conspicuous stage, <i>if the means were available.</i> But to drag in the International so directly, as Becker<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> and Co. are doing, without preparation, without thinking about a war-chest, without taking into consideration the good or bad state of business in Europe—this is simply compromising. I shall send you the relevant numbers of <i>Peuple</i> after I have presented them to the COUNCIL tomorrow.</p>
<p>Oberwinder has sent me the prospectus of his paper<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> for subscription. It appears twice a month, and costs 45 kreuzer per quarter. If I send the list back with subscriptions, 1 copy for you, 1 copy for Moore, 1 for Borkheim and 1 for me, we shall have to send the total sum of 3 gulden. You can't send the money individually, I mean for one COPY.</p>
<p>Enclosed <i>Lanterne</i> and <i>Cloche</i> and <i>Werker.</i> Do send me copies of <i>Zukunft,</i> so that I can see something about the Reichstag.</p>
<p>And also, if possible, Manchester papers containing arguments about the price of cotton. The Liberal M.P. from Manchester<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> is supposed to be agitating or spreading agitation amongst the workers in Stockport so that they should demand, directly from the GOVERNMENT, <i>cotton production</i> in India, that is, PROTECTION IN ANOTHER FORM.</p>
<p>COMPLIMENTS to MRS Lizzie ON RESTORATION OF HEALTH. <i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Moor</p>
<p>I hope your eye inflammation has passed.

Bebel and Liebknecht accused Schweitzer of having contacts with the Bismarck Government and of attempts to prevent the formation of a united workers' party in Germany. The congress showed that Schweitzer's authority had been undermined: 14 delegates representing 4,635 of the Association's members refused to give him a vote of confidence, while 42 delegates with 7,400 votes gave such a vote. The congress adopted a number of resolutions aimed at restricting Schweitzer's dictatorial powers and making the internal life of the Association more democratic: in addition to the President, it was to be headed by a board of twelve members and its seat was to be in Hamburg. A proposal was moved to convene a Social-Democratic congress in Germany with a view to 'founding a united organisation'. On Schweitzer's suggestion, it was resolved to establish closer contacts with the International to the extent permitted by the German law. In fact, however, the Association's leadership continued to pursue a sectarian policy and obstruct the affiliation of the Association with the International.</span>

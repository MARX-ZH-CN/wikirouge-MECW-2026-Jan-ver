<br><i>To Engels in Manchester</i>
<br><b>[London,] 20 May 1865</b>
<br><b>Dear Fred</b>,
<br>Cutting <b>enclosed</b> which includes my address to Johnson.
<br>Edgar's reappearance did, of course, surprise us greatly. <b>Quite the fellow I thought him</b>, and his career quite as I expected it. <b>It is a pity</b> that he could not always have been right-hand to Garibaldi He would have suited him to a tee. But the poor devil is still very weak. He will be staying here for some time, apropos of which you could be doing <b>a good work</b> by contributing to the replenishment of my <em>wine-cellar.</em>
<br>I am working like a horse at the moment, as I must make use of the time when I am fit for work, and the carbuncles are still with me, though they only trouble me locally and do not disturb the brain-pan.
<br>In between times, since one cannot always be writing, I am doing some <b>differential calculus</b> dx/dy. I have no patience to read anything else at all. Any other kind of reading always drives me back to my writing-desk.
<br>Special meeting of the '<b>International</b>' this evening. A good old codger, an <b>old Owenist</b>, <em>Weston</em> (<b>carpenter</b>), has put up the following two propositions that he is constantly defending in <em>The Bee-Hive:</em>
<br>1. that <b>a general rate in the rise of the rate of wages</b> would be of no benefit to the workers;
<br>2. that the <b>trades unions</b> for that reason, etc., are <em>harmful.</em>
<br>If these two propositions, in which <em>he</em> alone in our <b>Society</b> believes, were to be accepted, we should be in a terrible mess, both in respect of the <b>trades unions</b> here and the <b>infection of strikes</b> now prevailing on the Continent.
<br>He will be supported in the matter by a native Englishman — since non-members are also admitted to this meeting — who has written a pamphlet to the same effect. I am, of course, expected to produce a refutation. I ought therefore really to have worked out my <em>réplique</em> for this evening, but I thought it more important to get on with writing my book, and so I shall have to rely on improvisation.
<br>I know in advance, of course, what the two main <b>points</b> will be:
<br>1. that <em>wages</em> determine the value of commodities;
<br>2. that if the capitalists pay 5s. today instead of 4, tomorrow they will sell their commodities for 5s. instead of 4 (being <b>enabled</b> to do so by the increased demand).
<br>Trite though that is, and however little it penetrates the topmost surface of things, it is, nevertheless, not easy to explain to the ignorant all the competing economic questions involved. <b>You can't compress a course of political economy into 1 hour. But we shall do our best</b>.
<br>Edgar regards it as a <b>good omen</b> that he met you first in England. He liked <b>Lizzy</b> very much.
<br><em>Salut.</em>
<br>Your<br>K. M.
<br>It is a most strange irony of fate that this Edgar, who never exploited anyone other than himself and was always a <b>workman</b> in the strictest sense of the word, went through <b>a war of</b> and <b>with starvation</b> for the slave-owners. Ditto that both brothers-in-law have for the moment been ruined by the American war.

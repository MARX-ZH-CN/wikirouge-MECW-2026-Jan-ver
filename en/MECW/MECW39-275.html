MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 16 May 1855 28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>My wife is most unwell; the household in general still very upset. From the day we left Manchester<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>the weather here has been unremittingly awful.</p>
<p>Dronke, the little fool, refuses to send you the Bruno Bauer<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>until you have sent him his 'rubbers'. The Petermann<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>got packed by mistake. Would already have been returned to you if I hadn't wanted to send it at the same time as the Bruno Bauer. Tell me how you wish it done. If you send the little fool his shoes, you might at the same time send me the Decker, which I forgot.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>I have written to Breslau.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>No answer yet. In the meantime write and tell me in greater detail how many sheets—whether in separate volumes or ALL TOGETHER—, charges, etc.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>At long last a few more <i>Tribunes</i> from Cluss, together with a couple of lines in which he indicates that he will be writing.</p>
<p>Herewith 1. <i>The Sunday Times</i> on the 'Soho scorpions'. 2. A cutting from <i>The People's Paper</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>in which you may read about Mr Jones' curious negotiations with the City reformers,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>and 'how he was brought down' (clearly the chaps wanted to have the working plebs standing <i>in</i> the street <i>outside</i> their doors as mere super- numeraries, just for SHOW and to demonstrate their movement's popularity). The business is VERY CURIOUS INDEED.</p>
<p>Regards to Lupus.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>The <i>Political Fly-Sheets</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>have now come out as a book. In the foreword Mr Tucker thanks me <i>by name</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>which, with an Aliens Bill in the offing, is NOT QUITE RECOMMENDATORY.

<li id="cite_note-6"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-6">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Engels planned to write a critique of pan-Slavist ideas. Ever since his removal to Manchester in 1850 Engels had been studying the language, literature and history of the Slav peoples. As can be judged from Marx' letters to Engels of 16 May and 26 June 1855, Marx negotiated the publication of Engels' pamphlet in Germany (see this volume, pp. 535 and 539). But these plans of Marx and Engels remained unfulfilled. In April 1855 at Marx's request Engels wrote two articles on this subject under the title 'Germany and Pan-Slavism' (see present edition, Vol. 14, pp. 156-62). They were published in the Neue Oder-Zeitung and under changed titles in the New-York Daily Tribune (see Note 649)</span>

Taking advantage of the alarm in the country caused by the plight of the British army in the Crimea, the Association hoped by means of mass rallies and with the Chartists' support to bring pressure to bear on Parliament and win broader access to government posts for members of the commercial and finance bourgeoisie. The Association failed in its strivings and soon ceased to exist. Marx repeatedly wrote about the Association's activity and its relations with the Chartists; see for instance his article 'The Agitation Outside Parliament' (present edition, Vol. 14)</span>

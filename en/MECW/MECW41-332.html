MARX TO FERDINAND FREILIGRATH
<br>IN LONDON
<br>[London,] 12 July 1864 1 Modena Villas, Maitland Park
<br>Dear Freiligrath,
<br>I got a letter today (just now) on which the address would appear to be written in your hand. If that is so, I should like to know <i>how</i> the letter reached you? It is from that blackguard Brass (in Berlin) who has the impudence to ask me to forward a scrawl to Biscamp.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Having lost sight of that vagabond Biscamp years ago, I have, moreover, no idea how to rid myself of the scrawl, since the creature's WHEREABOUTS are not known to me.
<br>I am writing from my bed, having had to take to it for several days because of what was a very dangerous carbuncle. This damned complaint keeps incessantly cropping up again.
<br>On the 15th inst. I shall send Lenchen to you bearing £30, returned with many thanks—if, that is, I am not myself capable, though I think I shall be, of betaking myself between now and the 15th (inclusive) to the City, where I have other business to attend to.
<br><i>Salut.</i>
<br>Your
<br>K. M.

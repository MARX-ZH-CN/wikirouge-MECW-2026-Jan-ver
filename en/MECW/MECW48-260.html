ENGELS TO PASQUALE MARTIGNETTI</p>
<p>IN BENEVENTO<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>London, 30 March 1890</p>
<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>Herewith the letter to Labriola you asked for.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>As to his <i>terra libera,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>it is in fact altogether too much to expect of the present Italian government that it will allocate property in the colonies to small farmers for themselves to cultivate and not to monopolists, whether companies or individuals. Small-scale farming is the natural and best system for the colonies presently being founded by bourgeois govern- ments, on which point cf Marx, <i>Capital,</i> Volume I, last chapter, 'The Modern Theory of Colonisation'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>So we socialists can, with a good conscience, support the introduction of the system of small farms into colonies that have already been founded. But whether this will be done is another question. All governments today are so much the creatures and hirelings of financiers and the stock exchange that there's nothing to stop the speculators themselves from gaining control of the colonies in order to exploit them, and no doubt that will also apply in Eritrea. But one can, after all, hit back, even if it's in the shape of a demand that the government should give the emigrant Italian farmers an assurance that they will enjoy the same advantages there as they seek and generally find in Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>I can't discover from the <i>Messaggero's</i> article<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>whether Labriola combines his demand with still further requirements, namely govern- ment loans for emigrants to Eritrea, co-operatively run settlements, etc.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have absolutely no time to spare for revising the translation of <i>Wage Labour and Capital.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>I have had some urgent jobs to do, and must now get back at once to Volume III of <i>Capital</i> before events in Germany take a revolutionary turn, as is very possible.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>F. Engels

This publication was prefaced with the following editorial text: 'Professor Labriola's proposal concerning the settlement of the colony of Eritrea is also finding support abroad. After reading the letters of Professors Labriola and Loria in II Messaggero, Frederick Engels wrote from London on 30 March to our regular contributor P. Martignetti'.</span>

It was published in Milan only in 1893.</span>

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE</p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>London, 16 November 1872</p>
<p>Dear Sorge,</p>
<p>Your letter of the 25th crossed with mine of 2 November. Marx will have written to you since then.</p>
<p>I gave a copy of the Address<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> to Serraillier in French and first of all to MacDonnel in English for the Irish. I next copied one out myself for <i>The International Herald</i> and lastly sent one to the FEDERAL COUNCIL. The fact is that I was very uncertain whether the FEDERAL COUNCIL might not suppress it or, alternatively, that they might not print it <i>word for word</i> with various mistakes in the English and strong Germanisms, so as to expose it to ridicule. I have, of course, changed the latter since the Address was, <i>as it stood,</i> quite unprintable either in English or French. We have always had such things corrected by some educated NATIVE. You will have to do the same as in official documents it is often not possible to make even grammatical alterations, and it is always fatal. For Hales and the Jurassians, etc., any mistake of that sort is in any case a source of amusement.</p>
<p>Up to now the Belgians have not printed anything. You will have to send the Address to Australia yourselves; you will have had a visit from Harcourt in the meantime; I do not have any addresses in Australia.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Jones and Le Moussu have been warned. I shall see Serraillier tomorrow and shall tell him to send you a report which, on account of <i>Dereure,</i> will have to dispense with both names and addresses—the latter he can send you <i>privatim.</i> More on Dereure below.</p>
<p>The stamps<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> cost about <i>£1</i>—Le Moussu did the design gratis. To print the Rules in English<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> cost around £12.</p>
<p>I have already told you of the formation of two new Italian sections.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> The official letter now enclosed.</p>
<p>I am sending you today: 1 <i>Emancipation</i> and the manifesto of the <i>Nueva Federation Madrilena</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>1 <i>Égalité</i> 1 <i>International Herald</i>—report of the FEDERAL COUNCIL<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> 7 <i>Résolutions du Congrès de la Haye.</i> The following matters to report in addition: 1. <i>Blanquists.</i> They have issued a pamphlet: <i>Internationale et révolution</i> of which several copies per NEXT STEAMER. They announce their resignation from the International on the grounds that with the transfer of the General Council to New York it has committed suicide. They will found their own association and are already intriguing actively in France. It is therefore absolutely essential, firstly, that Dereure should not get hold of any addresses in France, and secondly, that he should say where he stands. Of course, this second point is only urgent if you consider it desirable. Serraillier will reply to this concoction in the <i>Liberté</i> and the <i>Égalité.</i> Ranvier has told Lafargue that the first draft was so full of personalities that he declared he would never put his name to it. He had never seen the second, published, version and his name appeared under it without his authorisation. He has quarrelled with them: they have had the audacity to put him on trial because he continues to belong to a refugee club called the <i>Cercle d'Études Sociales</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> without permission, and he refused to submit to a schoolmasterly examination in the court set up by the <i>purs</i> (which is the name the Blanquists give themselves). As you can see, they are playing at <i>Commune révolutionnaire</i> in the same old way. You will be amused by their little pamphlet in which Vaillant in all seriousness presents all our economic and political ideas as Blanquist discoveries. They have already started to cause trouble<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<p>in various places in France, apart from Paris where that tall man, Walter, is their agent. Although they are not a threat, they must not be given the means to stir up even more trouble, which is why Dereure must not have any addresses and why we must keep an eye on him.</p>
<p>2. <i>Spain.</i> Matters are going splendidly here. The FEDERAL COUNCIL has had a long thing printed and circulated on the quiet.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> It contains</p>
<p>a) a report on the Congress by the 4 Spaniards which is full of lies,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> </p>
<p>b) the resolutions of the anti-authoritarians of Saint-Imier,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> </p>
<p>c) a motion from the Barcelona Federation to convoke a Spanish Congress on 25 December which would decide between the resolutions of The Hague and Saint-Imier,</p>
<p>d) a request to all local federations to give their views on this <i>by 10 November.</i></p>
<p>The <i>Nueva Federación Madrilena</i> replied to this with the manifesto being sent to you today. It objects to the submission of the Hague resolutions to any International assembly except for the purposes of consideration and implementation. (We have already sent the materials necessary to counter the lies of the 4 Spaniards to Madrid.)</p>
<p>However, in order that the Spaniards should realise <i>who</i> actually rules them, the Jura Committee has already sent the Saint-Imier resolutions direct to all local federations in Spain with the request for their views on them; they have completely by-passed the Spanish FEDERAL COUNCIL.</p>
<p>In the meantime, things have been happening in Spain. The federations of Gracia (industrial suburb of Barcelona) with 500 members, of Toledo (200 members) and those of Badalona and Denia near Barcelona, have come out in our favour and against the Spanish Congress. In Valencia a large part of the local federation is on our side, as well as part of the one in Cadiz, which has already broken away from the old federation there. The sale of the <i>Emancipación,</i> which had been moribund and kept alive by money we had sent from here, is greatly on the increase once more (150 copies in Cadiz, Valencia and Gracia alone). In Gracia there was a large general assembly on 4 November.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> The Barcelonese, with Alerini at their head, put their proposal forward, but as Mora (who is there) writes:</p>
<p>'Despite all his shouting and gesticulating with his arms and his stick, Alerini was unable to convince these atheists that the Society of Jesus<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup> had been acting well. So it was resolved to approve all the Hague resolutions and to censure the attitude of the Spanish delegates.'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Things are going well; if the worst comes to the worst we shall keep a very respectable minority in Spain which will part company with the rest and be of greater value than all the vague nonsense hitherto. However, it is quite possible that we shall smash the whole thing to pieces and throw the Alliance out. For all of this we have Mesa to thank, who has had to bear the brunt <i>all on his own.</i> Mora is feeble and at one point vacillated for a moment. Read the article 'Los medios de la Alianza', in <i>Emancipación</i> No. 71, to see how the Spanish FEDERAL COUNCIL attempted to win over Mora by INTIMIDATION.</p>
<p>3. <i>London FEDERAL COUNCIL.</i> Thanks to the slackness of the better people among the English, Hales and Mottershead have succeeded in gaining complete control of the FEDERAL COUNCIL. A mass of delegates from imaginary sections have momentarily provided Hales with a majority; he is secretary and treasurer all in one, and you can see from the report in today's <i>International Herald</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup> that he is doing as he pleases. The only thing we can do is to hold the better elements together until those crooks clash with each other, which will happen soon enough. GIVE THEM ROPE ENOUGH AND THEY WILL HANG THEMSELVES. You will now be receiving <i>The International Herald</i> regularly so that you can see for yourselves how Hales is giving himself airs and acting as if he were the GENERAL COUNCIL. As soon as an opportunity presents itself—a breach of the Rules or something of the sort—and, as an intimate and correspondent of the Jurassians, Hales will provoke one soon enough, our people will split off and form a federation of their own, perhaps one together with the Irish. Unfortunately MacDonnel is leaving for America, but even so we have a very good successor to him in De Morgan, one, moreover, who travels all over England as a LECTURER. He is completely in the picture about the situation.</p>
<p>In order to ensure here the desired publicity for your proclamations, etc., it would be good if the General Council could <i>officially</i> put me in charge of these matters for England. The FEDERAL COUNCIL undoubtedly suppresses as much as it can, and although Riley of <i>The International Herald</i> is an honest fellow and has left the FEDERAL COUNCIL in DISGUST, he is weak and somewhat dependent on the FEDERAL COUNCIL for the sale of his paper. So if I can show him a resolution to that effect he will be covered and will do everything.</p>
<p>I leave it to you to decide whether you wish to send me plenary powers for Italy.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup> In view of the struggle there, in which our people are in a tiny minority, swift intervention would be very desirable. I do indeed maintain my private correspondence with them and also write for the <i>Plebe,</i> but without plenary powers I cannot exert any influence on the sections, which, like the one in Turin, appear to be going to seed entirely and do not communicate at all, something which happens all too often in Italy.</p>
<p>Marx is on a visit to Longuet and his wife in Oxford for a few days<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" id="cite_ref-18">[18]</a></sup> so as to go through a part of the French translation of <i>Capital</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" id="cite_ref-19">[19]</a></sup> with Longuet. He will probably not be back before Monday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" id="cite_ref-20">[20]</a></sup> </p>
<p>In my opinion you should in any case delegate plenary powers for France to Serraillier.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" id="cite_ref-21">[21]</a></sup> This sort of correspondence cannot possibly be conducted from over there; only, you should require him to send you monthly reports. You will not find anyone better; Dupont is too negligent unless he is spurred on daily and we frequently do not see him here for a fortnight at a time.</p>
<p>As to the Jurassians, it is our view that the best way to proceed is simply to declare that they had disqualified themselves from membership of the International by the resolutions of <i>their</i> congress in Saint-Imier,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" id="cite_ref-22">[22]</a></sup> which contravene such-and-such articles of the Rules and Administrative Regulations, and then simply to notify the other federations of this fact. Incidentally, things are going badly for them. In Biel, where they no longer had a single member (see <i>Scissions</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23" id="cite_ref-23">[23]</a></sup> ), a new section has been formed but it has affiliated itself to <i>Geneva,</i> and their model section in Moutier (see <i>Scissions)</i> has <i>repudiated</i> the resolutions of Saint-Imier. As you see, the Hague resolutions<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24" id="cite_ref-24">[24]</a></sup> are already bearing fruit everywhere.</p>
<p>As for Germany, it would be good if Marx were to have plenary powers—just in case of emergencies with the Schweitzerians.</p>
<p>All these are matters that you must consider. I am up to my eyes in work here. The fact that Mesa has started to translate the <i>Manifesto</i> has forced me to send him a revised version of the French translation from the <i>Socialiste.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25" id="cite_ref-25">[25]</a></sup> The version you brought with you in manuscript turned out to be very useful in this, as it is much better, although still based on <i>Woodhull's</i> English.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26" id="cite_ref-26">[26]</a></sup> I am taking the opportunity this provides to put the French translation in order altogether. In addition I have articles to do for <i>Volksstaat, Emancipación</i> and <i>Plebe;</i> and as soon as Lafargue, who is now here, has found somewhere to live, we shall make a start on the <i>Alliance</i> business.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27" id="cite_ref-27">[27]</a></sup> Lucain still has a lot of papers in Brussels and now writes that he will send them <i>at the end of next week,</i> because he wants to copy them!<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28" id="cite_ref-28">[28]</a></sup> </p>

In this connection, on 1 November 1872, the New Madrid Federation issued an Address, 'La Nueva Federación madrilena á todas las federaciones, secciones é individuos de la Asociación Internacional en España', which was signed 'Victor Pages' and published in<i> La Emancipación,</i> No. 73, 9 November 1872. The authors of the Address proposed the election of a new Federal Council which would act in conformity with the International's Rules and the resolutions of its General Congresses.<br>The<i> Nueva Federación madrilena</i> (New Madrid Federation) was founded on 8 July 1872 by the members of the<i> Emancipación</i> editorial board expelled from the Madrid Federation by its anarchist majority. An important part in the foundation and work of the Federation was performed by Paul Lafargue. On 15 August 1872 the General Council recognised it as an equal member of the International (see present edition, Vol. 23, p. 215). The New Madrid Federation resolutely opposed the anarchist influence in Spain and spread the ideas of scientific socialism.</span>

The anarchist congress also adopted a special resolution rejecting political struggle on the part of the working class and denying the need to establish an independent proletarian political party.

Over 80,000 soldiers, officers and generals, Napoleon III among them, were taken prisoner. The Sedan catastrophe caused a revolution in Paris on 4 September 1870 which led to the collapse of the Second Empire and the proclamation of the republic in France.

Its decision to include in the General Rules (as Article 7a) the major tenet on the conquest of political power by the proletariat, and its resolutions relating to Administrative Regulations signified a victory for Marxism. The Congress took stock of the struggle Marx, Engels and their followers had waged for years against petty-bourgeois sectarianism in the workers' movement, in whatever guise it appeared, most notably against Bakuninism; Mikhail Bakunin and James Guillaume, the anarchist leaders, were expelled from the International. The resolutions of the Hague Congress laid the groundwork for the future formation of independent political parties of the working class on a national level.</span>

The Hague Congress decided to publish the documents pertaining to the Alliance (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 249-50). The documents were passed on to the committee appointed to prepare the Congress minutes and resolutions for publication, which included Marx and Engels among its members. In April 1873 they started work on<i> The Alliance of Socialist Democracy and the International Working Men's Association,</i> as the Congress had resolved. The bulk of the work involved in the collection of additional material, its comparison and analysis was carried out by Engels and Paul Lafargue. The concluding part of the pamphlet was written by Marx (see this volume, p. 521). The pamphlet appeared in French in late August-early September 1873 (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 454-580).

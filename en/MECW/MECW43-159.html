<p><i>To Engels in Manchester</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 24 February 1869</b></p>
<p><b>Dear Fred</b>,</p>
<p><b>Best thanks</b> for the <b>Report</b> [on the coalminers in Saxony]. It is transparently clear. I have changed nothing, except to strike out the final sentence (or rather some words of it). Yesterday read out in the Central Council. Adopted. Will be sent first to <em>The Times</em> (or rather taken there by Eccarius). If they don't take it, then to <em>The Daily News.</em> Then the English press cutting will be sent to <em>Zukunft, Social-Demokrat</em> and <em>Wilhelm.</em> The <b>poor devils</b> of Lugau will have the great satisfaction of being mentioned in the English press.</p>
<p>Enclosed <b>Resolutions</b><em>,</em> etc., 6 in all. The circumstances are as follows. The resolution of the Congress (Brussels) obliged us to have the Brussels resolutions printed. Using the excuse that the <em>Geneva</em> resolutions form part of the <b>platform</b>, we have printed, at the same time, <em>part</em> of what was tabled at the Geneva congress by the London Central Council and adopted by the Geneva congress, omitting the amendments, etc., proposed by the French in Geneva and <em>also</em> adopted — rubbishy stuff. Thus, this portion is written by me. On the other hand, I had no part in drafting the 1868 <b>Resolutions</b>. The only phrase from me verbatim is the <b>first considering 'On the effects of machinery'.</b></p>
<p>That Bakunin should lay claim to the 'Slav' brothers in Courland and Livonia is great. Neither are his <b>claims on</b> Silesia bad.</p>
<p>What about Foster, <b>Exchanges</b>?</p>
<p>Meissner is a fine fellow; I sent him, a few days <em>before</em> your visit to London, a copy of Louis <em>Bonaparte.</em> Asked for <em>immediate</em> notification. No word yet.</p>
<p>Wilhelm remains unchangeably the same. He wrote to me that he had sent 50 or 60 copies to Kugelmann, but Kugelmann in fact has received only 6 copies!</p>
<p><em>Salut.</em></p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.

MARX TO NIKOLAUS DELIUS</p>
<p>IN BONN</p>
<p>Bad Neuenahr,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> 25 August 1877<br>
Hotel Flora</p>
<p>Dear Professor Delius,</p>
<p>My daughter Eleanor, who is with me here taking the waters, had the privilege of translating into English, for the London Shakespeare Society, one of your papers on the epic element in Shakespeare, 41 and would very much like to make your acquaint- ance in person. If it would be convenient to you to name a day and time at which we might meet, I should be glad to introduce my daughter to you.</p>
<p>I am, Sir,</p>
<p>Your most obedient Servant,</p>
<p>Karl Marx</p>
<p>We shall probably be spending another 8 or 9 days here before, WIND AND WEATHER PERMITTING, moving on to the Black Forest.

<p>Letter to Marx in London</p>
<p><br>
[Manchester,] 4 October 1865</p>
<p>I always strike unlucky with my plans for coming to London. I met my mother<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>just 3 days before my return here, in Ostende, to be exact, and I couldn't make it an hour shorter, of course. Nor could I have met her any earlier, as neither of us knew where she would be 2-3 days before. But I was DUE here on 15 September,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>as Charles<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>had to leave on that day, as he in fact did. Since then, as always when I come back from a journey, the very devil has got into the cotton market, I have had to look after Charles' work as well as my own, and that is no trifle when cotton goes up in a fortnight from 18 to 24 l/2d. per pound, yarns on the other hand by 8-9d. per pound, and telegrams of every description pour in. I hope that is all over now, and besides Charles will come back at the beginning of next week, so that I can gather my wits again at last. This horrible rush has made it positively impossible for me to write even 2 lines to you, in fact, since I've been back, I've not been able to write a line of private correspondence at all. As soon as ever I can, I will write at greater length; meanwhile do let me know how you all are and how the 'book'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>is getting on. I think I should manage to come over some time for 3 X 24 hours, as soon as we have got things in order here. But our office is looking like a pigsty, Gottfried<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>has taken on 3 fellows for me who are absolutely hopeless, and is holding me to the contract which says I am to make something of them. So, you can see the way things are here. I shall have to sack one or two of them.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p>Kindest regards to all.</p>
<p>I was also 'all ready' among the Swabians; however, they are not creating any School of Poetry but are cotton-spinning, or emigrating.

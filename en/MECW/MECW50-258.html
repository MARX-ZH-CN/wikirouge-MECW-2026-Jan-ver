ENGELS TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN</p>
<p>IN HANOVER</p>
<p>[London,] 25 January 1895</p>
<p>Dear Kugelmann,</p>
<p>I cannot yet give you an indication of the compendiums, etc., in which the articles in question may be found, for 1. I shall first have to<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>know what we have already got (some being in Germany, about which I shall shortly be hearing, and some in America, which I am waiting for), aside from my own things; 2. Because I myself cannot say exactly, though all sorts of things recur to me whenever any new stuff arrives; 3. Because, as soon as No, 1 has been attended to, we must so arrange matters that neither of us competes with the other, and thus puts the price up. In the meantime it would be a good thing if you were to keep an eye open for specifically <i>Westphalian</i> literature of 1845-47: <i>Dampfboot</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>and compendiums as well as other stuff written by those people at that time.</p>
<p>I believe I <i>have</i> got Meyer's collection of <i>Tribune</i> articles here; it will be the more comprehensive of the two collections, Marx having obtained various things from over there shortly after Meyer's death.</p>
<p>Kindest regards to all,</p>
<p>Yours</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p><i>Frankfurter Zeitung</i> received with thanks.

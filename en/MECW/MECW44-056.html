ENGELS TO FREDERICK GREENWOOD
<br>IN LONDON
<br>[Draft] [London,] 17 December [1870] 1 p.m.
<br>A friend of mine Mr Oswald sends me the enclosed. He says that the usual tickets have been sent to <i>The Pall Mall Gazette</i> and wishes me to say a word in favour of Mrs Oswald's tonight's concert being noticed in that paper, or at least to induce your musical critic to go and hear her. I have told him that this is entirely out of my line and that I even do not know how to go about such a thing. However he insists, and as he is a very worthy fellow I can only say, that if you can consistently do something in that direction you will confer a personal favour upon me. I am too bad a musician to permit myself an opinion but I have heard people who ought to know, speak very highly of Mrs Oswald's play..

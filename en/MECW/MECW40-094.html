<br><i>To Engels in Ryd</i>e
<br><b>[London,] 21 September 1857 9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, Haverstock Hill</b>
<br>Dear Engels,
<br>Nothing could please me more than to hear that your health is progressing.
<br>Last Friday, a letter arrived from Dana, cool and curt. I replied that I would complain to the <b>Post Office</b> at once. Further, having '<em>Algeria</em>' and '<em>Ammunition</em>' to hand, I sent them off with the comment that I had <b>copies</b> of them; also that I had 'Army' in the original, and would send it off immediately a fresh copy had been made (I did this because in recent letters you have several times mentioned that 'Army' was almost finished); also, that '<em>Artillery</em>' would for the most part come under the <b>History of Cannon</b> and that I no longer had the manuscript. The <em>only A's now remaining</em> — and these I would send on the off-chance, although it is probably by now too late — were, all told, 'Army', 'Armada' and 'Ayacucho'. I mentioned the last 2 because you can keep them quite short, while the material I have sent you will provide some original stuff on the Armada and Ayacucho (about Espartero). That's how matters stand.
<br>Tomorrow I shall send off 3 more biographies.
<br>My circumstances won't permit me to come to Brighton, still less accompany you to Jersey.
<br>On closer examination I find that all I want from you on the generals under B is an answer to my question about Bernadotte together with the essentials concerning Blücher, Bugeaud, Bosquet (in the Crimean War). I have enough on the other Frenchmen. Finally, Sir <em>G. Brown</em>, about whom I know nothing. Not much needed on the man.
<br>I have sent Dana your B and C lists.
<br><em>Salut</em>.
<br>Your<br>K. M.

MARX TO ENGELS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 4 December 1863</p>
<p>Dear Frederick,</p>
<p>Very many thanks for the £10. Ditto, retrospectively, for the port. It has done me a power of good. Besides the wine, I have (up till now) been having to swill f/2 quarts of the strongest London STOUT every day. It struck me as a good theme for a short story. From the front, the man who regales HIS INNER MAN with port, claret, stout and a truly massive mass of meat. From the front, the guzzler. But behind, on his back, the OUTER MAN, a damned carbuncle. If the devil makes a pact with one to sustain one with consistently good fare in circumstances like these, may the devil take the devil, I say. Incidentally, I still feel light-headed and my knees are those of a broken-down hack, but I imagine the journey will put a stop to all this. Little Tussy told me apropos the OUTER MAN: 'BUT IT IS YOUR OWN FLESH!' By the by, I can't speak too highly of Dr Allen's behaviour towards me. He remarked, by the by, apropos the operation, that GERMAN PHILOSOPHERS were always self-consistent.</p>
<p>As regards the 'sea-girt',<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> by and large, I agree with you.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Obviously, the whole succession business is merely of diplomatic significance. As TO DENMARK, she is not, I think, bound by the Treaty of London<sup>38n</sup> in as much as the Danish Parliament was intimidated by Russian warships when the vote was taken. I enclose herewith Urquhart's nonsense,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> R. Schramm's nonsense,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>lastly a <i>Danish</i> pamphlet, which is of interest on at least two counts, 1. with regard to the fellows from whom the Schleswig-Holstein movement originally stemmed; 2. with regard to the stand taken by the peasants in Holstein.</p>
<p>In today's <i>Times</i> you will find under the heading 'Schleswig-Holstein' an item by Dr Thudichum that is typical of German historiography.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>I shall certainly get hold of a publisher for you in Germany. So, buckle to straight away.</p>
<p>I shall drop you a couple of lines as soon as I am in Trier. I also have to go to Holland, for my uncle<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> is my MONSTER creditor.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>But one mustn't irritate the Danes. They've got to understand that Scandinavians and Germans have a <i>common</i> interest in opposing Russia and that nothing could be more advantageous to themselves than the separation of the German element.

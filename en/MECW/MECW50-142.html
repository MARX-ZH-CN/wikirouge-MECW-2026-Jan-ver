ENGELS TO PYOTR LAVROV</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>London, 4 January 1894<br>
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>My dear Lavrov,</p>
<p>Thank you for your card—please accept my best wishes for the New Year.</p>
<p>It would seem that, despite the harmony between Carnot and the tsar,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> it will be the French, and not the outlawed Russians who will suffer persecutions and tribulations, the inevitable effect of anarcho-police bombs. So much the better. After all, there are signs that even the Parisian <i>philistine</i> would seem to be feeling just a little shame for his hysterical actions of last October.</p>
<p>Could you let me have the address of Mr. Rapoport, who has just returned to Switzerland?</p>
<p>Best regards from</p>
<p>F. Engels</p>
<p>There is finally some hope that you will receive the 3rd volume of <i>Capital</i> before the end of the year. The Russian translation will be done as for the 2nd volume. I will send the proofs to Danielson.

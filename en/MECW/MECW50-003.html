ENGELS TO HUGO LINDEMANN AND CARL STEGMANN</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>122 Regent's Park Road, N.W.,
London, 6 October 1892</p>
<p>Dear Sirs,</p>
<p>In reply to your favour of 2.X, I have in the past frequently complied with requests of a similar nature from gentlemen who were quite unknown to me, but my experience in these cases has been such that unfortunately I have had to make up my mind to discontinue the practice. 4</p>
<p>As a result of an indisposition, moreover, I expect to be tied to my sofa for a considerable time to come and hence am in no condition to go searching in my library for old, seldom used periodicals.</p>
<p>In the circumstances I regret that I cannot oblige you in the way you wish and remain,</p>
<p>Yours very truly,
F. Engels

MARX TO PYOTR LAVROV</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London, 17 December 1875]</p>
<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>Our good Leblanc is very ill and likes to be visited. <i>Definite</i> limits were set for the last sheets (i.e. the last instalment, 44th, of the French edition of <i>Capital)</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>Mr Lachâtre alleged that things had been so arranged with the printers that it would be impossible to go beyond the 44th sheet. This meant that I had to sacrifice the subject <i>index which had already been drawn up.</i> If I find a copy of it, I will send it to you.</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>K. M.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">A reference to the French edition of the first volume of <i>Capital.</i> An attempt to translate Marx's principal work into French was first made by Charles Keller, a member of the Paris Section of the International. Between October 1869 and April 1870, he translated about 400 pages which he sent to Marx for editing. After the defeat of the Paris Commune, however, Keller was forced to emigrate to Switzerland, where he embraced Bakuninist views, after which Marx terminated co-operation with him.
In December 1871, Paul Lafargue assisted Marx in concluding a contract for the publication of <i>Capital</i> with the progressive French journalist and publisher Maurice Lachâtre. The contract was signed on 15 February 1872. Under it, <i>Capital</i> was to appear in 44 instalments, one printer's sheet each. The work appeared between 1872 and 1875 in two instalments at a time, but was sold in series of five instalments each, making nine series in all.
The last instalments having come out, the series were stitched together and sold as separate books.
The first volume of <i>Capital</i> was translated into French by Joseph Roy. Marx did not think much of the effort and made a vast number of alterations, in fact, revised the book. As he himself said, the authorised French translation had an independent scientific value alongside the German original.
In this edition, the first volume of <i>Capital</i> is published in Engels' authorised English translation with the interpolations from the French edition given in the Appendix (see present edition, Vol. 35).</span>

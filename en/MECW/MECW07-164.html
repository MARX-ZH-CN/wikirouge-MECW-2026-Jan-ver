<p>Cologne, August 12. The interesting relations between our newspaper and the Public Prosecutor's office continue to take their course. Yesterday one of our editors, Ernst Dronke, was again summoned to appear before the examining magistrate as a witness.</p>
<p>There was no interrogation on oath since information had been received that, on the evening after Anneke's arrest, Dronke had visited Anneke's wife and obtained there particulars about the arrest. When the witness asked against whom the indictment was being made, an explanation of the term "Marx and consorts" was given to the effect that it was merely possible that the responsible publisher Korff would be indicted whereas they intended to indict the editor-in-chief, Karl Marx, as the supposed author of the incriminated article.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Dronke stated that he did not consider himself bound to tell the truth, since as editor it was possible he might be implicated in the authorship of the article and he would not testify against himself.

<br>Bremen, after July 27, 1839
<br>Dear Fritz,
<br><em>Recepi litteras tuas hodie, et</em> jamque tibi respomurus sum. [I received your letter today, and I am already about to answer you.] I cannot write very much to you — you are still in my debt, and I am expecting a long letter from you. Is your brother Wilhelm on holiday too? Is Wurm now studying with you in Bonn? God bless fat Peter [Jonghaus] in his <em>studia militaria</em>. A little poem written on July 27 [the anniversary of the July 1830 revolution in France] may give you practice in liberalism and in reading ancient metre. Otherwise there is nothing in it.

<h4 class="mw-headline" id="German_July_Days_1839">German July Days 1839</h4>
<br>How the waves mount up in the roaring gale, how the storm comes relentlessly onwardst
<br>Tall as a man are the foaming waves, and the skiff goes rising and falling;
<br>From the Rhine there blows a whirling wind that musters the clouds in the heavens,
<br>That splits up oaks and whips up dust and lashes the waves in its fury.
<br>Of you I think in my tossing skiff, you German kings and you princes.
<br>How the patient people bore on their heads the gilded throne you ascended,
<br>In triumph carried you through the land and sent the bold conqueror fleeing. [allusion to Napoleon I]
<br>Brazenly arrogant then you became, you betrayed all the promises given.
<br>Now a storm blows up out of France, and the people rise up in their masses,
<br>And your throne is rocked like the skiff in the storm and your hand loses hold of the sceptre.
<br>You above all, Ernst August, I challenge with angry defiance.
<br>Despotic and reckless, you flouted the law-now hark to the storm as it rises!
<br>The people look up with piercing eyes and the sword barely rests in the scabbard.
<br>Speak! Are you safe on your golden throne, as I in my boat on the waters?
<br><br>
The business about the high waves on the Weser is quite true, also that I was sailing on it on the great day of the July revolution.
<br>Give my regards to Wurm and tell him that he must write me a lot.
<br>Yours,
<br><em>Friedr. Engels</em>

<p>I hereby make it known that I have taken steps preparatory to instituting legal proceedings for libel against the Berlin <i>National-Zeitung</i> in connection with the leading articles in Nos. 37 and 41 regarding Vogt's pamphlet <i>Mein Prozess gegen die Allgemeine Zeitung</i>. I reserve the right to answer Vogt in writing at a later date since this requires putting a number of questions to people not at present in Europe.</p>
<p>For the moment then I shall say only this:</p>
<p>1. To judge by the anthology in the <i>National-Zeitung</i> — strangely the book itself has up to now been unobtainable in London either from booksellers or the acquaintances to whom Herr Vogt had earlier sent his so-called <i>Studien</i> — Vogt's concoction is merely the elaboration of a sketch that he published nine months ago in his private <i>Moniteur</i>, the Biel <i>Handels-Courier</i>. At the time I had his lampoon published in London without comment. Such a simple procedure was sufficient here, where the situations and personalities are well known, to. provide a judgment on the Herr Professor.</p>
<p>2. The <i>pretext</i> which led Herr Vogt to launch his campaign against me, like the pretext for the Italian campaign, was an "idea". I was alleged to be the author of the anonymous pamphlet <i>Zur Warnung</i>. From the enclosed circular' in English, which I have had published here, you will see that I have taken steps to compel Herr Blind and consorts either to concede the falseness of that pretext by their silence, or to be convicted of it by an English court.</p>

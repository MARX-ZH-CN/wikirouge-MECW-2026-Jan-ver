ENGELS TO PASQUALE MARTIGNETTI</p>
<p>IN BENEVENTO</p>
<p>London, 20 June 1887</p>
<p>My Dear Friend Martignetti,</p>
<p>Mr Paul's silence is due to the fact that he is on his travels just now,<sup>1</sup> as I learn from Wedde, so it would be no good inquiring at present whether he has received your photograph, but I shall probably have a chance of finding this out shortly and hope that you may meanwhile hear from him direct. Kindest regards,</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F. Engels

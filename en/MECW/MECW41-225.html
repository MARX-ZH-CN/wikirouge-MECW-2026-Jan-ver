MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 5 July [1862]</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Best thanks for the £10 of which <i>pars</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I arrived today. I hear that Mr Gumpert was down here; didn't come to see me.</p>
<p>WELL, I SHALL TRY TO DO WITHOUT HIM.</p>
<p>Herewith 1 <i>Press</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and two very clever 'talks' by Lassalle.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The enclosed letter from Lassalle was brought me by the Austrian 'Captain (retd.)' Schweigen, a worthy, stupid fellow. The joke is that Rüstow—with the added support of 2 Rüstow brothers—has proposed or is proposing so to use the National Association,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> the Gymnastic Association, etc., as to have, at the crucial moment—in the smaller German states, at least—a ready-made <i>militia commanded by Mr Rüstow</i> to pit against the army. It's a damn silly plan. And, on top of that, the money for it is to come from London! I don't believe Lassalle shares these DELUSIONS. All he wants is to make himself seem important in the eyes of Schweigert, etc.</p>
<p>I hope that you, at any rate, will come to London IN THE COURSE OF THE SEASON. Little Jenny is no longer unwell, but has grown more delicate than her constitution warrants. Whatever happens, by the by, we must manage to arrange sea-bathing for her.</p>
<p>Is Lupus in Germany by now?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>What is the position with regard to the 'ASSOCIATES' of the BRITISH ASSOCIATION?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> Are the old cards still valid? Lupus has got mine.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

The <i>British Association for the Advancement of Science</i> was founded in 1831 and still exists. It meets annually and publishes reports on these meetings. The Association's 31st annual meeting was held in Manchester between 4 and 11 September 1861. Marx, who was staying with Engels in Manchester at the time, attended the sittings of the Economic Science and Statistics Section.</span>

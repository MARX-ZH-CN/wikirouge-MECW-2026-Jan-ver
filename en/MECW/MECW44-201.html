MARX TO LAURA LAFARGUE</p>
<p>IN MADRID</p>
<p>[London,] 28 February 1872</p>
<p>My dear child,</p>
<p>You may judge of the overwork—I am being bothered with ever since December last—from my negligence in replying to your own and Paul's letters. Still my heart was always with you. In fact, the health of poor little Schnappy<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>occupies my thoughts more than everything, else, and I feel even a little angry at Paul's last epistle, full of interesting details as to the 'movement', but a mere blank in regard to that dear little sufferer.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In consequence of uninterrupted reading and writing, an inflammation of my right eye has set in since a few days, so that it forsakes service for the moment and obliges me to limit even this letter to the most necessary matter-of-fact communications.</p>
<p>In the first instance, Keller is <i>not</i> the translator of my book.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>When, at last, I had found out his whereabouts, I wrote at once.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>In his reply, he told me that he had till then only translated about 200 pages, and that, moreover, he could not proceed with the work before the month of May, being bound by contract to finish the translation of a medical work. This would not do for me. I have found in Roy, the translator of Feuerbach, a man perfectly suitable to my purpose. Since the end of December, he has received from me the corrected manuscript of the Second German edition<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>up to <i>pagina</i> 280. To-day I have written him to send at once to Paris what manuscript may be ready.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>As to the biography, I have not yet made up my mind as to whether it be at all opportune to publish it in connection with this work.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>As to the preface for Proudhon,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup><i>j'y penserait</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The printings Paul wants I shall send to-morrow<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>and should have done so before, if I had found the time to look after some statistical facts in 'the 18. Brumaire' which, I apprehend, are not quite correct.</p>
<p>To Liebknecht I shall write.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>As to Lara, making him—a man who is a perfect stranger to our party—a contributor to our party prints, is quite out of the question.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup>At the same time, you ought not to neglect all relations with his family. Under certain circumstances they might prove useful.</p>
<p>I regret that you have written to Woodhull et C°. They are humbugs that compromise us. Let Paul write to Charles A. Dana, editor of <i>The Sun</i> (New York) and offer him Spanish correspondence, and ask him at the same time (such things must be settled beforehand with the Yankees) as to the money terms. I enclose a few lines to Dana.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup>If he should not accept, I shall find another paper at New York. <i>(The Herald</i> or something else).</p>
<p>The <i>New Social Demokrat</i> is the continuation of Schweitzer's paper<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup>under another editorship. He observed still a certain decorum. It is now a mere police paper, Bismarck's paper for the Lassalleans, as he has his feudal, his liberal, his all sort of colour papers.</p>
<p><i>Apropos.</i> Misled by one of your letters I had put in the contract with Lachâtre<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup>'<i>somme de</i>... <i>sera remise à Paris</i>... <i>quinze jours après demande</i>}<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup>I shall write him to-morrow, that I prefer the payment on 1st July. In case of need, I can find the money, but I must be informed beforehand.</p>
<p>And now, my dear child, <i>adio,</i> with thousand kisses for little Schnappy and yourself, and my greetings to Paul.</p>
<p>Yours most devotedly</p>
<p>Old Nick<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>The 'Circular' against the dissentients'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" id="cite_ref-18">[18]</a></sup>you will receive as soon as printed.

However, its contents and Marx's correspondence on the subject indicate that it was addressed to the heads of the Lachâtre publishing house in Paris. On 13 February 1872 Marx received a reply from the manager Juste Vernouillet, who informed him about the despatch of copies of the agreement on the publication of the French translation of Volume I of<i> Capital.</i> The agreement was signed on 15 February by Marx on one side, and Maurice Lachâtre and Juste Vernouillet on the other. It stipulated that the French edition was to be published in 44 instalments, and sold five instalments at a time.<br>The French authorised edition of Volume I of<i> Capital</i> was published between 17 September 1872 and November 1875. The translation was done by Joseph Roy, who began in February 1872 and completed work in late 1873. The quality of the translation largely failed to satisfy Marx; besides, he was convinced that the original needed to be revised to adapt it to French readers.</span>

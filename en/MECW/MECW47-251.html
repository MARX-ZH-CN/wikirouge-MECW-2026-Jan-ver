ENGELS TO VERA ZASULICH</p>
<p>IN GENEVA</p>
<p>London, 31 March 1886</p>
<p>Dear Citizen,</p>
<p>Many thanks for sending me the translation of <i>The Poverty of Philosophy,</i> which has been safely received.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>When opening the parcel I tore the part showing the sender's address. After a good deal of trouble I managed to reassemble the pieces well enough to decipher the address I am using today. But since I don't know whether I have read it correctly, I would ask you to advise me of your address once again, as I should like to send you a copy of the Russian translation of Volume II of <i>Capital,</i> which has arrived from St Petersburg.</p>
<p>Please accept my apologies for the inconvenience caused by my clumsiness.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>F. Engels

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">In her letter of 2 March 1884, Vera Zasulich, writing on behalf of the Russian revolutionary émigrés in Switzerland, requested permission from Engels to put out a Russian edition of Marx's<i> The Poverty of Philosophy</i> (see present edition, Vol. 6). She also asked Engels to send her the text of the preface which he intended to write for the first German edition then in preparation (see Note 118) and expressed the hope that he would look through the proofs of the Russian edition and, if need be, make his remarks. The Russian edition of<i> The Poverty of Philosophy</i> appeared in Geneva in 1886 in the fifth issue of the Library of Contemporary Socialism series.</span>

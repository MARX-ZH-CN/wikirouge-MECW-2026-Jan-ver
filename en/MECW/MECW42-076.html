<p><i>To Marx in London</i></p>
<p>[Manchester,] 16 April 1865</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>The <i>Nordsterns</i> returned enclosed. Herwegh and Rustow have certainly acquired a funny Dido dog in Reusche. The fellow is a real comic turn with his solemn declarations. The inevitable oath beside Lassalle's dead body makes a precious counterpart to Willich's apple-tree. It's a real blessing that these people live so far away and that they still show a certain reserve in their attempts to approach us.</p>
<p>I haven't received No. 43 of the <i>Social-Demokrat so</i> let me have it some time if there's anything particular in it.</p>
<p>Your<br>F. E.</p>
<p>What do you say about Richmond? I had expected that Lee would act like a <i>soldier</i> and surrender, instead of taking to his heels, at least so as to secure better terms for the army. But it's better the way it is. He has ended like a scoundrel, and the tragedy closes on a comic note.

<br><i>To Marx in London</i>
<br>[Manchester,] 16 April 1865
<br>Dear Moor,
<br>The <em>Nordsterns</em> returned enclosed. Herwegh and Rustow have certainly acquired a funny Dido dog in Reusche. The fellow is a real comic turn with his solemn declarations. The inevitable oath beside Lassalle's dead body makes a precious counterpart to Willich's apple-tree. It's a real blessing that these people live so far away and that they still show a certain reserve in their attempts to approach us.
<br>I haven't received No. 43 of the <em>Social-Demokrat so</em> let me have it some time if there's anything particular in it.
<br>Your<br>F. E.
<br>What do you say about Richmond? I had expected that Lee would act like a <em>soldier</em> and surrender, instead of taking to his heels, at least so as to secure better terms for the army. But it's better the way it is. He has ended like a scoundrel, and the tragedy closes on a comic note.

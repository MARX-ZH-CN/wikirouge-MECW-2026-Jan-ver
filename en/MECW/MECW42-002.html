<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>I was glad to receive further signs of life from the workers of the Rhine Province, as conveyed in your letter of 28 September.</p>
<p><i>B. Becker or M. Hess?</i> I know them both; both are old members of the movement. Both are honest. Neither of them is capable of leading a movement of any import. Becker is a weak man, in fact, and Hess a muddle-head. It is therefore difficult to decide between the two. I also think it scarcely signifies which of the two you elect, as there will be no difficulty in finding the right people at the decisive moment.</p>
<p>Enquiries have reached me, e.g. from Berlin, as to whether I would accept the presidency? I replied that it was <i>impossible,</i> because for the present I am still forbidden to take up residence in Prussia. [in any case, if I were to assume the leadership, the government would immediately suppress the whole thing] However, I would certainly think it a <i>good gesture by the party</i>, vis-à-vis both the Prussian government and the bourgeoisie, if the workers' congress were to <i>elect</i> me, to which I would make a public reply explaining why I <i>cannot</i> accept the election. Such a step would be important for the following reason in particular: a big public <b>meeting</b> of workers took place here in London on 28 September, with English, German, French and Italian workers participating. The Parisian workers had, moreover, sent over a special delegation, headed by Tolain, a worker, who was put up as a candidate by the working class in Paris in the last elections for the Corps législatif.</p>
<p>At this <b>meeting</b>, a Comité was elected — an <i>international Comité</i> to represent the workers' interests, which is directly linked to the workers in Paris and includes the leaders of the London workers. I was elected as representative of the German workers (and my old friend Eccarius, the tailor, along with me). [to establish a liaison between the German workers' movement and the English one] If I were thus nominated by the German congress — although I would have to <i>decline</i> the election now — the <i>Comité</i> and with it the workers in London and Paris would regard this as a gesture on the part of the German workers. Next year, the <i>Comité</i> will be calling an <i>international workers' congress</i> in Brussels. Unfortunately, I shall not be able to attend in person, as I am still exiled from the model state of Belgium, just as I am from France and Germany.</p>
<p>I shall send you some '<i>Manifestoes'</i> at the first <i>safe</i> opportunity.</p>
<p>This letter will be brought to you by one of my friends from Barmen.</p>
<p>I have been sick throughout the past year (being afflicted with carbuncles and furuncles). Had it not been for that, my work on <i>political</i> economy, '<i>Capital',</i> would already have come out. I hope I may now complete it finally in a couple of months and deal the bourgeoisie a theoretical blow from which it will never recover.</p>
<p>Farewell; you may count on my remaining ever a loyal champion of the working class.</p>
<p>Yours<br>K. M.

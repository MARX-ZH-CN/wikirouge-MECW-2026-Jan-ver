<p>To Laura Lafargue in London<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hanover, 25 September 1869</p>
<p><br>
My dear Cacadou,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>I regret that I cannot celebrate at home the birthday of my dear clear bird's eye, but Old Nick's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> thoughts are with you.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Du bist beslôzen</p>
<p>In minem Herzen.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was happy to see from Möhmchen's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> letter (written in her usual amusing way, she is a real virtuoso in letter-writing) that your health is improving. Our dear little Schnappy,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> I hope, will soon get better. At the same time, I fully share Kugelmann's opinion that Dr West ought to be consulted at once (or another medical man if he be absent). I trust you and Lafargue will in this case yield to my paternal authority, a thing, you know full well, I am not in the habit of appealing to. Nobody is more difficult to treat than a baby. In no case more immediate action is wanted, and any delay more hurtful. You must under no circumstances accelerate your departure from London. It would be really dangerous to the child and do no good to yourself. On this point, every medical man will give you the same advice.</p>
<p>I am glad the Basle Congress<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> is over, and has, comparatively speaking, passed off so well. I am always fretting on such occasions of public exhibition of the party "mit allen ihren Geschwüren".<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> None of the actors was à la hauteur des principes,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> but the higher class idiocy effaces the working class blunders. We have passed through no little German town the Winkelblatt<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> of which was not full of the doings of "that formidable Congress".</p>
<p>We are here in a sort of fix. The Kugelmanns will not hear of an early leave-taking. At the same time, Jenny is much improving in health consequent upon the change of air and circumstances. With Liebknecht I am likely to meet, within a few days, at Brunswick. I decline going to Leipzig, and he cannot come to Hanover, since the Prussians would probably give him the advantages of free lodging during the present prorogation of the Reichstag.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>My best thanks to Paul for his elaborate letter.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> Meine herzlichsten Grüsse an das ganze Haus und<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup> hundred kisses to yourself and my dear little Schnappy.</p>
<p>Adio, my dear child!</p>
<p><br>
Ever yours</p>
<p>Old Nick.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup> </p>

It was attended by 78 delegates from England, France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Austria, Italy, Spain and North America. Marx was not present at the Congress but took an active part in preparing it. The General Council Minutes include his speeches dealing with individual items on the Congress's agenda: the agrarian question (6 July), the right of inheritance (20 July) and public education (10 and 17 August) (see present edition, Vol. 21).<br>The question of the right of inheritance was entered on the agenda, which was approved on 22 June 1869, at the suggestion of the Geneva Section headed by the Bakuninists. They proposed to annihilate the right of inheritance, believing this to be the only means of eliminating private property and social injustice.<br>At the General Council meeting of 3 August, Marx read out a report of the General Council on the right of inheritance, prepared by him, which was approved and submitted to the Congress on behalf of the Council. However, at the Congress itself the question of the right of inheritance provoked a heated debate. Despite the opposition of Liebknecht and De Paepe, Bakunin managed to win some of the delegates over to his side; nevertheless, thanks to the resolute stand taken by the members of the General Council and the majority of delegates who supported them, the Congress recognised the right of society to abolish the right of inheritance on condition that the Federal Council and the Congress approved.</span>

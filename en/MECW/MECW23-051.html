<blockquote>
<br>Engels drafted this rough letter (first published, in Russian, in 1935) on the margins of the letter from the Committee for the Emancipation of the Working Classes in Parma of July 7, 1872, addressed to the General Council; the document bears a note in Engels' hand: "Received 16 Juli. Beantwortet 18 Juli." (Received July 16. Answered July 18.) The fair copy of the letter was found in Parma and first published, in the language of the original, in La corrispondenza di Marx e Engels con italiani, 1848-1895, Milan, 1964.

<br>INTERNATIONAL WORKING MENS ASSOCIATION 
<br>33, Rathbone Place, London
<br>July 18, 1872
<br>Dear Citizen,
<br>From your kind letter dated June 7 (postmarked Parma, July 9 and delivered here on July 13), I conclude that your Society wishes to become affiliated to the great International Working Men's Association.
<br>As your rules<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> do not contain anything contrary to the General Rules and Regulations of the Association, there is no obstacle to your affiliation. It will only be necessary for you to adhere to the General Rules and Regulations of the Association, of which I enclose a copy in French (there being no complete and authentic edition in Italian).
<br>I should be grateful if you would discuss this proposal and let me know the outcome if affirmative so that I may complete the necessary formalities for your affiliation.
<br>Fraternal greetings.
<br>In the name of the General Council
<br>Secretary for Italy,
<br>Frederick Engels
<br>Write to the address I sent you last time, i.e. that of my place, so that your letter reaches me sooner.

ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN</p>
<p>IN ZURICH</p>
<p>London, 28 April 1883</p>
<p>Dear Bernstein,</p>
<p>(I think we should discard the boring 'Mr'.) The continuation of what follows will contain some correspondence, i. a. with Americans over Most.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is unforgivable that you are not returning via London,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>I had quite counted on it. Well, perhaps you'll come in summer and we'll take a swim in the sea together. You can always be sure of a bed at my home.</p>
<p>Mayall, the leading London photographer always to work for Marx, has the principle: WE DO NOT TAKE MONEY FROM EMINENT PEOPLE. So we can't now press the man for copies (he is extremely muddled), except by a roundabout route. Hence we have given him an order, (£12 = M240 = 24d. each) and 200 CABINET PORTRAITS (3/4 figure) <i>à £8</i> = M160 = 80d. each. It is the last and best picture to depict Moor at his sprightly Olympian ease, confident of victory. I am offering them to you, and to Liebknecht and Sorge in New York after deducting those we need ourselves. How many do you want? You don't have to sell them all at once. They will be better in any case than any made there.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F.E.

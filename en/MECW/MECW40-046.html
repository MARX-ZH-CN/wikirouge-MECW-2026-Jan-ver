MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 6 February 1857</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>An ACKNOWLEDGMENT, in great haste, of the pounds that arrived today.</p>
<p>Enclosed a letter from Miquel. I wrote to him at once. The situation as regards the <i>Tribune</i> is as I foresaw. Once again not a word. So today I wrote the fellows a forthright letter as I had originally intended but did <i>not</i> tell them that meanwhile—until their answer arrives—I shall discontinue my articles entirely.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

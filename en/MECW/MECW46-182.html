ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN VEVEY</p>
<p>London, 18 September 1882</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Your<sup>c</sup> and Laura's letter arrived at 9 o'clock in the evening; I at once went to impart what was necessary to Tussy and Lenchen.</p>
<p>We over here were also exceedingly perturbed by the false news of Bebel's death. 3 8 6 Since Saturday night there had been many indica- tions that it was false, and in the <i>Justice,</i> just received, there's a tele- gram from Liebknecht saying that, while Bebel had been dangerously ill, he was now on the mend.</p>
<p>At the same time I turned up most opportunely, the news having just been received that Jenny had had a baby girl 3 6 5 and that every- thing was going as well as could be expected.</p>
<p>When you go away from Vevey, leave an address (poste restante or something of the sort) for letters. Will write at greater length tomor- row or the day after.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p>Love to Laura.

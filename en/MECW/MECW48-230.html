ENGELS TO J. H. JOHNSON, J. JOHNSON AND G. B. ELLIS</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London, 15 November 1889] [Draft]</p>
<p>Dear Sirs,</p>
<p>I have received and considered your letter of the 7th inst.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> It strikes me as rather peculiar that you expect me to treat your enquiries as 'confi- dential', but never offer to extend the same treatment to my reply. Of course I cannot undertake such one-sided engagements.</p>
<p>If I understand you rightly, I am to report to you and eventually name the author of any reports I may have heard on board, from passengers, officers, or sailors, as far as they may have been disrespectful towards the circulating pumps of the <i>City of New York.</i> Such communications, if any, could only be made to me in the expectation that I would treat them after the manner of gentlemen, and not bring their authors into difficul- ties even supposed they had used an unguarded word or two. To act otherwise, would in my opinion be to turn common informer. Unless I misinterpret what seems to me the clear meaning of your proposal, that is what it amounts to; and in that case it is of a <i>naivete</i> equalled only by its refreshing coolness.</p>
<p>Anyhow, to set your minds at rest, I will tell you that I don't recol- lect that anybody in my presence, cast the slightest slur upon the immac- ulate circulating pumps which you have the honour to represent and that I neither know nor care who made them.</p>
<p>I will not condescend to ask you to treat this letter as confidential. A perusal of this correspondence by a Continental or American lawyer or man of business might lead to some valuable hints as to the manner of conducting similar enquiries.

ENGELS TO BRUNO SCHOENLANK
<br>IN NUREMBERG
<br>Eastbourne, 29 August 1887
<br>Dear Mr Schoenlank,
<br>Your letter, forwarded to me here by Kautsky, places me in something of a quandary. I read with interest the excerpts, published in the <i>Neue Zeit,</i> from your valuable work on the looking-glass industry and would not object on principle to your doing me the honour of dedicating the book to me.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> But, in the first place, dedications are now rather out of fashion and, in the second, Marx and I have always felt a certain aversion to such more or less uncalled-for-tributes. And at present I happen to be in a frame of mind which makes me think my merits grossly overrated in some quarters. If one is so fortunate as to collaborate for forty years with a greater man and measure oneself against him day by day, one is given the chance of evaluating one's own achievements in accordance with a true standard. And I feel instinctively that to place any undue emphasis on my own activities is unwittingly to detract from what we all of us owe to Marx.
<br>Nor can I agree with you when you dub me the father of descriptive economics. You will find descriptive economics in Petty, Boisguillebert, Vauban, and Adam Smith, to name only a few. Such accounts, notably of proletarian conditions, were written by Frenchmen and Englishmen before I did mine. It was just that I was lucky enough to be precipitated into the heart of modern large-scale industry and to be the first whose eyes were opened to its implications—at any rate the most immediate ones.
<br>So from a <i>personal</i> point of view, I would sooner you abandoned your intention, and this <i>solely</i> on the grounds outlined above. But should you fail to be convinced by them, I would not venture to dictate what you should do.
<br>Yours very faithfully,<br>
Fr. Engels

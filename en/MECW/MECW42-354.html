<p><i>To Johann Philipp Becker in Geneva</i>

<h4 class="mw-headline" id="ME42-354-2">London, [5 October 1867 1 Modena Villas, Maitland Park</h4><a id="London,_[5_October_1867_1_Modena_Villas,_Maitland_Park"></a>
<p>My dear Mr Becker,</p>
<p>I hope you have received my letter. You will doubtless be surprised at seeing a second one following so close behind the first. My husband would like Bakunin's address, and I am quite sure that you will be able to get hold of it easily in Geneva, perhaps via Herzen. He would very much like to send him his book [Capital] and write on other matters. Warmest greetings from us all and especially from</p>
<p>Yours<br>Jenny Marx

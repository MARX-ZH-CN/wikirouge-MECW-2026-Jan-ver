MARX TO FRANZ DUNCKER</p>
<p>IN BERLIN</p>
<p>London, 28 May 1859</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>You have not thought fit to reply to the letter in which I requested you to advise me of the price of the book.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>Since the American mail leaves only twice a week, I have thus been prevented from replying to my friends.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>After your receipt of my manuscript a fortnight elapsed before I got any acknowledgment. In it you said that printing was to commence a week later. That week turned into more than three weeks. About eight weeks ago Lassalle wrote to say that the thing would be finished by the middle of May. More than three weeks ago I received the last three proof-sheets. The amendments that were called for could easily have been made in a <i>single</i> day. Instead, work would again seem to have been completely suspended during that time, although printing was <i>complete.</i> I hereby declare that I am tired of this <i>systematic and deliberate procrastination</i> and that I hereby demand, and indeed categorically, that you desist from these machinations, the purpose of which seems to me exceedingly suspect. All my acquaintances in England are of the same opinion and have earnestly enjoined me to take the above step.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>Dr K. Marx

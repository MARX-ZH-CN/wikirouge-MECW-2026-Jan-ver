ENGELS TO THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF A FRENCH SOCIALIST</p>
<p>NEWSPAPER<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>[Draft]</i></p>
<p>London, 24 April 1894 122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear citizen,</p>
<p>I have received your letter dated 20<sup>th</sup> of this month, but unfortunately I am quite unable to provide an article for the 1<sup>st</sup> May issue of your newspaper.</p>
<p>To begin with, I am unwell at the moment. However, even if I were in the best of health, the urgent work that I am presently engaged in (the publication of the 3<sup>rd</sup> volume of <i>Capital</i> by Marx) and that I cannot lay aside makes it impossible for me to undertake any other literary work. I have already warned those of our friends with whom I corresponded, and asked them to excuse me. You can well understand that I cannot now do for you that which I have officially refused to do for our friends in Spain, Austria and other countries.</p>
<p>I wish your newspaper every success, and send my fraternal greetings to the editorial committee.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>F.E.

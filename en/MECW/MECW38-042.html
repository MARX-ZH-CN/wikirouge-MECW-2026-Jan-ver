<p><i>To Georg Herwegh in Paris</i></p>
<p>Dear Herwegh,</p>
<p>Engels has just arrived here for a few weeks from Paris,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> whence he has brought the following anecdote; I should be glad if you would elucidate it at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>Bernays told Ewerbeck: Herwegh came to see me and said that Marx had welcomed him in such a friendly manner that he seemed <i>to want something</i> of him. Bernays then gave Ewerbeck his unqualified permission to pass on this <i>bon mot.</i></p>
<p>I would not, of course, put pen to paper on account of this piece of gossip had it not achieved a kind of notoriety among my acquaintances in Paris.</p>
<p>I would therefore request you to tell me categorically by return whether or not there is any truth in this.</p>
<p>Your<br>Marx

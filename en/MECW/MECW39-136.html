MARX TO GUSTAV ZERFFI</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>London, 28 December 1852 28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>Sincerest thanks for your letter. There were two circumstances which enabled Bangya to hoodwink me for so long. <i>Firstly</i>, his acquaintanceship with Szemere, whom I instantly recognised as <i>l'esprit fort</i> of Hungary from his manuscript on Görgey, Kossuth, etc.,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>also, your friendship with Bangya, since you inspired me with complete confidence, despite the fact that we have known each other for so short a time. <i>Secondly</i>. So long as I was able, I attributed the inconsistencies, lies, etc., to Bangya's urge, which manifests itself at the slightest occasion, to shroud his activities in mystery and play at hide-and-seek not only with others but actually with himself.</p>
<p>At this very moment I am still inclined to believe that he is not a true spy; rather, as you rightly say, his function as <i>intermediary</i> between the various parties and as political match-maker has led him into dubious ways.</p>
<p>But first a point that is of particular concern to yourself. Szirmay is certainly an agent of Kossuth's. His mission, or so I have gathered from some unguarded remarks, is to establish contact with Bonaparte through Mr de Maupas. A short time previously Kossuth had tried to raise a loan of 1 V2 million from the Orleanists through the agency of Bangya and Malingre, his correspondent in Paris, but had met with a rebuff.</p>
<p>To return to Bangya. I have with my own eyes seen a <i>commission</i> made out by Kossuth and countersigned by Szirmay, by which Bangya is appointed prefect of police <i>in partibus</i>, as it were, by Kossuth—as chief of an anti-government counterpolice force. On the one hand, my fears over otherwise suspect contacts and acquaintanceships of Bangya's were allayed by this commission, for it gave them an air of being official connections which, if exploited with skill, could be of use to our party; thus I myself have obtained from him some details of importance concerning the Prussian government. On the other hand, I asked him outright: 'How can you reconcile your relationship with Kossuth and your relationship with Szemere?' He replied very candidly that firstly he was acting in Szemere's interest, and then the latter had <i>authorised</i> his relationship with Kossuth. I therefore never again alluded to the subject.</p>
<p>Bangya several times invited me on Kossuth's behalf to visit the latter. I replied that I lived at such and such a place and that, if Mr Kossuth wished to speak to me, he need only take the trouble of coming to see me. Kossuth then suggested that we should meet on neutral ground.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>I left the matter pending. In the meantime, however, an article of mine appeared anonymously in the <i>Tribune</i> (New York), in which I attacked Kossuth, Mazzini, etc., with especial reference to the intrigues in Paris conducted through Kiss, etc.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>Frightful hullabaloo in the American Press! Kossuth</p>
<p>contacting the tyrant! IMPOSSIBLE! Bangya, questioned by Szirmay, named me as the author, whereupon I personally told Mr Szirmay, that <i>I</i> was indeed the author. Also that, so far as I was aware, I was at complete liberty to write anything I chose about and against Mr Kossuth. Shortly afterwards I received from America newspapers in which Kossuth had had me denounced 'as a calumniator' by a supposed 'private secretary' of <i>Monsieur le Gouverneur</i>. I then, via Bangya, requested Mr Kossuth to state whether this démenti had originated with him, in which case I would chastise him with scorpions, whereas hitherto I had merely touched him with a rod.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Kossuth replied, through Szirmay, 1. that he knew nothing about the statement, 2. that he had no private secretary, and repeated his invitation, which I ignored, to meet him on neutral ground. I, for my part, published in the <i>Tribune</i> Kossuth's statement to me,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>and there, for the time being, the matter rests, although the entire inept and insipid German-American press is still buzzing with it. Nevertheless, the storm of indignation evoked by his article against me shows that Kossuth will be <i>perdu</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>the moment the fact of his alliance with Bonaparte is established.</p>
<p>I am now wholly of the opinion that we should both of us observe the <i>utmost discretion</i> for, as soon as Bangya knows that we have seen through him, he could do you and Szemere harm, perhaps considerable harm, particularly as regards your remaining in Paris. Moreover, were Bangya to be in any way publicly unmasked <i>before</i> the manuscript<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>appears, it could at best only make me look ridiculous. Finally, I believe it is important—until the point has been reached at which we can publicly unmask him—that a close watch be kept on Mr Bangya. This is particularly important while he remains in Paris. He is astounding- ly indiscreet and, if only to retain your confidence, will keep you and Szemere informed of every move made by the various parties he serves.</p>
<p>My attitude towards him, therefore, will be cool and reserved— as he can only expect after his latest coup—but I shall not let him know either the full extent of my suspicion or that I am 'secretly' corresponding with you.</p>
<p>Bangya himself, in the note enclosed in his anonymous friend's letter, writes:</p>
<p>'I think you are now at liberty to have the work published elsewhere.'</p>
<p>In giving this advice, which, by the by, is merely the echo of a threat I made him,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>he is, I think, trying to cover his rear.</p>
<p>However, I fully agree with Szemere and yourself that it is high time this was done. The only difficulty lies in the execution. A pamphlet of mine, <i>Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne</i> has just been brought out by a Swiss bookseller.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>(I shall arrange for 2 copies to be sent to you and Szemere as soon as possible.) This same bookseller is busy with an edition of my <i>18th Brumaire</i> for Germany.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>There is no prospect of inducing him to embark on a third undertaking. No bookseller in Germany now dares to publish anything of mine. Hence my only recourse would be to print it <i>at my own expense</i>, which, in my present circumstances, is impossible. And yet the thing is <i>vital</i>. I shall consider what can be done.</p>
<p>You will see from the <i>Revelations</i> that Greif is a thoroughly infamous creature. In December 1851 he visited Paris <i>in connection with the Franco-German plot</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup>and in order to establish a <i>spurious connection</i> between my friends in Cologne and the idiots in Paris.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, it is true that, while Greif was still here in London, Bangya received <i>money from Berlin</i> regularly on the 3rd or 4th of each month. Do you know from what sources he is drawing this money?</p>
<p>Our watchword in this business should be: <i>à Corsaire Corsaire et demi</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup>Should Bangya show signs of becoming 'dangerous', all we have to do is remind him that his connections with Malingre and the Orleanists have placed him at our mercy.</p>
<p>Write soon, and assure Szemere that in me he has a sincere admirer.</p>
<p>Yours</p>
<p>Ch. Williams<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup></p>

The conspiratorial tactics of this group enabled the French and Prussian police, with the help of the agent-provocateur Cherval, who headed one of the Paris communities and at the same time was in the pay of the Prussian and French police, to fabricate the case of the so-called Franco-German plot. In February 1852 the accused were sentenced on a charge of plotting a coup d'état. Cherval was allowed to escape from prison. Attempts of the Prussian police to incriminate the Communist League led by Marx and Engels failed. Marx publicly exposed these provocations in his Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne and Herr Vogt (see present edition, vols. 11 and 17)</span>

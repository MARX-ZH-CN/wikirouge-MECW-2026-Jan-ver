MARX TO JOHANN PHILIPP BECKER</p>
<p>IN GENEVA</p>
<p>[Postcard]</p>
<p>London, 10 December 1881</p>
<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>You may have already learned from the papers of my wife's death (she breathed her last on 2 December). You will find it natural enough that, during the first days following upon this irreplaceable loss, I should have been in no state to write letters; in fact, apart from her brother, Edgar von Westphalen, in Berlin you are the <i>only one</i> whom I have so far informed in person; other friends and acquain- tances have been notified by my youngest daughter.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>To the last my wife remained your loyal friend and was rightly in- censed by the party's failure to help you — a man who has, for so many years, been a staunch and heroic standard bearer — and your loyal spouse<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> in your struggle for existence.</p>
<p>I myself am still an invalid, but on the road to recovery; so serious a grip had pleurisy combined with bronchitis gained over me that for a time, i. e. several days, the doctors doubted whether I would pull through.</p>
<p>Farewell, dear friend. Regards to your wife.</p>
<p>K. M.</p>

ENGELS TO HERMANN SCHLÜTER</p>
<p>IN HOTTINGEN-ZURICH</p>
<p>London, 17 January 1885</p>
<p>Dear Mr Schlüter,</p>
<p>As regards the <i>Anti-Dühring,</i> I would further advise you that 1) the old preface is followed by another to the 2nd edition which, however, I can't really do as yet; so doubtless you will, as usual, begin with the actual text and leave preface and title to the last; 2) such additions as there are will appear as an appendix.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>I have heard from Bonn<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>that the <i>Origin of the Family etc.</i> is not obtainable in the bookshops; according to the booksellers they have had word from Switzerland — from the publisher — that the book has been <i>banned</i> and various friends have been bombarding me with inquiries as to where the book may be obtained. Since there has, to my knowledge, been no <i>public</i> ban, while a <i>secret</i> ban would be nonsensical, and since the assumption that Zurich has been spreading rumours of a ban is even more nonsensical, I find the matter puzzling. Could it be that the government, to spare itself the ridicule that would come of a public ban, has persuaded Schabelitz's agents in Leipzig to spread such things about and thus make sales more difficult? Perhaps you would be good enough to start inquiries over there and let me know the result; I shall also try to find out whether the same tactics are being pursued elsewhere.</p>
<p>What is Ede doing? I have had neither sight nor sound of him.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>F. Engels

<br>Note from MECW :

<blockquote>
<br>The banquet arranged by Blanquist refugees took place in London on February 25, 1850. It was attended by revolutionary refugees of various nationalities, including Karl Marx, Frederick Engels and Ferdinand Wolff.
<br>A report on the banquet was published in The Northern Star No. 645, March 2, 1850. Engels' toast was mentioned along with the others, but its author was not named.
<br>A more detailed report on the banquet appeared in the Westdeutsche Zeitung No. 51 (the newspaper bears the number 50, which is mistaken) on March 1, 1850, and was marked "London, February 26". This report was also reprinted in the Dresdener Zeitung No. 55, March 5, 1850. Other versions describing the banquet appeared in the Neue Deutsche Zeitung No. 55, March 5, 1850, and in Die Hornisse No. 54, March 5, 1850. The latter mentioned that the guests included the editors of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, Marx, Engels and Wolff, that Engels raised a toast in honour of the June insurgents, and Wolff of the revolution without phraseology.

</blockquote>
<br>Citizen Engels, editor of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, made a speech in French which he ended, amidst thunderous applause, with a toast to the June insurgents.

MARX TO JOHN MALCOLM LUDLOW<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>IN LONDON
<br>[London,] 10 April 1869
<br>1 Modena Villas, Maitland Park,<br>
Haverstock Hill, N. W.
<br>Dear Sir,
<br>Being aware of your services to the working class, I should before this have given myself the pleasure of sending you my last work: <i>Das Kapital</i> (2nd and 3d volumes not yet published<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> ), if I had known you to be a German reader.
<br>In your article on Lassalle in the <i>Fortnightly</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> you say first that Lassalle propagated my principles in Germany and say then that I am propagating 'Lassallean principles' in England. This would indeed be what the French call <b>un échange de bons procédés<i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> .</i></b>
<br>In the volume I send you, you will find (Preface, p. VIII, note <i>1)</i> the plain facts stated viz. that 'Lassalle has taken from my writings almost literally <i>all his general theoretical developments',</i> but that I 'have nothing whatever to do with <i>his practical applications</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> <i></i>
<br>His practical nostrum, government aid to co-operative societies, I call by courtesy <i>his.</i> It belongs in fact to, and was zealously preached, at the time of Louis Philippe, by <i>Monsieur Bûchez,</i> Ex-St. Simonian, author of the<br>
<i>Histoire Parlementaire de la Révolution Française,</i> glorifying Robespierre <i>and</i> the Holy Inquisi- tion.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> M. Bûchez put forward his views, f.i. in the journal
<br><i>L'Atelier,</i> in<br>
<i>opposition</i> to the radical views of the<br>
French communism of that time.
<br>Since you quote my reply to Proudhon: <i>Misère de la Philosophie,</i> you cannot but be aware from its last chapter that in 1847, when all the political economists and all the socialists concurred on one single point—the condemnation of <i>trades'</i> <i>unions,</i> I demonstrated their historical necessity.
<br>Yours truly
<br>Karl Marx J. M. Ludlow, Esq.

In 1863, he evolved the final plan for a four-book work, the first three books theoretical and the fourth, a historical and critical one. Having finished work on the manuscripts of 1861-63, Marx began preparing them for the press in August 1863.<br>This work from 1863-65 resulted in the third rough draft of<i> Capital,</i> three books of a theoretical character. The notes for the fourth book, the<i> Theories of Surplus-Value,</i> were incorporated in the manuscripts of 1861-63. Later, having completed work on them, Marx went back to the first book. On Engels' advice, he decided it should appear first. Preparation for the press continued throughout 1866 and most of 1867. The first German edition of the first book appeared in September 1867 as Volume One of<i> Capital.</i> Under the plan agreed upon with Meissner, the publisher, the second and third books (devoted to the circulation of capital and the process of capitalist production as a whole) were to appear as Volume Two, while the fourth book on the history of economic theories was to be Volume Three of<i> Capital. </i><br>Marx, however, had not completed the preparation of the last books of <i>Capital</i> for the press. After his death, this was done by Engels, who published Marx's manuscripts relating to the second and third books as volumes Two and Three of<i> Capital</i> (1885 and 1894). Engels also intended to prepare for the press and publish as Volume Four of<i> Capital</i> the above-mentioned manuscript of the fourth book, but did not have time to do this in his lifetime. This edition presents this book of<i> Capital</i> as part of the<i> Economic Manuscripts of 1861-63, </i> (volumes 30-34) while Volumes One, Two and Three of<i> Capital</i> are to be found in volumes 35, 36 and 37 of the present edition respectively.</br></br></span>

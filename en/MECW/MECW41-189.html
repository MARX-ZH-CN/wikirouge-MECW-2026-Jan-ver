MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 6 November 1861</p>
<p>Dear Frederick,</p>
<p>You must excuse me for my failure to send a more prompt acknowledgement of the £5, ditto the wine. Very many thanks for both. It so happened that I have been very busy of late, on top of which I have had a great deal of domestic BOTHER.</p>
<p>Once again, the <i>Tribune's</i> front page calls attention to an article of mine as 'MOST INTERESTING'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Odd the way these YANKEES<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> hand out <i>testimonia</i> to their own CORRESPONDENTS. I had an answer from my old lady<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> yesterday. 'Soft' words, BUT NO CASH. She also tells me what I have long known, namely that she is 75 and is suffering from many of the infirmities of old age.</p>
<p>Up till now I have also been vainly trying to raise a LOAN over here. The guarantors I was able to produce were not, as I had in any case already suspected, sufficiently respectable. Many chaps have been more fortunate in this line. E.g. that scoundrel Beta got £50 out of a LOAN society on the guarantee of Mr—Edgar Bauer!</p>
<p>Russia's goings-on in Poland aren't bad at all. No less nice are the GESTS and EXPLOITS of handsome William.<sup>3D9</sup></p>
<p>You may perhaps have seen from the German, or also from some of the English newspapers, with what persistent importunity citizen and statesman Blind is 'blossoming' into a German Mazzini.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Apropos. While you were away,<sup>3fi0</sup> I received <i>avis<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> </i> from Holland that Lassalle's books<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> had <i>not</i> been received by my cousin<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> . Perhaps you would be so good as to make inquiries about it.</p>
<p>Write soon, for I have an especial need of your letters during what is still a highly critical interlude for me.</p>
<p>If you have a moment, could you write me a report on the Armstrong controversy<sup>361</sup> for the <i>Presse?</i></p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

ENGELS TO ELISABETH ENGELS</p>
<p>IN BARMEN</p>
<p>Manchester, 13 February 1861</p>
<p>Dear Mother,</p>
<p>I am returning herewith the contracts, 7 copies, duly signed, having kept the 8th here.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I must say that, if it hadn't been for your sake, I could have made up my mind to do so only with difficulty. It was hard for me thus to exclude myself for no valid reason or on no good pretext, or so it seemed to me, from the only family business that remains to us—remains with any <i>certainty.</i> I believe that I also had a right to it and that my brothers<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> had no right to assume that I should, without more ado and for no reason at all, relinquish that right in their favour. What I demanded was certainly not unfair; moreover, I had put forward that demand quite early enough for it to be taken into account during the deliberations. Emil Blank conceded as much when he was here. But I was told absolutely nothing more, and not till the others had settled everything did they approach me with the demand that I agree to forgo my claim, basing that demand—in Emil's letter—on reasons which may be very businesslike, but which I, for one, would not have cared to bring up in this way vis-à-vis my brothers; and, by way of consolation, I am left with Emil's <i>assurance</i> that Gottfr. Ermen, or so Emil is <i>convinced,</i> will not break his contract with me. This conviction is outweighed by that of our lawyer, who told Emil more than once that the contract <i>qua contract</i> affords me no legal guarantees. They have the business in Engelskirchen, and I have Emil's conviction.</p>
<p>Mother dear, I have swallowed all this and much more for your sake. Not for anything in the world would I contribute in the smallest way towards embittering the evening of your life with family disputes over inheritance. I believe that my conduct when I was at home,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> just like my letters, has amply demonstrated that I was very far from seeking to place obstacles in the way of any agreement and that, on the contrary, I gladly made sacrifices so that everything might be settled in accordance with your wishes. That is why I have signed the thing without more ado. Whatever the cost, I would not wish you to be plagued with such things any longer, or to worry about them. Nor shall I bear any grudge against my brothers, or so much as mention the matter to them, unless they absolutely force me to do so, for it has been settled, and I have no desire to parade my belief that I have made a sacrifice. But I considered it my bounden duty to tell you frankly what my motives were in this matter, and it goes without saying that I never remotely supposed you could, perhaps, have arranged matters more favourably for me. On the contrary, I know that, throughout the negotiations I, too, was always in your thoughts and that you did all you could for me.</p>
<p>The matter is now settled, and that is that. You are unlikely ever to hear another word from me about it, and I need not say that, when Emil comes over here, I shall, as always, give him a fraternal welcome; though our views may have differed in this case, he is, nevertheless, a fine lad, who has always taken my interests over here very much to heart.</p>
<p>The dressing-gown has arrived, and I am very glad of it as it's freezing again, but the red epaulettes are a trifle <i>outré</i> for local taste. By the way, I now have the company of a young ratter, who has strayed into the house.</p>
<p>I hope you have got over your cold all right; it will also do you good to be freed from all the worry about the inheritance. But still, if possible, you should buy the Sieg.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Warmest regards to Hermann, Rudolf, the Blanks and the Boellings.</p>
<p>With much love,</p>
<p>Your son</p>
<p>Friedrich

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">After the death of Engels' father in March 1860, his brothers proposed that he should renounce his title to the family concern in Engelskirchen in their favour. One of their arguments was that he had lived abroad since 1849. By way of compensation, he was to receive £10,000 to consolidate his legal and financial standing with the Ermen &amp; Engels firm in Manchester, of which Engels hoped eventually to become a co-owner. His brothers' proposal infringed Engels' rights, since under English law the transfer of a deceased co-owner's title was highly complicated and problematic. Engels had lengthy talks with Gottfried Ermen on the terms of his continued collaboration with the firm (see this volume, pp. 134-35). It was not until 25 September 1862 that a contract was signed providing for Engels' eventual partnership. He became a co-owner in 1864 (see this volume, p. 548).</span>

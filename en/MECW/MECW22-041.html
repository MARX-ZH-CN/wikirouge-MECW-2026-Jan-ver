<blockquote>
<p>This and other refutations (see this volume, pp. 393, 405) were written by Marx in reply to the libellous article about the International Working Men's Association published in the Berlin National-Zeitung on July 30, 1871. Excerpts from it were reprinted in several bourgeois London newspapers, including L'International, which also made new attacks on Marx.</p>
<p>The refutation was published in full in Der Volksstaat in an item about the National-Zeitung libel on the International. The rough draft in French contains some additions in Engels' hand.

<p>Sir,</p>
<p>In an article entitled " 'The International' Society" you say: "Beside their strict economies, the infatuated workers provide the members of the Council with every desirable comfort for leading a pleasant life in London." <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>I would point out to you that, with the exception of the General Secretary, who receives a salary of 10 shillings per week, all the members of the Council carry out their duties gratuitously, and have always done so.</p>
<p>I demand that you insert these lines in your next issue.</p>
<p>If your paper continues to spread such lies, legal action will be taken against it.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p><i><b>K. Marx</b></i></p>
<p><b>London, August 17, 1871</b>

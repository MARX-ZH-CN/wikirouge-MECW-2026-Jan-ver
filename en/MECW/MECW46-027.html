ENGELS TO JOHANN PHILIPP BECKER</p>
<p>IN GENEVA</p>
<p>London, 12 October 1880</p>
<p>Dear Old Man,</p>
<p>I've heard from Liebknecht that you're still short of cash but that they can't help you just now. By a lucky chance I was on the point of putting a five pound note on one side for you and have lost no time in changing it into a money order for 126 frs. I trust it reaches you safely and soon and will tide you over your initial difficulties until such time as the Leipzigers can do something for you. And so they damned well ought. You're certainly as much a victim of the Exceptional Law<sup>6</sup> as the agitators in Germany who have been deprived of their livelihood.</p>
<p>Liebknecht was here<sup>60</sup> and promised that the Zurich paper<sup>a</sup> would adopt a different attitude in keeping with the party's former attitude. If that is done, it's all we ask.</p>
<p>Adieu and keep your pecker up.</p>
<p>Your old friend</p>
<p>F. Engels

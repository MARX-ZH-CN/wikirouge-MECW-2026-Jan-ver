MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>Zalt-Bommel, 22 December 1863</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>You will see from the address that I am back in Holland, where I arrived safely yesterday. In Trier, where the papers and effects left by my mother had been placed under seal, the unsealing could not take place because the Dutch powers of attorney, which must pass through the hands of an endless succession of authorities, had not yet arrived. I left a power of attorney for my brother-in-law Conradi for submission to the Department of Trier and proceeded to headquarters here, firstly because my uncle<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> holds by far the largest part of the assets, secondly because he is the executor of the will. However, in any case it will be another 5-6 weeks before I receive payment of the money. Since my wife has to pay a butcher's BILL for £10 on 10 January 1864 (i.e. a <i>bill of exchange),</i> I should be very glad if you could attend to it.</p>
<p>The carbuncle has gone the way of all flesh, but now for good measure my back is wickedly plagued with furuncles and last night, for example, thanks to these pestilential objects, I couldn't get a wink of sleep which would, after all, only have been fair after travelling here from Frankfurt a.M. The husband<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> of a cousin<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> of mine is the town's only doctor and medical officer of health, so I am not in want of Aesculapian assistance.</p>
<p>Throughout the Rhine Province, from Trier to Frankfurt a.M. and thence via Giessen and Cologne right up to the Dutch frontier, I heard nothing but abuse of Prussia. Little, very little, Schleswig-Holsteinianism. For the most part, it was regarded as 'Prussian artfulness'.</p>
<p>I spent only one day in Frankfurt (where I had to visit two old aunts)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> and hence wasn't able to see any publishers. However, I spoke to an acquaintance who will write to me <i>here</i> (after he has consulted with a publisher on my behalf).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>When writing your pamphlet<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> it might be better if you were now to include some actual events as well, not forgetting the systematic blunders perpetrated by the Prussian government, the men of Progress<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> and the regular—since 1815 inveterate— Schleswig-Holstein HUMBUGGERS.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>You might drop me a line or two. Address Charles Marx, CARE OF Mr Lion Philips, Zalt-Bommel, Holland.</p>

The<i> Party of Progress,</i> formed in June 1861, spoke for the German bourgeoisie. Its slogans were the unification of Germany under the aegis of Prussia, the convocation of an all-German Parliament, and the formation of a strong liberal Ministry responsible to the Chamber of Deputies. Fearing a popular revolution, the Party of Progress gave no support to the basic democratic demands — universal suffrage, freedom of the press, freedom of association and freedom of assembly.</span>

<li id="cite_note-8"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-8">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The<i> Schleswig-Holstein question</i> was prominent in nineteenth-century European diplomacy. The Congress of Vienna (1815) recognised the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein to be possessions of Denmark in personal union with the Danish King. At the same time, Holstein was declared a member of the German Confederation. During the 1848-49 revolution, an anti-Danish national liberation movement developed in the duchies which was, however, defeated.
At a conference in London attended by representatives of Austria, Britain, Denmark, France, Russia and Sweden, a protocol on the Danish succession was signed on 2 August 1850 which proclaimed the indivisibility of the Danish Crown possessions, including the two duchies. This document formed the basis for the London Protocol of 8 May 1852 on the integrity of the Danish monarchy (see Note 380).
Denmark's attempts to fully subject the duchies aggravated Danish-Prussian relations and were exploited as a pretext for intervention by Prussia, which regarded the reunification of Schleswig and Holstein with Germany as the first step towards the union of Germany under Prussia's aegis.</span>

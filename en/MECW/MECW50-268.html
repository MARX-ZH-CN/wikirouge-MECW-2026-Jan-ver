ENGELS TO JULIUS MOTTELER</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 23 February 1895<br>
41 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Julius,</p>
<p>One Theodor Barlen,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>the bearer of a card from the Dortmund club, has called on me seeking assistance. He is a deserter, having decamped from Spandau, and alleges that he was previously a very active party member in Hörde, Dortmund, etc. I referred him to the Society. 62 He came back today to say that the Society refused to recommend him to me, since they did not know whether the papers he produced were his own. As I should like to have some information on the man so as to know whether I ought not to send him packing once and for all, I would ask you to tell me whether this accords with the facts and, once his case has been investigated, what view they take of him at the Society. 516</p>
<p>Many regards to your wife and yourself from</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F. Engels

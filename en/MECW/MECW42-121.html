<p><i>To Engels in Manchester</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 5 January 1866</b></p>
<p><b>Dear Fred</b>,</p>
<p><i>In the greatest of haste.</i></p>
<p>Best thanks for the £10.</p>
<p>The bill of exchange falls due on 18 February, and is for £48. I wanted the <b>landlord</b> to draw it only for the 2 terms that were due and not for the third one as well, which is not due until the end of January. But he insisted.</p>
<p>A plot has been hatched against the <b>International Association</b> in which connection I need your co-operation. Further details later. For the moment, suffice to say: Mr Le Lubez and Vesinier (the latter well aware that an <b>Inquiry</b> into his past is in progress; he is in Brussels again) have a French branch here (<b>in fact</b> an opposition branch); Longuet, the editor of <i>Rive gauche,</i> also belongs to it, and it is tied up with all that pack of Proudhonists in Brussels. Vesinier began by publishing a long screed against us in the <i>Echo de Verviers,</i> <b>of course anonymously</b>. Then, in the <i>same</i> paper which is putting out the <b>slanders</b> against our Association (among other things, falsely calls Tolain and Fribourg Bonapartists, too), the London <b>Branch</b> published a programme, a draft of future statutes, which <i>they,</i> the Faithful, are going to put to the Congress.</p>
<p>The real crux of the controversy is the <i>Polish question.</i> The fellows have all attached themselves to the Muscovitist line pursued by Proudhon and Herzen. I shall therefore send you the earlier articles by the oracles in the <i>Tribune du Peuple</i> against Poland and you must do a refutation, either for our papers in Geneva (the 'German' one) or for <i>The Workman's Advocate.</i> The Russian gentlemen have acquired some bran-new allies in the Proudhonised section of 'Jeune France'.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.

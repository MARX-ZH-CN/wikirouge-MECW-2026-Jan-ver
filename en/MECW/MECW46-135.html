ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN</p>
<p>IN ZURICH</p>
<p>London, 17 April 1882</p>
<p>Dear Mr Bernstein,</p>
<p>As soon as I heard from Lavrov that the preface<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>had appeared in the <i>Narodnaya Volya</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>I asked for a copy of the original,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>but he had left it in his desk in Paris; however, he said he would write. Then I went to Marx's and searched in vain for the <i>brouillon.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>Finally I got Lavrov to let me have a copy of the Russian translation so that, if the worst came to the worst, I could retranslate it myself; I feared, as indeed happened, that some Russian or other would see to this. Lavrov has just sent me the enclosed copy of the original. However, I have only myself to blame for this. For I had meant to send you a postcard, but have got Schorlemmer and Adolf Beust staying with me, and there's quite a lot of gadding about with Mrs Lafargue (whose husband<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>is in Paris) and Tussy Marx, so that the postcard got overlooked. But in order that you may see that good intentions were not wanting, I am belatedly sending you the thing.</p>
<p>Congratulations on your attack upon Geiser's spineless conduct.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Confidential: Marx has been in Algiers since 21 February. On arrival he had a fresh attack of pleurisy as a result of catching cold on the journey; he found wretched weather conditions, but is now pretty well all right again. How long he'll stay there is not yet certain. Has had distinctly bad luck with the weather.</p>
<p>Kindest regards from</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F. Engels

<p><i>To Engels in Manchester</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 18 May 1855, 28 Dean Street, Soho</b></p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>My wife has been <i>confined to bed</i> since yesterday evening. As I cannot draw a bill before a week on Tuesday (next), I should be much obliged if you could send me some money (however little).</p>
<p>The devil take the <i>Tribune</i>! Certainly it is now absolutely essential that it should adopt an <i>anti-pan-Slav</i> line. If it doesn't, one might be compelled to break with the rag, which would be disastrous.</p>
<p>As you will have seen in an earlier no. of the Augsburg <i>Allgemeine</i>, as from next August, the great Herzen will be bringing out a Russian periodical here, the <i>Polar Star</i>.</p>
<p>My warm regards to Lupus.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.

<br>Dear Engels,
<br>Your letter didn't reach me till today<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> as I had already left Bremen on Wednesday morning. Nothing doing in Bremen. Rösing went bankrupt a year ago and is now living solely on the interest from what remains of his wife's capital. Hence nothing doing.
<br>On the other hand I shall certainly be able to make shift here.
<br>As for the signature, cannot <em>Werres</em> sign?
<br>18 April 1849
<br>As for interim money arrangements, as long as I'm away the following should be noted: before I left, Plasmann solemnly promised to make whatever advances were necessary. Perhaps St. Naut feels some scruple about resorting to this source. If necessary, do <em>so yourself.</em>
<br>All this week the paper has been very skimpy, which assorts ill with my present mission.
<br>Warmest regards to my wife and the others.
<br>Write by return whatever happens, and keep your chin up. <em>Les choses marcheront</em>.
<br>Your<br>K. Marx
<br>[Inside the envelope]
<br>Address: Rohde, Merchant, Bleichenbrücke.

He visited Bremen, Hamburg and the neighbouring towns, including Hamburg. On his way back to Cologne Marx stopped at Bielefeld and Hamm. The purpose of the trip was to strengthen contacts between the Communist League members and workers' associations in preparation for the creation of a mass proletarian party, to discuss problems of revolutionary tactics with members of the working-class and democratic movements, and to raise funds for the continued publication of the <em>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</em>. In Marx's absence Engels directed the newspaper.<br><br>Engels' letter to Marx mentioned here has not been found.</br></br></span>

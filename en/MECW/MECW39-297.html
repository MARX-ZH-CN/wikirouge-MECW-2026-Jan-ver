<p>Dear Mr Engels,</p>
<p>As you see, I am still <i>en fonction</i> as secretary. My husband has still not altogether left his bed. He was indeed very poorly. Tomorrow he will attempt to take a short walk. His illness prevented him from getting anything done for America, although he did manage to strike some sparks out of Freiligrath and Pieper. I enclose herewith a most felicitous poem of Freiligrath's. Let our friend Weerth have a look at it as well. Perhaps he too will feel inspired to climb onto Pegasus. Send us the <i>Tribune</i> if you have finished with it. Next week you will receive a very nice letter from Cluss. Lupus hasn't got it just now. We hope to hear from you soon and may you enjoy your <b>pale ale</b> in the meantime.</p>
<p>Warm regards from the patient.<br>Jenny Marx
</p>

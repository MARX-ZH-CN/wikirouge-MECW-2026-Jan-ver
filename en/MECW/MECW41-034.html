MARX TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p><i>[Draft]</i></p>
<p>Manchester, 27 February 1860<br>6 Thorncliffe Grove, Oxford Road</p>
<p>Dear Liebknecht,</p>
<p>You should let Schapper have a look at Vogt's book.<sup>3</sup> Go and see him. He will tell you what I've written to him.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the letter from my lawyer in Berlin,<sup>1</sup>' which arrived yesterday, things are going well. The information I sent him included what was required in respect of yourself. Deal thoroughly with all that part of Vogt's book relating to you, so that I can have it at any time. But stick absolutely <i>rigidly</i> to the FACTS.</p>
<p>Next, it is essential that the resolution backing me and censuring Vogt, adopted by the Workers' Educational Society on 6 February I860<sup>1</sup> and signed by the Society's chairman,'<sup>1</sup> should be authenti- cated <i>immédiatement</i> (i.e. the signature) before the magistrate. So, have a word with Weber<sup>1</sup> if necessary.</p>
<p>Kindest regards to your wife and yourself.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

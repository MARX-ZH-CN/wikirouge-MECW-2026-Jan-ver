<h2 class="mw-headline" id="ME17-24-2">1. Schily's Expulsion from Switzerland</h2><a id="1._Schily's_Expulsion_from_Switzerland"></a><p>
A letter from Schily about his expulsion from Switzerland which exemplifies the treatment meted out to non-parliamentary refugees.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> can unfortunately only be printed in extract, owing to lack of space. The letter begins by recounting how two German refugees, B. and I.,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> both friends of Schily, left Geneva, were arrested during their journey through Switzerland and, having been liberated by Druey, returned again to <i>Geneva</i>.</p><blockquote><p>"At their request," Schily continues, "I went to Fazy to find out whether anyone was looking for them and he reassured me by saying that there was no reason at Cantonal level to disturb their incognito and that no inquiries about them had reached him at Federal level either. I would do well, however, to have an interview with the <i>chef du département de justice et de police</i>, M. Girard, mentioning his name and what he had told me. This I did, with more or less the same success and leaving my address behind in case there were any Federal inquiries. A few weeks later I was visited by a police officer who requested me to give him the address of B. and I. I refused, hurried around to the aforementioned Girard and upon being threatened by him with expulsion unless I gave him the address, I explained to him that according to our previous agreement I could be appealed to as an <i>intermédiaire</i>, but not as a <i>dénonciateur</i>. To which he replied: 'Vous avez l'air de vouloir vous interposer comme ambassadeur entre moi et ces réfugiés, pour traiter de puissance à puissance.'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> I replied: Je n'ai pas l'ambition d'être accrédité ambassadeur près de vous.'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> And in fact I was then dismissed , without any of the ceremony to which ambassadors are entitled. On my way home I learnt that B. and I. had just been discovered, and that they had been arrested and led off, so that I could regard Girard's threat as superseded by events. But I had reckoned without April 1, for on this ominous day in 1852 I was requested by a police officer, in the middle of the street, to accompany him to the Hôtel de Ville, where some questions were to be put to me. Once arrived there it was explained to me by State Councillor Tourte, the Genevan Commissar for the expulsion of refugees and <i>ad latus</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> to Trog, his counterpart at Federal level, who happened to be in Geneva at the time, that I was expelled and that he must send me to Berne without delay; all of this to his greatest regret, since there was no complaint against me at Cantonal level, but the Federal Commissar insisted on my expulsion. To my request to be allowed to see the latter he replied: 'Non, nous ne voulons pas que le commissaire fédéral fasse la police ici.'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> This statement, of course, contradicted his earlier one and in general he now abandoned his role of Genevan State Councillor, which consisted in resisting Federal demands for expulsion with liberal prudery, in yielding only to force, sometimes also yielding, with pleasure or resignation, to the application of gentle pressure<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> Another feature of this role was to noise it abroad that the person expelled was a spy and that it had been necessary to remove him in the interests of the 'good cause'.... Thus Tourte told the refugees afterwards that he had had to get rid of me because I was in league with the Federal Commissar, together with whom I had sought to frustrate <i>his</i> (Tourte's) measures to protect the refugees, i.e. that I was in league with the same Commissar who, much to <i>his</i> regret, had given orders to expel me. <i>Quelles tartines!</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> What lies and contradictions! And all for a little <i>aura popularis!</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> Of course, wind is what that gentleman uses to keep his balloon airborne. Grand Councillor and State Councillor of Geneva, member of the Swiss Council of States or National Council, a born Counsellor of Confusion, he needs only to become a member of the Federal Council<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> to ensure that Switzerland will enjoy peaceful days in accordance with the saying: <i>Providentia Dei et confusione hominum Helvetia salva fuit</i>."<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> </p></blockquote><p>On arriving in London Schily sent a letter of protest about Tourte's slander to the Genevan <i>Indépendant</i>, which was under the influence of <i>Raisin</i>, whom we shall mention later, and which had shortly before printed a scathing attack on the assinine slanderous fabrications with which "the liberal <i>faiseurs</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> were driving the refugees out of Switzerland". His letter was <i>not</i> published.</p><blockquote><p>"From the Hôtel de Ville in Geneva," Schily continues, "I was transferred to gaol, and on the following day I was sent by mail coach to Berne with a police guard. There M. Druey held me in close confinement for two weeks in the so-called Old Tower...."</p></blockquote><p>In his correspondence with the imprisoned Schily, which we shall refer to in due course, <i>Druey</i> placed all the guilt on the Canton of Geneva, while for his part Tourte had asserted that the entire responsibility lay with the Federal authorities, since <i>there was no complaint against him on the part of the Canton of Geneva</i>. He had received a similar assurance shortly before from <i>Raisin</i>, the Genevan examining magistrate. Schily has this to say, among other things, about the latter gentleman:</p><blockquote><p>"On the occasion of the Federal Shooting Competition which was held in Geneva in the summer of 1851, <i>Raisin</i> had taken over the editorship of the <i>Journal du tir fédéral</i>, which appeared in French and German. He engaged me to work on the paper, promising me a fee of 300 francs in exchange for which I was supposed <i>inter alia</i> to record <i>flagrante delicto</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> the opening and closing speeches in German of the President of the Committee Tourte. I owe a debt of gratitude to Tourte for having made my task much easier by his habit of addressing more or less the same enthusiastic words to the various deputations of marksmen, varying his phrases slightly according to whether he was eulogising the Bear of Berne, the Bull of Uri<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup> or other members of the Confederation. In particular, when he would come to the refrain 'But if the moment of danger ever arrives, then we shall, etc.', I would calmly lay down my pen and when <i>Raisin</i> asked <i>why</i>, I could answer: <i>c'est le refrain du danger, je le sais par coeur</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup> Instead of my hard-earned fee of 300 francs, I managed only to extract 100 from <i>Raisin</i>, and only with the greatest difficulty although he did open up the prospect of collaborating on a political review he intended to establish in Geneva in order to be independent of all the existing parties and be able to oppose any side and especially the then 'liberal' government of Fazy and Tourte, even though he belonged to it himself. He was the very man for such an enterprise—able, as he used to boast, 'd'arracher la peau à qui que ce soit'....<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup> Accordingly, he commissioned me to establish contacts for this journal in the course of a journey through Switzerland which I undertook after my Federal Shooting labours. I did so and on my return I drew up a written report on the results achieved. In the meantime, however, the wind had begun to blow from another direction and he found himself returning full sail from his expedition of piracy into the peaceful harbour of the existing government. <i>J'en étais donc pour mes frais et honoraires</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup> for which I vainly pestered him and continue to do so to this day, and have still received nothing even though he is now a wealthy man.... Shortly before my arrest he asserted categorically that there was no question of my being expelled, his friend Tourte had himself assured him that it was not necessary for me to take any preventive measures with regard to Girard's threats, etc. ... In reply to a letter which I sent him <i>de profundis</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" id="cite_ref-18">[18]</a></sup> from my old prison tower, asking him for a small instalment of the money he owed me and for an explanation of the incident (my arrest, etc.), he preserved a stubborn silence, even though he assured the person who brought him the message that he would comply with all my requests....</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"A few months later I received a letter from K.,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" id="cite_ref-19">[19]</a></sup> a reliable, unprejudiced man, informing me that my expulsion had been the work of the refugee <i>parliamentarians</i>, and this was confirmed <i>mordicus</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" id="cite_ref-20">[20]</a></sup> by a few lines written by <i>Ranickel</i>, which he enclosed. This view was also confirmed by many experienced observers with whom I later had an opportunity to discuss the matter.... Yet I did not hate the parliamentarians like that hyena <i>Reinach</i>, who used to drag the late-lamented Imperial Regent <i>Vogt</i>, day after day, from the Imperial tomb to the dinner table in Berne where Vogt sat like the reincarnation of the 'chained Prometheus', and then, <i>entre poire et fromage</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" id="cite_ref-21">[21]</a></sup> would savagely devour both his mummy and the reincarnated form to the horror of those present. It is true that I was no admirer of the parliamentarians' deeds, quite the reverse! But is it likely that these gentlemen intended to punish me for this by an Imperial ban—regarding ding Switzerland as part of the Empire because both the Imperial Constitution,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" id="cite_ref-22">[22]</a></sup> and the most recent resolution of the Imperial Diet lie buried there? I think it more likely that the presumption of their persecution of myself is connected with the parliamentary rebellion mentioned in my previous letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23" id="cite_ref-23">[23]</a></sup> against the Geneva Refugee Committee formed by myself, Becker and a number of Genevan citizens.... Why these gentlemen wished to usurp the right to distribute the refugee funds was a matter about which even they differed among themselves. Some of them, among them Dentzel from the little Chamber of Baden, <i>preferred</i>, contrary to <i>our</i> practice of giving aid above all to penniless workers, to wipe away the tears of professional sufferers, heroes of the revolution, patriotic sons of the nation, who had seen better days.... <i>Is fecit cui prodest</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24" id="cite_ref-24">[24]</a></sup> as the saying goes in the trade, and since my activities were, it is true, inconvenient to these gentlemen, the suspicion arose that they had made use of their influence in important places to bring about my removal. It was known that they had the <i>aurem principis</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25" id="cite_ref-25">[25]</a></sup> or, at any rate, they were close enough to it to whisper something or other about my <i>restiveness</i>, and that <i>princeps</i> Tourte especially had frequently gathered them around himself...."</p></blockquote><p>Having described how he was moved from the Old Tower in Berne to Basle and then over the French frontier, Schily continues:</p><blockquote><p>"As far as the expense entailed in expelling refugees is concerned, I cherish the hope that the costs were defrayed not by the Federal Treasury, but by that of the Holy Alliance. For one day a considerable time after our entry into Switzerland, <i>Princess</i> <b>Olga</b> was sitting at luncheon in a Berne restaurant with the <i>Russian</i> chargé d'affaires there<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26" id="cite_ref-26">[26]</a></sup> <i>Entre poire et fromage</i> (<i>sans comparaison</i> to the terrible <i>Reinach</i>) Her Highness remarked to her table companion: 'Eh bien, Monsieur le baron, avez-vous encore beaucoup de réfugiés ici?' 'Pas mal, Princesse,' he replied, 'bien que nous en ayons déjà beaucoup renvoyé. M. Druey fait de son mieux à cet égard, <i>et si de nouveaux fonds nous arrivent</i>, nous en renverrons bien encore.'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27" id="cite_ref-27">[27]</a></sup> This was overheard and passed on to me by the waiter on duty, a quondam volunteer in the Imperial campaign where he served under my august command."</p></blockquote><p>During Schily's removal his travel-effects vanished mysteriously and irretrievably.</p><blockquote><p>"It has remained a mystery to this very day how my effects could have vanished in Le Havre from the chaos of bundles accompanying a German émigré train (into which we had been incorporated in Basle by <i>Klenk</i>, the emigration agent, whom the Federal authorities had hired to transport us to Le Havre, with the result that all the luggage belonging to the refugees and emigrants had become hopelessly confused), <i>unless</i> it had been achieved <i>with the aid of a list of the refugees and their baggage</i>. Perhaps the Swiss Consul in Le Havre, the merchant <i>Wanner</i>, to whom we were sent for further transportation, knows more about it. He promised that we would be fully compensated. Druey later confirmed this promise in a letter which I sent to <i>Advocate Vogt in Berne</i> to enable him to pursue the matter in the Federal Council. However, I have not been able to get it back from him up to now, <i>nor have I ever received a reply to any of the letters I wrote to him</i>. On the other hand, in the summer of 1856 my complaint was rejected by the Federal Council and I was warned to keep the peace, without being given any reasons for this decision....</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"All this and all the expulsions involving so many gendarmes, handcuffs, etc., are mere trivia, however, compared to the peculiarly cosy good-neighbourly arrangement of sending home the so-called less serious offenders of the Baden campaign, providing them with special travel passes and directing them to report on their arrival to the local authorities where, instead of being allowed to resume their occupations, as they had been led to expect, they were subjected to all sorts of unexpected penances. The silent sufferings of all those extradited in this way (for extradition is the correct word) are still waiting for their chronicler and avenger.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"The Swiss Tacitus speaking of Switzerland says that it does a man credit 'if his faults may be mentioned without detracting from his greatness'. There is no lack of materials for praise of this kind; to praise Switzerland in this manner does not spoil its figure ... <i>qui aime bien châtie bien</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28" id="cite_ref-28">[28]</a></sup> And in fact I for my part have an irrepressible love for Switzerland by and large. I like both the country and the people. Keeping a gun as part of his household equipment, always ready and skilful in using it to protect historical traditions of good repute and modern achievements of good quality, the Swiss in my eyes definitely deserves respect. He is entitled to the sympathies of others because he himself feels sympathy for others who struggle to improve their situation. 'I would rather that God had lost his best pair of angels,' a Swiss farmer said in his annoyance at the failure of the South German uprising. He might not have been prepared to risk a team of <i>his</i> horses for it, but he would have been more likely to risk his skin and his gun. In his heart of hearts the Swiss is not <i>neutral</i>, even if he practises neutrality because of, and in order to preserve, his inherited possessions. Incidentally the old crust of neutrality which cloaks his better nature will probably soon burst asunder with all these foreign feet trampling on it—for that is after all the essence of neutrality—and there will be a big bang and that will clear the air."</p></blockquote><p>Thus far Schily's letter. In the Prison Tower in Berne he was not able to arrange a personal meeting with Druey, but he did manage to exchange letters with that gentleman. In reply to a letter from Schily inquiring into the reasons for his arrest and asking permission to consult his lawyer, Herr Wyss in Berne, Druey wrote on <i>April 9, 1852</i>:</p><blockquote><p>"... L'autorité genèvoise a ordonné votre renvoi du Canton, vous a fait arrêter et conduire à Berne à la disposition...<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29" id="cite_ref-29">[29]</a></sup> de mon département, parce que vous vous êtes montré un des réfugiés les plus remuants et que vous avez cherché à cacher I. et B., que vous vous étiez engagé à représenter à l'autorité. Pour ce motif et parce que votre séjour ultérieur en Suisse nuirait <i>aux relations internationales de la Confédération</i>, le Conseil fédéral a ordonné votre renvoi du territoire suisse, etc.... Comme votre arrestation n'a pas pour but un procès criminel ou correctionnel, mais <i>une mesure de haute politique</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30" id="cite_ref-30">[30]</a></sup> il n'est pas nécessaire que vous consultiez l'avocat. <i>D'ailleurs, avant de ... autoriser l'entrevue que vous me demandez avec M. l'avocat</i> Wyss, <i>je désire savoir le but de cette entrevue</i>.".<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31" id="cite_ref-31">[31]</a></sup> </p></blockquote><p>The letters which Schily was permitted, after numerous complaints, to write to his friends in Geneva had all to be submitted beforehand to M. Druey to inspect. In one of these letters Schily used the expression "<i>Vae</i> victis"<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32" id="cite_ref-32">[32]</a></sup> Druey wrote to him about it in a letter dated <i>April 19, 1852</i>:</p><blockquote><p>"Dans le billet que vous avez adressé à M. J.,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33" id="cite_ref-33">[33]</a></sup> se trouvent les mots: <i>vae victis</i>... Cela veut-il dire que les autorités fédérales vous traitent en vaincu? S'il en était ainsi, ce serait <i>une accusation mensongère</i>, contre laquelle je devrais protester.".<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34" id="cite_ref-34">[34]</a></sup> </p></blockquote><p>Schily replied to the mighty Druey in a letter dated <i>April 21, 1852</i>:</p><blockquote><p>"Je ne pense pas, M. le conseiller fédéral, que cette manière de caractériser les mesures prises à mon égard puisse me valoir le reproche d'une <i>accusation mensongère</i>; du moins un pareil reproche ne serait pas de nature à me faire revenir de l'idée que je suis traité avec dureté; au contraire, adressé à un <i>prisonnier, par celui qui le tient en prison</i>, une telle réponse me paraîtrait une dureté de plus."<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35" id="cite_ref-35">[35]</a></sup> </p></blockquote><p>Towards the close of <i>March 1852</i>, shortly before Schily's arrest and the deportation of other <i>unparliamentary</i> refugees, the reactionary <i>Journal de Genève</i> published all sorts of wild gossip about communist plots among the German refugees in Geneva: Herr Trog was said to be busy cleaning out a nest of German communists with a brood of 84 communist dragons inside it, etc. Alongside this reactionary Genevan paper a scribbler in Berne who belonged to the parliamentary gang—it must be assumed that it was <b>Karl Vogt</b> since he repeatedly claims in the "Magnum Opus" that it was he who had rescued Switzerland from the clutches of the communist refugees—was busy spreading similar news in the <i>Frankfurter Journal</i> over the initials "ss". For example, he wrote that the Genevan Committee to aid German refugees, a committee consisting of communists, had been overthrown because of its inequitable distribution of the available funds, and that it had been replaced by upright men (namely parliamentarians) who would soon put an end to these evil practices. He wrote further that the dictator of Geneva seemed at last to be prepared to comply with the ordinances of the Federal Commissars, since two German refugees belonging to the communist faction had shortly before been put under arrest and brought from Geneva to Berne, etc<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36" id="cite_ref-36">[36]</a></sup> The <i>Schweizerische National-Zeitung</i>, which appears in Basle, published an answer from Geneva in its issue No. 72, of <i>March 25, 1852</i>, in which it said <i>inter alia</i>:</p><blockquote><p>"Every unbiassed person knows that just as Switzerland is concerned only with the consolidation and constitutional development of its political achievements, so too the feeble remnants of the German emigration in this country are occupied entirely with earning their daily bread and other perfectly harmless pursuits, and that the fairy-tales about communism are the product of hallucinations on the part of philistines or else are concocted by politically or personally interested <i>informers</i>."</p></blockquote><p>After the Berne parliamentary correspondent of the <i>Frankfurter Journal</i> had been described as one of these <i>informers</i>—the article concludes:</p><blockquote><p>"The refugees here are of the opinion that in their ranks there are a number of so-called 'decent men' on the pattern of the former 'Biedermen and Bassermen of the Empire',<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37" id="cite_ref-37">[37]</a></sup> who, driven by nostalgia for the flesh-pots of home<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38" id="cite_ref-38">[38]</a></sup> seek to pave the way for their own pardon at the hands of their native rulers by reactionary expectorations of this kind. We should like to send them our best wishes for a speedy departure as they will then cease to compromise the refugees and the government that gives them asylum."</p></blockquote><p><i>Schily</i> was known to the refugee <i>parliamentarians</i> as the author of this article. It appeared in the Basle <i>National-Zeitung on March 25</i>, and on <i>April 1</i> Schily's wholly unmotivated arrest took place. "Tantaene animis caelestibus irae?"<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39" id="cite_ref-39">[39]</a></sup> </p><h2 class="mw-headline" id="ME17-24-3">2. The Revolutionary Congress in Murten</h2><p>
After the Murten scandal the German refugees in Geneva, with the exception of the. refugee <i>parliamentarians</i>, issued a protest addressed "To the Supreme Department of Justice and the Police of the Confederation", from which I print the following passage,:<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40" id="cite_ref-40">[40]</a></sup></p><blockquote><p>"... The monarchs did not rest content with their previous diplomatic gains. They rattled their sabres all around Switzerland and threatened military occupation so as to make a clean sweep of the refugees. The Federal Council at any rate has expressed its concern about this danger in an official document. And lo and behold! There were further deportations, justified this time by the notorious assembly in Murten and the claim that traces of political and propagandistic activities had been uncovered by the investigation following it. As far as the facts are concerned this claim must be categorically rejected.... From the legal point of view, however, it is important to bear in mind that wherever the rule of law obtains, <i>actions proscribed by the law can only be punished by penalties laid down by the law</i>, and this holds good for deportation too, if it is not to appear as the arbitrary action of the police. Or was perhaps here too the intention to play off <i>diplomacy</i> against us and to say: we have been forced to act thus out of <i>consideration for foreign powers</i>, in the interests of international relations? Very well, then, if this is the position, the <i>cross of the Confederation</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41" id="cite_ref-41">[41]</a></sup> should hide its head in shame before the <i>Turkish crescent</i>, which, when the myrmidons searching for refugees knock on the Porte<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42" id="cite_ref-42">[42]</a></sup> shows its horns and does not eat humble pie.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43" id="cite_ref-43">[43]</a></sup> If this is the position, then give us our passports so that we can go to <i>Turkey</i> and when the door has closed behind us, hand over the keys to the Swiss bastion of liberty to the <i>Holy Alliance</i> as <i>a feudum oblatum</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44" id="cite_ref-44">[44]</a></sup> and hold them in future as the insignia of chamberlains of the Holy Alliance, with the motto: <i>Finis Helvetiae!</i>"<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45" id="cite_ref-45">[45]</a></sup> </p></blockquote>
<h2 class="mw-headline" id="ME17-24-4">3. Cherval</h2><p>
I realised from Joh. Ph. Becker's letter that the "associate of Marx" or the "associates" of Cherval mentioned by the Vogt of the Empire<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46" id="cite_ref-46">[46]</a></sup> could only be Herr <i>Stecher</i>, now resident in London. Up to that time I had not had the honour of making his personal acquaintance, although I had heard many complimentary descriptions of his great and many-sided artistic talents. In consequence of Becker's letter we met for the first time. The following is a letter from my "associate" to me.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47" id="cite_ref-47">[47]</a></sup> </p><blockquote><p>"17 Sussex St., London W. C.
October 14, 1860</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"Dear Herr Marx,</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"I am glad to be able to give you some information about <i>Nugent</i> (Cherval-Crämer) who was mentioned in Vogt's pamphlet of which you were kind enough to send me an extract. In March 1853 I came to Geneva after a trip to Italy. Nugent arrived in Geneva at around the same time and I made his acquaintance in a lithography workshop. I had myself just taken up lithography and since Nugent had a thorough knowledge of it, and since he was extremely agreeable, energetic and industrious by nature, I accepted his proposal to share an atelier with him. What Vogt says about Nugent's activities in Geneva is roughly the same as what I heard for myself at the time, if you discount the usual exaggerations to be expected from journalists or pamphleteers. There was very little success. I knew only one of the group, a good-natured and hard-working, but otherwise imprudent and light-minded young man. And since he was one of the leaders it must be presumed that N. was everything in the group and the others nothing but curious listeners. I am convinced that neither stone nor copper plates were ever engraved, although I heard N. talk of such matters. My own acquaintances were mainly Genevans and Italians. I was aware that Iater on I was thought to be a spy by Vogt and other German refugees, whom I did not know. But I took no notice of it—the truth will always out. I was not even offended; it was so easy to arouse suspicion as there were spies aplenty and to discover who they were was not always a simple matter. I am almost certain that Nugent did not correspond with anyone in Geneva after he had been expelled from there. I later received two letters from him inviting me to join him in Paris to help him with a project on medieval architecture, which I did. In Paris I found Nugent to be utterly remote from politics and correspondence. All this of course suggests that I myself could be '<i>the associates of Marx</i>' since I neither saw nor heard of <i>anyone else whom Nugent had induced to come to Paris</i>. Of course Herr Vogt could not know that I had never had any contact with you, either direct or indirect, and that I probably never would have had, if I had not moved to London where by chance I have had the pleasure of meeting you and your esteemed family.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"With best wishes to you and your ladies,

<h2 class="mw-headline" id="ME17-24-5">4. The Communist Trial in Cologne</h2><p>
In this section I wish to make public information concerning the Prussian Embassy in London and its correspondence with Prussian authorities on the Continent during the Cologne trial. This information is based on the confessions of Hirsch which were published by A. <i>Willich</i> in April 1853 in the <i>New-Yorker Criminal-Zeitung</i> under the title "Die Opfer der Moucharderie, Rechtfer tigungsschrift von Wilhelm Hirsch".<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48" id="cite_ref-48">[48]</a></sup> Hirsch, who is at present in a Hamburg gaol, was the principal tool of Police Lieutenant Greif and his agent Fleury. It was on instructions from them and under their direction that he forged the <i>false</i> Minute-Book submitted as evidence by Stieber in the course of the communist trial. I give here a number of excerpts from Hirsch's memoirs.</p><blockquote><p>(During the Great Exhibition) "the German associations were kept under surveillance by a police triumvirate: Police Superintendent Stieber for Prussia, a Herr Kubesch for Austria and Police Commissioner Huntel of Bremen".</p></blockquote><p>Having volunteered to act as an informer, Hirsch had an interview in London with <i>Alberts</i> who was Secretary at the Prussian Embassy. He gives this account of their first meeting:</p><blockquote><p>"The meetings of the Prussian Embassy in London with its secret agents take place at a public house well fitted for the purpose. The Cock, in Fleet St., Temple Bar, is so unobtrusive that but for a golden cock pointing to the entrance the casual passer-by would hardly notice it. I went through a narrow passage leading to the interior of this old English tavern and asked for Mr. Charles, whereupon a corpulent personage introduced himself to me with such an amiable smile that anyone seeing us would have taken us to be old friends. The Embassy agent (for this is what he was) seemed to be in very high spirits and his mood was still further improved by brandy and water. He enjoyed it so much that for a long time he seemed to have completely forgotten the purpose of our meeting. Mr. Charles at once revealed that his true name was <i>Alberts</i> and that he was the <i>Embassy Secretary</i>. To begin with, he informed me that in fact he had nothing to do with the police but that he would act as an intermediary in this case... A second meeting took place at his home in 39 Brewer St., Golden Square, and it was here that I made the acquaintance of Police Lieutenant <i>Greif</i>. Greif looked the true policeman: medium height, dark hair and a beard of the same colour cut in the regulation style, with the moustache meeting the side-whiskers and the chin left shaven. His eyes looked anything but intelligent and they protruded fiercely in a permanent glare, apparently the result of frequent association with thieves and rogues.... Like Herr Alberts, Herr Greif introduced himself to me by the pseudonym of Mr. Charles. The latest Mr. Charles was at least in a more serious mood and he even felt it was necessary to test me.... Our first meeting ended with his instructing me to give him an accurate report on all the activities of the revolutionary émigrés.... On the next occasion Herr Greif introduced me to what he called 'his right hand', namely 'one of his agents', he added. This turned out to be a tall elegantly dressed young man who also gave his name as Mr. Charles. The whole political police seems to have adopted this pseudonym and I now had three Charleses to deal with. The latest specimen seemed to be the most remarkable. He said that 'he too had been a revolutionary but that all things were possible and I had only to go along with him'"</p></blockquote><p>Greif left London for some time and parted from Hirsch</p><blockquote><p>"expressly commending me to the latest Mr. Charles who, he said, acted always on his instructions. I should not hesitate to confide in him. Moreover, even if certain things should appear strange to me I should not be surprised. To make this clearer he added: 'The Ministry sometimes requires various things, <i>chiefly documents; if these are unobtainable we should find some way out!</i>'"</p></blockquote><p>Hirsch states further that the latest Charles was <i>Fleury</i>.</p><blockquote><p>"He had earlier been employed in the office of the <i>Dresdner Zeitung</i>, which was edited by L. Wittig. When he was in Baden, he was, as a result of recommendations he had brought from Saxony, sent by the provisional government to the Palatinate to take in hand the organisation of the Landsturm, etc. When the Prussians occupied Karlsruhe he was taken prisoner, etc. He suddenly reappeared in London towards the end of 1850 or early in 1851; from the outset he went here by the name of de Fleury and was known by this name in refugee circles. He was hard up, at least he seemed to be, stayed in the refugee barracks set up by the Refugee Committee and drew subsidies. Early in the summer of 1851 his position suddenly improved; he moved into a respectable apartment and at the end of the year he married the daughter of an English engineer. He turned up later in Paris as a police agent.... His real name is <i>Krause</i> and he is the son of Krause the cobbler who was executed some 15 or 18 years ago in Dresden together with Backhof and Beseler for the murder of Countess Schönberg and her maid.... Fleury-Krause told me many times that he had been working for different governments since he was 14."</p></blockquote><p>It is this same <i>Fleury-Krause</i> whom Stieber admitted in open court in Cologne to be a secret Prussian police agent working directly under Greif. In my <i>Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne</i> I wrote of Fleury:</p>
<p>"Fleury is not indeed the Fleur de Marie of the police prostitutes, but he is a flower<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49" id="cite_ref-49">[49]</a></sup> and he will bear blossom, albeit only fleurs-de-lys."<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50" id="cite_ref-50">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>
This prophecy has in a sense been fulfilled; some months after the communist trial Fleury was sentenced in England to several years in the hulks<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51" id="cite_ref-51">[51]</a></sup> for forgery.</p><blockquote><p>"As the right-hand man of Police Lieutenant Greif," Hirsch writes, "Fleury dealt directly with the Prussian Embassy during Greif's absence."</p></blockquote><p>Fleury was in contact with Max Reuter who stole the letters. from Oswald Dietz, that time archivist of the Schapper-Willich League.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-52" id="cite_ref-52">[52]</a></sup> </p><blockquote><p>"Stieber," says Hirsch, "had learned from the agent of the Prussian Ambassador in Paris Hatzfeldt, the notorious <i>Cherval</i>, of the letters written by the latter to London. Stieber got Reuter to find out where they were, whereupon Fleury stole them on Stieber's orders and with Reuter's aid. These are the stolen letters which Herr Stieber was not ashamed to exhibit <i>'as such'</i> to the jury in Cologne.... In autumn 1851 Fleury had been in Paris with Greif and Stieber after the latter had, through the mediation of Count Hatzfeldt, made contact with <i>Cherval</i>, or more correctly, <i>Joseph Crämer</i> with whose assistance he hoped to engineer a plot. With this end in view consultations were held in Paris between Messrs. Stieber, Greif, Fleury, two other police agents, Beckmann<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53" id="cite_ref-53">[53]</a></sup> and Sommer, and the famous French spy <i>Lucien de la Hodde</i> (who went by the name of Duprez) and they gave Cherval directions according to which he was to tailor his correspondence. Fleury often laughed in my presence over the scuffle he had provoked between Stieber and Cherval. And the man called Schmidt who in the guise of secretary of a revolutionary league in Strasbourg and Cologne had gained admission to the society founded at <i>the behest of the police</i> by Cherval, was none other than M. de Fleury.... Fleury was undoubtedly the sole agent of the Prussian secret police in London and all proposals and offers that the Embassy received went through his hands.... Messrs. Greif and Stieber were accustomed to relying on his judgment."</p></blockquote><p>Fleury informed Hirsch:</p><blockquote><p>"Herr Greif has told you what has to be done.... At Police Headquarters in Frankfurt they are themselves of the opinion that our primary aim must be to make <i>the position of the political police secure</i>; the means we use to achieve this are immaterial; the September Plot in Paris is already <i>one step in this direction</i>."<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54" id="cite_ref-54">[54]</a></sup> </p></blockquote><p>Greif returned to London and expressed satisfaction with Hirsch's work but demanded more. In particular he wanted reports on <i>"the secret meetings of Marx party"</i>.</p>
<p>"At all costs," the Police Lieutenant concluded, "we must draw up reports on the League meetings. Do it any way you wish as long as you don't overstep the limits of credibility. I am too <i>occupied</i> to attend to it myself. M. de Fleury will work with you as my representative."</p>
<p>
Greif's occupation at that time consisted, as Hirsch states, in a correspondence via de la Hodde-Duprez with Maupas concerning the arrangements for the mock escape of Cherval and Gipperich from the St. Pélagie gaol. On being assured by Hirsch that</p><blockquote><p>"Marx had not founded any new central organisation of the League in London ... Greif agreed with Fleury that in the circumstances we should for the time being prepare reports on meetings of the League ourselves. He, Greif, would vouch for their authenticity, and in any case his submissions would be accepted".</p></blockquote><p>So Hirsch and Fleury set to work ."The content" of their reports on the secret meetings of the League I held</p><blockquote><p>"was provided", Hirsch states, "by reports of discussions that took place from time to time; the admission of new members, the founding of new sections in obscure corners of Germany, or a new organisation; speculation to the effect that in Cologne Marx's imprisoned friends did or did not have any prospects of being released; letters that had come from this person or that, and so on. On this last point Fleury usually took care to mention people in Germany who had become suspect as a result of political investigations or who had been involved in some political activity or other. Very often, however, we had to have recourse to our imagination and then we would report on the activities of a non-existent member of the League. But Herr Greif said that the reports were excellent and that anyway we had to have them at all costs. Some of the writing was done by Fleury alone but mostly I had to help him as he was unable to describe the smallest detail without errors of style. In this way the reports came into being and without a moment's hesitation Herr Greif declared his willingness to vouch for their authenticity".</p></blockquote><p>Hirsch then describes how Fleury and he visited Arnold Ruge in Brighton, and Eduard Meyen (of Tobian memory) and stole letters and lithographed material from them. Not content with this, Greif-Fleury rented a lithographic press from Stanbury Press, Fetter Lane, and together with Hirsch began to produce "radical pamphlets". That "democrat", <i>F. Zabel</i>, could learn a lesson or two here. Let him take note of this:</p><blockquote><p>"The first pamphlet I" (Hirsch) "wrote was entitled <i>An das Landproletariat</i> at Fleury's suggestion; and we managed to make a few good copies of it. Herr Greif sent these copies as documents emanating from the <i>Marx party</i>. To make it seem more plausible we included in the reports of the so-called League meetings, which came into being in the manner described above, a few words about the dispatch of such a pamphlet. One other product of this kind was fabricated; its title was <i>An die Kinder des Volkes</i> and I do not know under whose auspices Herr Greif sent this one in. We later abandoned this trick chiefly because it was so costly."</p></blockquote><p>At this point Cherval arrived in London after his mock escape from Paris and was attached to Greif at a weekly salary of £1 10s.,</p><blockquote><p>"in return for which he was required to make reports on the contacts between the German and French émigrés".</p></blockquote><p>Publicly exposed and expelled from the Workers' Society as a spy,,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55" id="cite_ref-55">[55]</a></sup> </p><blockquote><p>"Cherval very understandably described the German émigrés and their organs as being as insignificant as could be—since he found it quite impossible to get hold of any information on the subject which he could pass on. By way of compensation he compiled a report for Greif on the non-German revolutionary party which put Munchausen's tall stories in the shade".</p></blockquote><p>Hirsch now returns to the Cologne trial.</p><blockquote><p>"Herr Greif had already been questioned a number of times about the contents of the League reports prepared at his instance by Fleury in so far as they had any bearing on the Cologne trial.... There were also particular commissions in connection with the trial. On one occasion Marx was alleged to be corresponding with <i>Lassalle</i> via an 'ale-house' and the Public Prosecutor required further information.... Rather more naïve was the Public Prosecutor's request asking for precise information about the financial assistance that Lassalle in Düsseldorf was allegedly sending to the defendant Röser in Cologne ... it was believed that the true source of the money was in London."</p></blockquote><p>I have already recounted in Section III, 4 how Fleury, acting on instructions from Hinckeldey, was to find someone in London who would be willing to appear before the jury in Cologne in the guise of H.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56" id="cite_ref-56">[56]</a></sup> the witness who had disappeared, etc. After a detailed account of this incident Hirsch goes on:</p><blockquote><p>"Herr Stieber had meanwhile urgently requested Greif to supply him, if at all possible, with the original minutes of the League meetings that he had been reporting on. Fleury was of the opinion that he could produce an original minute-book if only the requisite people were available. Above all, however, he would need <i>specimens of the handwriting of some of Marx's friends</i>. I made use of this last remark in order to extricate myself from the whole undertaking; Fleury alluded to the topic only once again and after that he said nothing more. Around this time Stieber suddenly appeared in Cologne with a Minute-Book of the League's central organisation in London.... I was even more astonished when I found that the minutes as reported in extract in the papers were absolutely identical with the reports concocted by Fleury at Greif's behest. It was evident that Herr Greif or Herr Stieber himself had had a <i>copy</i> made somehow or other, <i>for the minutes in this allegedly original document bore signatures while those submitted by Fleury had none</i>. From Fleury himself I learned about this miracle only that 'Stieber can contrive anything, it will be a sensation!'"</p></blockquote><p>As soon as Fleury heard that "Marx" had had the handwriting of the ostensible signatories of the minutes (Liebknecht, Rings, Ulmer, etc.) witnessed in a London Police Court<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57" id="cite_ref-57">[57]</a></sup> he wrote the following letter:</p><blockquote><p>"<i>To the Royal Police Presidium in Berlin</i>; dated from London.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"It is the intention of Marx and his friends here to discredit the signatures on the League Minutes by having handwriting specimens legally authenticated. These specimens are to be produced in the Court of Assizes as the really authentic ones. Everyone familiar with the English laws knows that on this point they can be manipulated and that a person who vouches for the authenticity of a thing does not actually give any true guarantee. The person who gives you this information does not recoil from giving you his name in a matter like this where the truth is at stake. <i>Becker</i>, 4, Litchfield St." "Fleury knew the address of Becker, a German refugee living in the same house as <i>Willich</i>. It might very easily happen later on that the suspicion of authorship would fall on the latter who was an opponent of Marx.... Fleury looked forward eagerly to the scandal that would result. The letter would be read out in court, but of course too late, he thought, for any doubts about its authenticity to arise before the trial was over.... The letter, signed by Becker, was addressed to the <i>Police Presidium in Berlin</i>, however it went not to Berlin but to 'Police Officer Goldheim, Frankfurter Hof in Cologne', and an <i>envelope for this letter</i> arrived at the Police Presidium in Berlin with a note stating that '<i>Herr Stieber in Cologne would give a complete explanation as to its use...</i>.' Stieber made no use of this letter; he was unable to do so because he was forced to drop the whole <i>Minute-Book</i>"</p></blockquote><p>With regard to the Minute-Book Hirsch says that</p><blockquote><p>"Herr Stieber declared" (in court) "that he had had the Minute-Book in his hands for two weeks but had scrupled to produce it; he declared further that it had come to him by a courier called Greif.... Hence Greif had personally delivered his own work. How can this be reconciled with a letter of Herr <i>Goldheim</i>'s in which he informed the Embassy that 'the Minute-Book was produced so late only in order to avoid scrutiny as to its authenticity....'"</p></blockquote><p>On Friday, October 29, Herr Goldheim arrived in London.</p><blockquote><p>"As Herr Stieber had to face the fact that it was not possible to uphold the authenticity of the Minute-Book he sent a deputy to negotiate with Fleury about it on the spot. At issue was the question whether a proof could not be obtained after all. His discussions were fruitless and he returned without any decision having been reached. Fleury was left in a state of despair for Stieber was now resolved to expose him rather than compromise the police chiefs. But I did not realise that this was the cause of Fleury's disquiet until Herr Stieber made his declaration soon afterwards. In panic, M. Fleury now resorted to his last expedient. He brought me a specimen of handwriting for me to use to copy out a declaration, sign it 'Liebknecht' and take an oath before the Lord Mayor of London that I was Liebknecht.... Fleury told me that the handwriting was that of the person who had written the Minute-Book and that <i>Herr Goldheim had brought it with him</i>" (<i>from Cologne</i>). "But if Herr Stieber had received the Minute-Book per Greif, the courier from London, how was it possible for Herr Goldheim to bring a specimen of the handwriting of the alleged Minute-Book writer from Cologne at the very moment when Greif had just arrived back in London?.... What Fleury gave me consisted of a few phrases and a signature...." Hirsch "copied the handwriting as closely as he could and wrote that the undersigned, i.e. Liebknecht, declared that the signature of Liebknecht legally witnessed by Marx and Co. was false and that this, his signature was the only genuine one. When I had finished and had the handwriting in my hands" (i.e. the specimen given him by Fleury to copy), "which, fortunately I still possess, I told Fleury, who was not a little taken aback, that I had had second thoughts and would not go through with it. Inconsolable at first, he then announced that he would swear to it himself.... For safety's sake he would <i>have the writing countersigned by the Prussian Consul</i>; and he went to the Consulate at once. I waited for him in a tavern; when he got back he had the countersignature and he next went to the Lord Mayor to swear the oath. But the plan fell through as the Lord Mayor wanted further guarantees and Fleury could not give them—so the oath remained unsworn.... Late in the evening I saw M. de Fleury again, and for the last time. That very day he had been unpleasantly surprised to read Herr Stieber's declaration concerning him in the <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i>. 'But I know that Stieber could not have acted differently, otherwise he would have had to compromise himself,' M. de Fleury said very truly by way of consoling himself.... '<i>There will be a great explosion in Berlin if the Cologne prisoners are convicted</i>,' M. de Fleury said to me at one of our last meetings".</p></blockquote><p>Fleury's last meetings with Hirsch took place at the <i>end of October 1852</i>. Hirsch's confessions are dated the <i>end of November 1852</i>; and at the <i>end of March 1853</i> came the "<i>explosion in Berlin</i>" (the Ladendorf conspiracy).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58" id="cite_ref-58">[58]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-59" id="cite_ref-59">[59]</a></sup> </p><h2 class="mw-headline" id="ME17-24-6">5.

<p>When the communist trial in Cologne was over, Vogt-like calumnies about my "exploitation" of the workers were busily disseminated, especially in the German-American press. Some of my friends living in America—Messrs. J. Weydemeyer, Dr. A. Jacoby (a practising doctor in New York and one of the defendants in the Cologne communist trial) and A. Cluss (an official in the U.S. Navy Yard in Washington)—published a detailed refutation of these absurdities dated New York, November 7, 1853. Their article contained the comment that I was in the right to preserve <i>silence</i> about my private affairs insofar as it was a matter of gaining the <i>approval</i> of the philistines. "But when faced by the <i>hostility</i> of the mob, the philistines and the degenerate idlers, it does harm to the cause in our view and so <i>we</i> break that silence."<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-60" id="cite_ref-60">[60]</a></sup> </p>
<h2 class="mw-headline" id="ME17-24-7">6. The War Between Frogs and Mice</h2>
<p>In my pamphlet <i>The Knight, etc.</i>, from which I quoted above, I wrote on p. 5:</p>
<p>
"...On July 20, 1851 the 'Agitation Union' was founded, and on July 27, 1851 the German 'Émigré Club'. From that day ... dates the struggle on both sides of the ocean between the 'Émigrés' and the 'Agitators', the great war between frogs and mice.</p><blockquote><p>Now who will give me words and who the tongue,</p>

<p>For ne'er was strife upon this earth begun</p>
<p>More proudly fought on bloodier battle grounds;</p>
<p>Compared to this all other wars are roses.</p>
<p>To tell of it my lyric art confounds</p>
<p>For on this earth there ne'er was seen such glory</p>
<p>
Or noble valour bright as in this story.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>(After Boiardo, <i>Orlando innamorato</i>, Canto 27.)""<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61" id="cite_ref-61">[61]</a></sup> </p></blockquote><p>Now it is by no means my intention to go into the details of "the story" of this strife or into the agreement entitled, <i>verbotenus</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62" id="cite_ref-62">[62]</a></sup>The Preliminary Agreement about the <i>Treaty on the Alliance</i>" (under which name it was publicised throughout the entire German-American press), which was reached between <i>Gottfried Kinkel</i> in the name of the Émigré Club, and <i>A. Goegg</i> on behalf of the "Revolutionary League of the Two Worlds", on August 13, 1852. I would only remark that with a few exceptions the entire <i>parliamentary</i> emigration joined in the farce on one side or the other. (Of course, names like <i>K. Vogt</i> were at that time avoided by every party if only for propriety's sake.)</p>
<p>At the end of his revolutionary pleasure and fund-raising tour of the United States, Gottfried Kinkel, the passion flower of German philistinism, wrote a "<i>Denkschrift über das deutsche Nationalanlehn zur Förderung der Revolution</i>", dated Elmira, N. Y., February 22, 1852, in which he gave vent to views which at least possess the merit of great simplicity. Gottfried believes that engineering a revolution is much like making a railway. Once the money is there, the railway, or the revolution will follow in due course. Whereas the nation should cherish a longing for revolution in its heart, the makers of revolution should have cash in their pockets, and everything therefore depends on "a small well-equipped band of men with a <b>plentiful</b> supply of money". It is remarkable into what bizarre byways of thought even melodramatic minds are driven by England's commercial wind. Since everything here, even public opinion,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63" id="cite_ref-63">[63]</a></sup> is organised with the aid of shares, why not float a joint-stock company "for the promotion of the revolution"?</p>
<p>
In a public meeting with <i>Kossuth</i>, who was also engaged at that time on a revolutionary fund-raising campaign in the United States, <i>Gottfried</i> expressed himself in highly aesthetic terms:</p><blockquote><p>"Even from your clean hands, Governor, the gift of freedom would be a bitter pill, and I would moisten it <i>with the tears of <b>my shame</b></i>.",<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64" id="cite_ref-64">[64]</a></sup> </p></blockquote><p>Hence <i>Gottfried</i>, having looked the gift-horse so sharply in the mouth, assured the governor that if the latter should present to him "the revolution in the east" with his right hand, he, Gottfried, would present to him "the revolution in the west" in return. Seven years later, in the <i>Hermann</i>, a paper he had founded himself, the very same Gottfried assured his readers that he was a man of rare consistency<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65" id="cite_ref-65">[65]</a></sup> and that having proclaimed the Prince Regent,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66" id="cite_ref-66">[66]</a></sup> as Emperor of Germany before the military court in Rastatt<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67" id="cite_ref-67">[67]</a></sup> he had always kept this as his motto.
Count Oskar Reichenbach, one of the three original regents and the Treasurer of the Revolutionary Loan, published the accounts in <i>London</i> on <i>October 8, 1852</i>, together with a statement in which he dissociated himself from the enterprise. At the same time he declared that "in any event I neither can nor will hand the money over to citizens Kinkel, etc." Instead he invited the shareholders to hand in their provisional loan certificates in exchange for the money in his hands. His own resignation as treasurer, etc., he said,</p><blockquote><p>"was motivated by political and legal considerations.... The assumptions on which the idea of the loan was based have not been realised. The sum of 20,000 dollars which had to be raised before the loan could be proceeded with, has therefore not been acquired.... The proposal to found a periodical and to promote agitation found no echo. Only political charlatans or revolutionary monomaniacs could deem the loan to be practicable at present and imagine that an equitable, and hence impersonal, actively revolutionary use of the money by all party groups is possible at this moment."</p></blockquote><p>But Gottfried's faith in revolution could not be shaken so easily and so he procured a "resolution" that allowed him to carry on the business under another name.
Reichenbach's statement of the accounts contains some interesting data.</p><blockquote><p>"The Trustees," he says, "cannot be held responsible for contributions which may have been made later by the committees <i>to persons other than myself</i>, and I would ask the committees to take note of this when calling in the certificates and settling accounts."</p></blockquote><p>According to his computations £1,587 6s. 4d. was <i>received</i>, of which London, had contributed £2 5s., and "<i>Germany</i>" £9. The <i>expenditure</i> amounted to £584 18s. 5d. and was broken down as follows: <i>Kinkel's</i> and <i>Hillgärtner's travel expenses</i>: £220; <i>other travel expenses</i>: £54; lithographic press: £11; cost of provisional certificates: £14; <i>lithographed correspondence, stamps, etc.</i>: £106 1s. 6d. <i>On Kinkel's instructions, etc.</i>: £100.</p>
<p>The Revolutionary Loan ended up with £1,000, which Gottfried Kinkel keeps in the Westminster Bank as earnest money for the first German provisional government. And despite all this, there is still no provisional 'government. Perhaps Germany believes that 36 actual governments are quite sufficient.</p>
<p>Certain American loan funds which were not incorporated into the central London Treasury were at least employed here and there for patriotic purposes. Such was the case with the £100 which Gottfried Kinkel gave to Karl Blind early in 1858 to transform into "radical pamphlets", etc.

<h2 class="mw-headline" id="ME17-24-9">8. Statement by Herr A. Scherzer</h2><p>
Herr <i>A. Scherzer</i>, a man who has played a praiseworthy role in the workers' movement since the 1830s, wrote to me from London on April 22, 1860:</p><blockquote><p>"Dear Citizen,
"I cannot let the occasion pass without protesting about a passage in the monstrous tissue of lies and the infamous calumnies of Vogt's pamphlet which concerns me personally. I am referring to the statement in Document No. 7, printed in the supplement to the <i>Schweizer Handels-Courier</i>, No. 150, of June 2, where it says: 'We know that at this very time fresh efforts are being made from London. Letters signed by A. Sch... are being sent from there to both associations and individuals, etc.' These 'letters' appear to be the reason why Herr K. Vogt wrote elsewhere in his book: 'At the beginning of this year (1859) a new arena for political agitation seemed to be opening up. The opportunity was seized in a moment so as to regain some influence if possible. The tactics have not altered in this respect for years. A committee about which "no-one knows nothing", as it says in the old song, circulates letters through an equally unknown president or secretary, etc., etc. Having reconnoitred the terrain in this manner, a number of "travelling brethren" turn up in the country and at once start to organise a secret league. The association which is to be compromised learns nothing of these goings-on which remain the work of a number of sectarian individuals. For the most part even the correspondence conducted in the name of the association remains quite unknown to it, but the letters refer always to "our association", etc., and the inquiries of the police, which follow inexorably, and are based on documents that have fallen into their hands, always affect the association as a whole, etc.'</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"Why did Herr K. Vogt not <i>print the whole letter</i> which he alludes to in Document No. 7? Why not 'reconnoitre' the source he has relied on for his information? It would have been easy for him to discover that the public <i>Workers' Educational Society in London</i> chose its correspondence committee, to which I had the honour to be elected, in <i>open</i> session. When Herr Vogt speaks of unknown secretaries and the like, I am very pleased to be unknown to him, but am happy to be able to say that I am known to thousands of German workers, who have all derived benefit from the erudition of the men whom he vilifies now. Times have changed. The period of secret societies is past. It is ridiculous to talk of secret leagues or sects, when problems are dealt with openly in a workers' society, where strangers attend as visitors at every meeting. The letters signed by me were so formulated that it was impossible for anyone to come to harm in consequence. We German workers in London had only one interest at heart and that was to learn about the mood of the workers' associations on the Continent, and to found a newspaper which would represent the interests of the working class and which would do battle with writers in the pay of the enemy. It naturally did not occur to a single German worker to act in the interests of a Bonaparte, a thing of which only a Vogt or people of his kind are capable. We undoubtedly hate the despotism of Austria with a far deeper loathing than Herr Vogt, but we do not seek its defeat in the victory of another despot. Every people must liberate itself. Is it not striking that Herr Vogt arrogates for himself the very means which he accuses us of having used against his own activities? Herr Vogt asserts that he is not in the pay of Bonaparte, and that he only received money to set up a newspaper from democratic sources. In saying this he hopes to exonerate himself, but how can he be so obtuse, with all his learning, to cast suspicion on workers, and hurl accusations at them for concerning themselves with the well-being of their country and for making propaganda about the need to establish a newspaper?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"With my most sincere respects, <i>A. Scherzer</i>"</p></blockquote>

May I ask you urgently to send it to us as quickly as possible, so that we can produce it in court. Please, send the document against a receipt and charge us for any expenses you may have incurred. Incidentally, my dear Sir, the liberal party sometimes misjudges the <i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i>. We (the editors) have gone through fire and water and have passed all the tests of political commitment. If you do not consider the separate piece of work, the individual article, but our whole activity you will probably come to realise that no German newspaper strives as we do, without haste, but without rest, for unity and freedom, power and culture, for spiritual and material progress, for greater patriotic awareness and higher moral standards of the German nation, and that no paper achieves more than ours. You should judge our deeds by their effects.

<p>"Now, before taking any further step, I want to show up the fellows who evidently have played into the hands of Vogt. I, therefore, publicly declare that the statement of Blind, Wiehe and Hollinger, according to which the anonymous pamphlet was <i>not</i> printed in Hollinger's office, 3, Litchfield Street, Soho, is a <i>deliberate lie</i>. First, Mr. Vögele, one of the compositors, formerly employed by Hollinger, will declare upon oath that the said pamphlet <i>was</i> printed in Hollinger's office, was written in the hand-writing of <i>Mr. Blind</i>, and partly composed by Hollinger himself. Secondly, it can be judicially proved that the pamphlet and the article in <i>Das Volk</i> have been taken off the same types. Thirdly, it will be shown that Wiehe was <i>not</i> employed by Hollinger for eleven consecutive months, and, especially, was <i>not</i> employed by him at the time of the pamphlet's publication. Lastly, witnesses may be summoned in whose presence Wiehe himself confessed having been persuaded by Hollinger to sign the <i>wilfully false declaration in the Augsburg Gazette</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-72" id="cite_ref-72">[72]</a></sup> Consequently, I again declare the above said <i>Charles Blind</i> to be a <i>deliberate liar</i>.

He presented to me a paper to the effect, that, during the preceding eleven months I had been continuously employed by him, and that during all that time a certain German flysheet <i>Zur Warnung</i> (A Warning) had not been composed and printed in Mr. Hollinger's Office, 3, Litchfield Street, Soho. In my perplexed state, and not aware of the importance of the transaction, I complied with his wish, and copied, and signed the document. Mr. Hollinger promised me money, but I never received anything. During that transaction Mr. Charles Blind, as my wife informed me at the time, was waiting in Mr. Hollinger's room. A few days later, Mrs. Hollinger called me down from dinner and led me into her husband's room, where I found Mr. Charles Blind alone. He presented me the same paper which Mr. Hollinger had presented me before, and entreated me to write, and sign a second copy, as he wanted two, the one for himself, and the other for publication in the Press.

I myself broke them into columns for the reprint of the flysheet (or pamphlet) <i>Zur Warnung</i> (A Warning) in the German paper <i>Das Volk</i> published at London, by Mr. Fidelio Hollinger, 3, Litchfield Street, Soho. The flysheet appeared in No. 7, d. d. 18th June 1859, of <i>Das Volk</i> (The People). 5) I saw Mr. Hollinger give to Mr. William Liebknecht of 14, Church Street, Soho, London, the proofsheet of the pamphlet <i>Zur Warnung</i>, on which proofsheet Mr. Charles Blind with his own hand had corrected four or five mistakes.

<h3 class="mw-headline" id="ME17-24-18">a) K. Vogt and <i>La Cimentaire</i></h3><a id="a)_K._Vogt_and_La_Cimentaire"></a><p>
While the last of these pages were being printed, I accidentally came across the <i>October issue</i> (1860) of the <i>Stimmen der Zeit. A. Kolatschek</i>, the former publisher of the <i>Deutsche Monatsschrift</i>, the organ of the refugee parliamentarians, and hence, in a manner of speaking, the literary superior of the "fugitive Regent of the Empire", tells the following story about his <i>friend Karl Vogt</i> on p. 37:</p><blockquote><p>"The Geneva joint-stock company, <i>La Cimentaire</i>, which numbered none other than Herr <i>Karl Vogt</i> himself among its <i>directors</i>, was founded in 1857. By 1858 the shareholders were down to their last farthing and the public prosecutor immediately put one of the directors in gaol on charges of fraud. At the time of the arrest Herr Vogt happened to be away in Berne; he returned in haste, the man who had been arrested was set at liberty, the charges were suppressed 'for fear of causing a scandal', but the shareholders lost everything. But after such an example as this it cannot really be maintained that property is very well protected in Geneva and the error of Herr <i>Karl Vogt</i> in this respect is all the stranger since he was, as we have mentioned, <i>one of the directors of the company concerned</i>. And even in France in similar cases it is customary to search for the culprits among the directors, to put them into gaol and to use their property to satisfy the civil claims of the shareholders."</p></blockquote><p>This should be compared with the account given by Joh. Ph. Becker in his letter (in Chapter X) about the bank incident which drove <i>M. James Fazy</i> into the arms of the Decembrists. Such details as this are a great help in solving the riddle of how "<i>Napoléon le Petit</i>" became the greatest man of his age. As is well known "<i>Napoléon le Petit</i>" himself had to choose between a coup d'état and—Clichy.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-90" id="cite_ref-90">[90]</a></sup> </p><h3 class="mw-headline" id="ME17-24-19">b) Kossuth</h3><a id="b)_Kossuth"></a><p>
The following excerpt from a memorandum of a conversation with <i>Kossuth</i> proves incontrovertibly that Kossuth knows perfectly well that it is <i>Russia</i> that constitutes the greatest threat to Hungary. The memorandum<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-91" id="cite_ref-91">[91]</a></sup> comes from one of the most celebrated radical members<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-92" id="cite_ref-92">[92]</a></sup> of the present House of Commons.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-93" id="cite_ref-93">[93]</a></sup> </p><blockquote><p>"<i>Memorandum of a conversation with M. Kossuth on the evening of May 30th, 1854</i>, at....</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"... A return to strict legality in Hungary (said he, viz. <i>Kossuth</i>) might renew the union of Hungary and Austria, and <i>would prevent Russia from finding any partisan in Hungary</i>. He (Kossuth) would not offer any opposition to a return to legality. He would advise his countrymen to accept with good faith such a restoration, if it could be obtained, and would pledge himself not in any way to be an obstacle to such an arrangement. He would not himself return to Hungary. He would not him-self put forward such a course for Austria as he had no belief in Austria's return to legality, except under pressure of dire necessity. He gave me authority to say, such were his sentiments, and if appealed to, he would avow them, though he could not commit himself to any proposal, as he could not expect Austria to abandon her traditional scheme of centralisation till forced to do so.... He would have consented in 1848 to Hungarian troops being sent to resist attacks of the Piedmontese" (M. Kossuth went much further in 1848 since he ensured that Hungarian troops would be sent against the Italian "rebels" by delivering a violent speech in the Imperial Diet in Pest), "but would not employ them to coerce Austrian Italy, as he would not consent to foreign troops in Hungary."<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-94" id="cite_ref-94">[94]</a></sup> </p></blockquote><p>The mythopoeic power of popular fantasy has always shown itself in the creation of "great men". <i>Simon Bolivar</i> is undeniably the most convincing illustration of this. As for <i>Kossuth</i>, he is, for example, celebrated as the man who abolished feudalism in Hungary. Nevertheless he is in no way connected with the three great measures: universal taxation, the abolition of the feudal burden of the peasantry and the abolition without compensation of the tithes paid to the Church. The motion for <i>universal taxation</i> (the nobility having previously been exempt) was put by <i>Szemere</i>; the motion to do away with corvée, etc., by <i>Bonis</i>, the deputy for Szabolcz, and the clergy itself, acting through Jekelfalussy, a deputy and a canon, voluntarily relinquished its rights to raise tithes.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-95" id="cite_ref-95">[95]</a></sup> </p><h3 class="mw-headline" id="ME17-24-20">c) Edmond About's <i>La Prusse en 1860</i></h3><a id="c)_Edmond_About's_La_Prusse_en_1860"></a>
<p>At the end of Chapter VIII I expressed the opinion that <i>E. About</i>'s pamphlet <i>La Prusse en 1860</i>, or as it was originally called, <i>Napoléon III et la Prusse</i>, was a retranslation into French of an excerpt of Dâ-Dâ Vogt's German compilation of the Dentu pamphlets. The only objection to this view was the total ignorance of the German language on the part of that unsuccessful comedy writer, E. About. But was it out of the question for the <i>compère Guillery</i> to have discovered a <i>commère allemande</i>;<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-96" id="cite_ref-96">[96]</a></sup> somewhere or other in Paris? Who this <i>commère</i> was remained a matter of conjecture. <i>La Prusse en 1860</i> was known to have been published as a vademecum for Louis Bonaparte's trip to Baden-Baden<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-97" id="cite_ref-97">[97]</a></sup> it was designed to foreshadow his request to the Prince Regent and to make it clear to Prussia that in the December 2 Empire Prussia possessed, in the concluding words of the pamphlet, an "allié très utile qui est peut-être appelé à lui" (Prussia) "rendre de grands services, <i>pourvu qu'elle s'y prête un peu</i>".<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-98" id="cite_ref-98">[98]</a></sup> E. About had already revealed in French (see Chapter IX, "Agency") in <i>L'Opinion Nationale</i> as early as the spring of 1860 that "<i>pourvu qu'elle s'y prête un peu</i>" translated into German means: "on the condition that Prussia sells the Rhine Province to France". In view of these aggravating circumstances I could not name anyone as the German prompter of E. About, the unsuccessful comedy writer and Dentu pamphletist, simply on the basis of a conjecture. But I am now justified in declaring that the German <i>commère</i> of the <i>compère</i> Guillery is none other than Vogt's gentle Kunigunde—<i>Herr Ludwig Simon of Trier</i>. This was hardly suspected by the German refugee in London<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-99" id="cite_ref-99">[99]</a></sup> who penned the well-known answer to About's pamphlet.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-100" id="cite_ref-100">[100]</a></sup> </p>

In view of the factionalists' refusal to abide by the decision to transfer the Central Authority to Cologne and because of their disorganising activities, the Cologne Central Authority expelled them from the League at the proposal of the League's London District and gave notification of this in its Address of December 1, 1850 (see <a href="MECW10-072.html">Meeting of the Central Authority, September 15, 1850</a> and <a href="MECW10-075.html">Proposal from the London District of the Communist League to the Central Authority in Cologne</a>).

The petty-bourgeois conspiratorial tactics of the group, ignoring realities and aiming at an immediate uprising, enabled the French and Prussian police, with the help of the agent-provocateur Cherval, who headed one of the group's local communities in Paris, to fabricate the case of the so-called Franco-German plot. Cherval was both an agent of the Prussian envoy in Paris and a French spy. In February 1852 the accused were sentenced on a charge of plotting a coup d'état. With the connivance of the French and Prussian police Cherval was allowed to escape from prison. The attempts of the Prussian police to incriminate the Communist League led by Marx and Engels failed. Konrad Schramm, a League, member, arrested in Paris in September 1851, was soon released owing to lack of evidence. Nevertheless, the Prussian Police Superintendent Stieber, one of the organisers of the Cologne Communist trial in 1852, repeated the false police accusations. Marx exposed Stieber's perjury in his <i><a href="MECW11-025.html">Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne</a></i> (see the chapter "The Cherval Plot").<br>On his arrival in London in May 1852 Cherval was admitted to the German Workers' Educational Society led by Schapper but was soon expelled because of his role of provocateur in the so-called Franco-German plot.</span>

<li id="cite_note-58"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-58">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The reader will be interested to see the testimonials that Stieber himself gave his two accomplices Fleury-Krause and Hirsch. He writes of the first in the <i>Black Book</i>,[This refers to the book <i>Die Communisten-Verschworungen des neunzehnten jahrhunderts</i>, Berlin, Erster Theil 1853, Zweiter Theil 1854, compiled by the police officers Wermuth and Stieber. The appendices to the first volume, a "history" of the working-class movement written for the information of the police, contained some documents of the Communist League. The second volume was a blacklist of persons associated with the working-class and democratic movement, complete with biographical data.] II, p. 69:<br>"No. 345. <i>Krause</i>, Carl Friedrich August, from Dresden. He is the son of Friedrich August Krause, a farmer executed for his part in the murder of Countess Schönberg in Dresden in 1834, and afterwards" (after his execution?) "a corn-dealer, and of his widow Johanna Rosine née Göllnitz, who is still living. Carl Friedrich was born on January 9, 1824, in the vineyard houses at Coswig near Dresden. From October 1, 1832, he went to the charity school in Dresden; in 1836 he was admitted to the orphanage in Antonstadt, Dresden, and in 1840 he was confirmed. He was then apprenticed to Herr Gruhle, a Dresden merchant, but in the following year he was arrested and detained by the Dresden Municipal Court for <i>repeated theft</i>. However, the period of detention was counted towards his sentence and he was released. After this he lived with his mother without taking a job, but in March 1842 he was arrested again for <i>breaking and entering</i> and this time he was sentenced to <i>four years' imprisonment</i>. On October 23, 1846, he came out of gaol and returned to Dresden and began to <i>associate with the most notorious thieves</i>. Then, the Rehabilitation Society took him up and found him a job in a cigar factory and he remained in this job without interruption or any further misdemeanour until March 1848. But after that date he gave in to his idleness again and began to frequent political societies" (as a government spy; see above his admission to Hirsch in London). "Early in 1849 he became a salesman of the <i>Dresdner Zeitung</i> edited by the republican literateur E. L. Wittig who is now in America but who at that time was in Dresden. In May 1849 he took part in the Dresden uprising and became commandant of the barricade in the Sophienstrasse. He fled to Baden after the uprising was quelled and there he was empowered by the provisional government of Baden (the decrees of June 10 and 23, 1849) to raise a Landsturm and requisition supplies for the insurgents. He was taken prisoner by Prussian soldiers but on October 8, 1849, he escaped from Rastatt." (Just as, later on, Cherval "escaped" from Paris. But now comes the part of the bouquet which has the authentic police aroma—it should be borne in mind that this was printed two years after the Cologne Trial.) "According to a report in the Berlin <i>Publizist</i>, No. 39, of May 15, 1853, taken from a book printed in New York with the title <i>Die Opfer der Spionage</i> [<i>Die Opfer der Moucharderie, Rechtfertigungsschrift von Wilhelm Hirsch.—Ed</i>.] by Wilhelm Hirsch, a Hamburg shop-assistant" (0 Stieber, you foreboding angel!), "Krause turned up in London late in 1850 or early in 1851 as a political emigre bearing the name of <i>Charles de Fleury</i>. At first he lived in somewhat straitened circumstances but later, in 1851, his position improved. For after he was admitted to the Communist League" (another Stieber lie), "he worked as an agent for a number of governments in the course of which, however, he became involved in a number of swindles."<br>So much for Stieber's gratitude to his friend Fleury who, moreover (as we noted above), was sentenced to several years' imprisonment in London for forgery just a few months after the Cologne trial.Concerning the worthy Hirsch we can read (op. cit., R. 58):<br>"No. 265. Hirsch, Wilhelm, shop-assistant from Hamburg. It appears that he went to London not as a refugee but of his own accord." (Why this wholly superfluous lie? After all, Goldheim tried to arrest him in Hamburg!) "But once there he associated with refugees and especially with the communist party. He played a double game. On the one hand, he was active on behalf of the revolutionary party, while, on the other, he offered to spy on political criminals and forgers for a number of continental governments. But he himself became implicated in the <i>worst possible frauds</i> and swindles. In particular, he was guilty of <i>forgery</i>, so that everyone should be on their guard <i>against him</i>. Together with various other individuals he even <i>manufactured false paper money</i> merely in order to extract high rewards from the police for uncovering forgeries. He was eventually unmasked by both sides" (namely, both by police forgers and non-police ones?) "and he has now returned from London to Hamburg where he lives in poor circumstances."Thus far Stieber on his London accomplices to whose "truthfulness and reliability" he is never tired of testifying. It is interesting to see how utterly impossible it is for this model Prussian to speak the simple truth. He cannot even restrain himself from smuggling [A pun on the name <i>Stieber</i> and the verb <i>hineinstiebern</i> (to smuggle in, insert).<i>—Ed</i>.] quite purposeless lies into the—true and false—facts taken from the documents. On the testimony of such professional liars—and they are more numerous now than ever—hundreds of people are sent to prison and in this lies what is nowadays called salvation of the state. [This note to Appendix 4 was added by Engels in the 3rd (1885) edition of the <i>Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne</i>.]</span>

Participants in the popular demonstration forced their way into its premises and demanded the formation of a Ministry of Labour and a number of other measures.

It is extremely necessary for this paper to keep us in Belgium informed about the affairs of German democracy, since it is not possible to learn anything definite about this from the <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i>, the Augsburg <i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i> and the other aristocratic German papers which we receive here in Brussels, any more than from our <i>Indépendance Belge</i>, all of whose special reports are written from the standpoint of the interests of our bourgeois aristocracy. Herr Weerth has told me that he is going to join you in Cologne to collaborate on the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> and he has promised me in your name to send me copies of it in exchange for the <i>Débat social</i> which I shall forward to you. I can ask nothing better than to correspond with you about the affairs common to our two nations. It is in the interest of both our countries that Belgians and Germans should become better acquainted with each other, for in France events are about to take place which in a short time will pose problems affecting both our countries. I have just come back from Paris after spending ten days there during which time I did my best to gain an understanding of what is happening in this great metropolis. At the end of my stay I found myself in the midst of the events of May 15. I was even present at the session of the National Assembly during which the people rushed into the Chamber.... As far as I have understood both from seeing the attitude of the people of Paris and from listening to the speeches of the leading statesmen in the French Republic at the present time, a powerful reaction is expected against the events of February last on the part of the bourgeoisie; the events of May 15 will doubtless hasten this reaction. And this will undoubtedly lead in a short time to a new uprising by the people.... France will soon have to have recourse to war. It is for this reason that we ought to consider here and in your country what common action we should take in that event. If to start with the war is directed against Italy we shall have a breathing space; ... but if it is directed against this country from the very beginning I do not yet know what we should do, and we should then be in need of the advice of the Germans.... In the meantime I shall announce the approaching publication of your new paper in the Sunday edition of the <i>Débat social...</i>. I plan to go to London towards the end of June. Should you have occasion to write to any of your friends in London, I would be grateful if you could ask them to receive me kindly."With cordial greetings,<i>L. Jottrand</i>, Lawyer" —Ed.</span>

By professional novelists, song-writers, vaudeville-writers or sextons."If the newspapers mention mysterious meetings between the northern powers or a project to resurrect the Holy Alliance, immediately some amiable person manufacturing fairly literary songs, and even (formerly) passably liberal songs, will run off to the inevitable <i>M. Dentu</i> and supply him, under the resounding title: 'La Coalition', with a lengthy and insipid paraphrase of the articles of M. Grandguillot. If the alliance with England seems sometimes to displease M. Limayrac, a M. Châtelet, knight of the Order of Gregory the Great, and a man who must be a sexton somewhere or other, to judge him by his style, quickly publishes or republishes a long, ridiculous account: <i>Crimes et délits de l'Angleterre contre la France</i>. The author of <i>Compère Guillery</i> (Edmond About) has already deemed it expedient to edify us with stories about the political secrets of the Prussian monarchy and from the heights of his theatrical fiascos he has honoured the Chambers of Berlin with his prudent advice. It has been announced that M. Clairville will soon elucidate the problem of the Isthmus of Panama which has been so thoroughly obscured by M. Belly; and no doubt a few days after the royal conference of October 21 we shall see in the windows of all our bookshops a splendid pink' pamphlet bearing the title: <i>Mémoire sur l'entrevue de Varsovie par le corps de ballet de I'Opéra</i>.<br>"This apparently inexplicable invasion of the political arena by the <i>lesser gods</i> of literature has many causes. We shall only mention one here, but that one is the most palpable and the most indisputable of all."Amidst the almost universal decline of intellect and heart, the gentlemen who have the dreary task of amusing the public are at a loss for the means to astonish and rouse their readers. They continually reproduce the old jokes of their refrains and their anecdotes. They are themselves as depressed, as melancholy and as bored as those whom they undertake to cheer up. This is why out of sheer despair, when they have come to their wits' end, some of them begin to write the memoirs of courtesans, and others diplomatic pamphlets.<br>"Then, one fine morning, an adventurer of the pen who has never sacrificed a single hour of serious study to politics, who does not even have the ghost of a genuine conviction of any sort in his heart, gets out of bed and says to himself: 'I must strike a great blow! Let's see, what shall I do to attract the notice of the general public which instinctively ignores me? Shall I write an article on the Leotard affair or on the Eastern Question? Shall I reveal to an astonished world the secrets of boudoirs which I have never entered, or the mysteries of Russian politics of which I know even less? Shall I melt with emotion in the Voltairean manner about the fate of <i>fallen women</i>, or bewail in Biblical prose the wretched Maronite population persecuted, plundered and slaughtered by Moslem fanaticism? Shall I sing the praises of Mademoiselle Rigolboche or pen an apologia of temporal power? I have it: I shall settle for politics. I shall entertain my public better with kings and emperors than with loose women.' Having said which, our supernumerary of the literary <i>Bohème</i> wades through the <i>Moniteur</i>, hangs around the colonnades of the Stock Exchange for several days, visits a few officials and in the end he knows which way the wind of the town's curiosity is blowing, or the direction of the favour of the Court. He then selects a title capable of capturing a sufficient portion of this wind, whereupon he rests on his laurels. He has now done everything necessary; for these days only two things are needed to make a pamphlet: the title and the relations that may be supposed to exist between the author and 'people in high places'."Is it still necessary, after all this, to speak of the value of the pamphlets which are flooding the market? If one day you pluck up all your courage and try to read them right through to the end you will be appalled by the extraordinary ignorance, the unbearable frivolousness and especially the utter debasement of moral principles that they reveal in their authors. And I am not speaking of the worst of them.... And every year sees the standard sink still lower, every year brings new evidence of intellectual decadence, every year brings a new literary dishonour to add to those which already make us blush. Things have come to such a pass that even the greatest optimists sometimes wonder what the morrow will bring and anxiously ask themselves: Shall we ever be able to escape from all this?"<i>—Ed</i>.</span>

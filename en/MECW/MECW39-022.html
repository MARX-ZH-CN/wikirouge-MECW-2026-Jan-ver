<p><i>To Engels in Manchester</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 18 February [1852], 28 Dean Street, Soho</b></p>
<p>I shall write to you at length on <i>Saturday</i>. Only a few lines today.</p>
<p>I have not yet received the money that was promised me from home and so have not yet been able to hand over your £2 to Pieper, but have told him I have had a few lines from you in which you informed me that I should be receiving money for him from you. I hope I shall be able to pay him before the week is out.</p>
<p>If your time is very much taken up, you would certainly do better to write for Dana than for Jones. The enclosed letter from Weydemeyer<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> will show you even more plainly how essential it is not to interrupt these articles.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> What must be done now is to redouble our attacks in the <i>Tribune</i> on the Frankfurt Left,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> especially when you come to the 'March Association'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> To help you, I am today sending you Bauer's book<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> in which at least a few facts are to be found.</p>
<p><i>I again pray you to send me the issues of the 'Tribune' by return</i>, since Johnson is the only Englishman to whom I can turn when <i>in extremis<b><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> </b></i> — and I hover constantly on the brink. Don't forget it this time!</p>
<p>How is it that Weydemeyer has not received a <i>single one</i> of your articles [<i>England</i>]? You must set an inquiry on foot.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.

Weydemeyer also wrote that on 4 February 1852 Dana published in the New-York Daily Tribune an article by Ludwig Simon (a deputy to the Frankfurt National Assembly), 'Movements of the German Political Exiles', attacking Marx and Engels.-^37, 44 56 The reference is to the former deputies of the Frankfurt National Assembly. The Frankfurt Left—the petty-bourgeois Left wing of the National Assembly which was convened after the March revolution in Germany and opened its session in Frankfurt on 18 May 1848. The main aim of the Assembly was to put an end to the political disunity of Germany and draw up an all-German Constitution. However it failed to take a decisive stand on the basic problems of the 1848-49 German revolution and ceased to exist on 18 June 1849</span>

Fröbel, Simon, Rüge, Vogt and other petty- bourgeois democratic leaders of the associations confined themselves to revolutionary phrase-mongering and displayed indecision and inconsistency in the struggle against counter-revolution, for which Marx and Engels criticised them sharply in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung (see K. Marx, 'The Frankfurt March Association and the Neue Rheinische Zeitung', present edition, Vol. 9)</span>

On 28 March 1849 the Assembly offered the imperial crown to Frederick William IV of Prussia but he refused to accept it from the 'people's representation'</span>

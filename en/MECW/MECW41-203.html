ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 28 February 1862</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Today I am sending you, CARRIAGE PAID, a case containing: 8 bottles of claret, 4 bottles of old, 1846, hock, 2 bottles of sherry. I haven't any port that would suit the circumstances. I trust it will do Jenny good. Poor child! However, I don't imagine that the</p>
<p><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>thing is of any consequence. She has grown a lot and, with care and exercise, will doubtless regain her strength.</p>
<p>I shall get the £2 for Koller<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>off to you tomorrow or on Monday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>This year, I am spending more than my income. The crisis is affecting us badly,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>we have no orders, and, starting from next week, shall be working merely half-time. Nevertheless, I have to get hold of the £50 for Dronke within 4 weeks and next week there's a year's rent to be paid for my lodgings. I'm moving out; this morning that damned Sarah<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>stole the money from my coat pocket. So, don't address <i>anything more</i> to Thorncliffe Grove. I'm living with Mary nearly all the time now so as to spend as little money as possible; unfortunately, I can't dispense with my LODGINGS, otherwise I should move in with her altogether. I haven't got any new lodgings as yet and shall have to go and look for some.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>Write again soon and let me know how things are going. What is the <i>Tribune</i> up to?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Would you like a military article on America for the <i>Presse?</i></p>
<p>The numbers of <i>The Free Press</i> I am short of are October- February 1861/62.</p>
<p>Best wishes to your wife and the girls.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

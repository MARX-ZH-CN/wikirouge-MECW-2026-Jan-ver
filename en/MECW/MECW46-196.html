ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN VENTNOR</p>
<p>[London,] 3 November [1882]</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Postcard received — we were somewhat anxious, not having heard how you felt on the day after your journey.— ALL RIGHT! Encl. letter from Lafargue — so Brissac, Picard and Bouis did after all waver for a moment!</p>
<p>You will have seen that Andrea Costa has been elected in Ravenna and that there was a republican majority in Norway.</p>
<p>Herewith the <i>Egalité</i> and the latest DOINGS of two 'locals' in whom you have always taken an interest.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

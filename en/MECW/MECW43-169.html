ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>Manchester, 7 March 1869
<br>Dear Moor,
<br>The answer<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> for the Russian<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and his retinue is exactly as it should be. Even in their own <i>sommation</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> the fellows do not dare to call upon you to make the programme your own; they simply wish indirectly to induce you to make a theoretical criticism. A stupid Russian trap into which people in this country will surely not fall. Apart from this, the people's retreat is complete, and nothing more could be desired. The about-face by which the fellows are being compelled to allow you to review their forces is very amusing, and will act like a bucket of cold water over their phrase-mongering heads.
<br>As for the <i>Peasant War</i> it must, I believe, be offered first to Meissner for decency's sake; and if he is not interested in printing it as a popular, cheap pamphlet, there will still be time with Eichhoff. You will have to write to him about <i>The 18th Brumaire,</i> which you could do at the same time. If Meissner does not get on with <i>The 18th Brumaire,</i> or is scared, then steps must be taken and the thing given to Eichhoff.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> Otherwise time will be wasted and the opportunity lost.
<br>I discovered a copy of <i>The 18th Brumaire</i> at Charles',<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> and immediately confiscated it. I read it through again and immediately saw that the book must appear <i>in French without delay.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> That will have quite a different effect from just German, and will immediately make you a name amongst the French, which will at once ensure the translation of your book.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> See who you might get to do this and, in any case, take steps along these LINES. Printed in Brussels, it would get to France en masse.
<br>Before the <i>Peasant War</i> is sent off, send me the copy so that I can correct the misprints, see whether a preface, etc., is necessary, or some notes for the philistines. I am not quite sure whether the Spanish Bergenroth is Frau Jung's Bergenroth. I think I heard the latter had gone to America.
<br><i>Ad vocem</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> Oberwinder<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> : did you ever write to the Angerstein who approached us previously?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> The fellow still has some sort of paper in Vienna. It would be good to avoid an unnecessary squabble with Oberwinder; Wilhelm will have to inform us of the relations between these two and what Angerstein, who was also recommended by him, is now doing.
<br>PRIMAGE is unknown to me in exchange rates and exchange practice. In freightage, it is a supplement to the usual freight, i.e., you pay 36s.— per ton freight and 10% PRIMAGE, that means 39s.6d. If you quote me the context, I can probably explain.
<br><i>Courtage</i> for the <i>rembours</i> is also a very sloppily-worded phrase, so the whole passage would be useful here, too. It probably means <i>courtage,</i> i.e., BROKERAGE for calling in from the drawer the sum of a bill that has gone to protest.<sup>8</sup>
<br>The Augsburg <i>[Allgemeine Zeitung]</i> is again full of the information on the International in Geneva. Clossmann appears to have approached Becker.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> Quite useful.
<br>How are things in Basle? Becker has written 3-4 pamphlets about all these things, but apparently never sends any here.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> <br>For a change, Schorlemmer has once again burned his face; a bottle of bromic-phosphorus he was preparing exploded in front of his nose. He looks good, but has otherwise suffered no damage.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

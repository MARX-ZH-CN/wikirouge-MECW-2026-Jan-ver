<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">This statement was written by Marx in Bingen (Hesse) during his last days in Germany. Immediately after the suppression of the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i>, Marx and Engels went to Frankfurt am Main and then to insurgent Baden and the Palatinate. However, they failed in their attempts to convince the Left deputies of the Frankfurt Assembly and members of the provisional governments of Baden and the Palatinate of the need to give the movement an all-German character, to mount a resolute offensive, to bring the Assembly openly to join the uprising, to compel it to call upon the people everywhere to take up arms, set up an energetic executive power and carry out radical agrarian and other reforms. Their bold revolutionary plan was turned down by the representatives of petty-bourgeois democrats. From Bingen, Marx decided to go to France where new revolutionary events were expected, intending to establish closer ties between the German democrats and the revolutionary circles in Paris. For his part, Engels thought it expedient to return to the Palatinate and join personally the forthcoming struggle against the counter-revolutionary troops that were then concentrating. This statement in the press was in reply to the claims of the democratic <i>Westdeutsche Zeitung</i> (which first came out in Cologne on May 25, 1849) to be the successor of the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i>. Its editorial board announced that the subscribers to the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> would receive the <i>Westdeutsche Zeitung</i> instead. The covering letter addressed to the editorial board of the liberal <i>Frankfurter Journal</i> has survived in manuscript form. There are no data about the statement being published in this newspaper, but it was printed in the democratic newspapers of Frankfurt and Cologne</span>

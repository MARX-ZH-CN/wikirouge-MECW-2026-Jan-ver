MARX TO JOSEF VALENTIN WEBER</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 15 January [1862]</p>
<p>Dear Weber,</p>
<p>I have just had some TICKETS from Urquhart for a meeting next Monday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Of the 3 TICKETS enclosed, one is intended for you. You can also take in some friends on it.</p>
<p>Will you please let the Workers' Society<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>have the other' 2 TICKETS. (These will gain admission for as many as wish to go.) At the same time, I should be obliged—since I have not got the Society's address—if you would inform them that I cannot give a lecture 3 8 2 on Monday because of the meeting.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

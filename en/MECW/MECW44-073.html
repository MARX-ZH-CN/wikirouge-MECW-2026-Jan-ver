ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT</p>
<p>IN LEIPZIG</p>
<p>London, 5 April 1871 122 Regent's Park Road, N.W.</p>
<p>Dear Liebknecht,</p>
<p>Could you have the enclosed<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>inserted in the next issue of the <i>Volksstaat?</i> Precisely this STRIKE is one of supreme importance for the International in Belgium.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>I congratulate you on your release.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Best regards.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p>If the German cigar-workers can afford to advance funds to Antwerp, this should be set in train. The Elberfeld Address was received by the GENERAL COUNCIL <i>yesterday</i> to be sent on and has already gone off.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>I have read it.

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Marx and Engels learned about the strike of the cigar-workers in Antwerp from a letter written by Philippe Coenen, an organiser of the International's sections in Belgium and the Netherlands, on 29 March 1871. They immediately took steps to organise international aid for the strikers. At the General Council meeting of 4 April 1871 Engels spoke about the strike and proposed that the Council send letters and delegations to the British trade unions to organise support.<br>In response to the General Council's appeal, money to the Antwerp cigar-workers was sent by a number of British trades unions and by the workers of Brussels, where the cigar-workers walked out in solidarity.<br>The support by the General Council of the Antwerp cigar-workers defending their trade union enabled them to hold out till September 1871 and to push through their demands.</span>

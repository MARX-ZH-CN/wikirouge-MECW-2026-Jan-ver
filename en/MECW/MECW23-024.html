<br>Sir, — In <em>The National Reformer</em> of January 7th, Mr. Charles Bradlaugh says:

<blockquote>
<br>"We only meant to allege that Dr. Marx had, in former times, given information to his own Government."

</blockquote>
<br>I simply declare that this is a calumny, as ridiculous as it is infamous. I call upon Mr. Bradlaugh to publish any fact that could afford him even the slightest pretext for his statement. For his personal tranquility I add that he shall not he "challenged."
<br>I am, Sir, yours obediently,
<br>Karl Marx
<br>January 16th

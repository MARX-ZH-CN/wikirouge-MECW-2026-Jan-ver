<p>Sir, — In <em>The National Reformer</em> of January 7th, Mr. Charles Bradlaugh says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We only meant to allege that Dr. Marx had, in former times, given information to his own Government."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I simply declare that this is a calumny, as ridiculous as it is infamous. I call upon Mr. Bradlaugh to publish any fact that could afford him even the slightest pretext for his statement. For his personal tranquility I add that he shall not he "challenged."</p>
<p>I am, Sir, yours obediently,</p>
<p>Karl Marx</p>
<p>January 16th

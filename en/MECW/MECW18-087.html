<p>These excerpts from <a href="MECW18-077.html" ülow"="">the article "Bülow"</a> in Das Grosse Conversations-Lexicon für die gebildeten Stände, herausgegeben von J. Meyer (Vol. 6, Hildburghausen, 1843, pp. 732-33) served as preparatory material for Marx's short article on Bülow for The New American Cyclopaedia (see this volume, p. 288 and Note 329). In the present edition the text quoted or summarised from the ConversationsLexicon is in small type, with direct quotations in editorial quotation marks. Marx's own remarks and generalisations are in ordinary type (in some cases they contain information taken from other sources to supplement the text of the article). p. 402

<p>in which capacity he took part in the 1793 campaign, soon promoted to major. During the siege and capture of Mainz (1793) he provided brilliant proof of his courage.</p>
<p>In 1806, as lieutenant-colonel, to which rank he was promoted in 1805, he took part in the defence of Thorn under General L'Estocq and at the battle of Waltersdorf found the opportunity to bring himself and his battalion to the fore.</p>
<p>In 1808 he became major-general</p>
<p>and commander of a Pomeranian brigade which he had been given temporarily at the beginning of the year as colonel. 1811 he was posted to the West Prussian brigade at Marienwerder and at the outbreak of the Franco-Russian war<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> he was made interim Governor-General of East and West Prussia.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 1813 campaign lieutenant-general, entrusted with the siege of Stettin. Relieved by General Tauenzien, he then allied himself with generals York and Wittgenstein, marching to confront the French army detachment that had moved to the right bank of the Elbe under the viceroy of Italy.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> He fought the first successful battle at Möckern<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> on April 5, shortly afterwards capturing Halle,</p>
<p>which, however, he was soon forced to evacuate again owing to the retreat of the allied army.</p>
<p>Withdrew across the Elbe in order to take over the defence of Berlin, which Oudinot was threatening.</p>
<p>Victory at Luckau on June 4 crowned the enterprise.

<p>"After the ceasefire commanded the 3rd Prussian Army Corps under the supreme command of the Crown Prince of Sweden."<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> At the head of the 3rd Prussian Army Corps "saved Berlin a second time by the battle of Grossbeeren on August 23"; shielded Berlin for the third time by the battle of Dennewitz, September 6,

Owing to a delayed order not present at the battle of Ligny (June 15),<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> but after his union with Blücher, achieved by a forced march, he helped to decide the outcome of the battle of Belle Alliance.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> For this the Boor <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> appointed him Honorary Colonel of the 15th Regiment of the Line, which he had led so bravely and which was to bear his name. January 11, 1816 Biilow returned to his governorship, t February 25 of inflammation of the liver at Königsberg."

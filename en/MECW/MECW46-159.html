MARX TO ENGELS
<br>IN LONDON
<br>[Postcard]
<br>[Argenteuil,] 24 June 1882
<br>DEAR FRED,
<br>I got the REGISTERED LETTER yesterday; today I realised it in Paris. As a result of the present changeable weather I had an attack of muscular rheumatism in the region of my hips; as a result of this and other things a sleepless night from the 22nd to the 23rd on account of severe pain. No food the next day (though absolved my sulphur inhalation at Enghien yesterday); Dourlen called in the evening and helped by embrocating me with laudanum; ALL RIGHT now as regards this INCIDENT, except that slight twinges of muscular rheumatism still persist.
<br>As regards Enghien the first question to be answered — for this depends upon the individual — is whether the local sulphur spring is strong enough. AT ALL EVENTS Reinhardt got rid of his bronchitis here, like Longuet before him. The latter was also at Cauterets *at an earlier time long before his marriage. Its height above the sea level 1200-1400 <i>mètres</i> about. I should be very glad if I should not want it for the bronchial catarrh; at all events Cauterets was out of the question for this time. Helen<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> will arrive at St Lazare <i>gare où*</i> Longuet there to receive her.*
<br><i>Salut.</i>
<br>Your
<br>Moor
<br>[On the side reserved for the address]
<br>F. Engels. Esq.
<br>122 Regent's Park Road,
London, N. W.

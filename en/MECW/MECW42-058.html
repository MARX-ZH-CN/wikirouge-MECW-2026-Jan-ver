ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 27 February 1865</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>As you had <i>positively</i> promised to take the necessary steps regarding the newspapers<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <i>immediately</i> Meissner sent a positive reply, I counted on it that this had been done. Meanwhile, today I dispatched the necessary to Siebel,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Liebknecht and Klein in Cologne (for the <i>Rheinische Zeitung),</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> as there is no time to lose. If you have anyone else who can do anything, please write to them—PERHAPS Kugelmann? His letter returned enclosed, ditto Miquel whose high-faluting refashioning of the theory into a platform for mayoral dignity and bourgeois benevolence greatly amused me.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> It is more or less how Heinrich Bürgers will view the world if he should ever become mayor of Nippes or Kalscheuren.</p>
<p>Jones has got SESSIONS again, I have not been able to see him yet. More tomorrow, 7 o'clock has just struck and I must post this letter.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p>I have no port wine in the WAREHOUSE and will have to get hold of some first, but will do so immediately.

The notice was published anonymously in <i>Berliner Reform</i> (No. 53), <i>Düsseldorfer Zeitung</i> (No. 62), <i>Elberfelder Zeitung</i> (No. 62) and <i>Rheinische Zeitung</i> (No. 62) on 3 March 1865; <i>Oberrheinische Courier</i> (No. 56) on 7 March, and others. Moreover, on 9 March the <i>Rheinische Zeitung</i> carried a special article 'Für die Arbeiterpartei' about Engels' pamphlet containing long passages from it.</span>

<li id="cite_note-4"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-4">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">In his letter to Marx of 19 February 1865, Ludwig Kugelmann enclosed a letter from Miquel, a former member of the Communist League, dated 22 December 1864. Miquel alleged in it that Marx's work <i>A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</i> 'contains little of what is actually new' and that its conclusions were not applicable to Germany's social and political conditions. At the same time, Miquel tried to justify his desertion to the liberal camp.</span>

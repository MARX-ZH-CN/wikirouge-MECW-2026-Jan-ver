ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 10 February 1866<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>I have just spoken to Gumpert here and discussed your condition with him. He is firmly of the opinion you should try arsenic. He has used it in one case of carbuncles and one of very virulent furunculosis, and achieved a complete cure in approx. 3 months. He is now giving it to three ladies, so far with the greatest of success; they are positively thriving on it. FOWLERS SOLUTION is what he is giving, I believe it is 3 drops 3 times a day (I am not quite so sure about that any more), but altogether the patient takes <i>about 1 grain of arsenic a day.</i> In view of the specific effect that arsenic has with all skin diseases, there is every prospect of it being effective with you, too. He thinks iron would only have a symptomatic and hence strengthening effect. And with arsenic there is no special diet to be observed at all, <i>just living well.</i></p>
<p>You really must at last do something sensible now to shake off this carbuncle nonsense, even if the book.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> is delayed by another 3 months. The thing is really becoming far too serious, and if, as you say yourself, your brain is not UP TO THE MARK for the theoretical part, then do give it a bit of a rest from the more elevated theory. Give over working at night for a while and lead a rather more regular life. When you are yourself again, come up here for a fortnight or so, so that you have a bit of a change, and bring enough papers along with you for you to be able to do a spot of work here—if you like. Incidentally, the 60 sheets will make 2 thick volumes. Can you not so arrange things that the first volume at least is sent for printing first and the second one a few months later? This would keep both publisher<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> and public happy and yet no time will have been lost <i>realiter</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>You must also bear in mind that as things stand now, the situation on the Continent may change rapidly. In Prussia things are moving with marvellous rapidity. Bismarck is pressing hard for a crisis. First the decision by the Supreme Tribunal,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> and then now the threat of an authentic interpretation of the constitution by the King.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> The philistines' last illusion about peaceful historical development has gone to the devil. The first plausible pretext, perhaps no more than a serious complication over Schleswig-Holstein even, may be the spark that sets it off, once the troops are concentrated on the frontier; although I myself hardly believe that anything will happen without a more general cause, but the possibility is there. What would be gained in these circumstances by having perhaps a few chapters at the end of your book completed, and not even the first volume can be printed, if events take us by surprise? Something may happen any day in France, too, in Austria the attempted reconciliation with Hungary can only lead to sharper division.</p>
<p>Q.E.D.: get yourself back on your feet and <i>ad hoc</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> give the arsenic a try.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p>Kind regards to Madame<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> and the YOUNG LADIES.

This decision was adopted despite the fact that the courts of first and second instance rejected the prosecutor's demand to apply this measure to the said deputies. The Chamber of Deputies of the Prussian Provincial Diet found the Supreme Tribunal's decision contradictory to the Prussian Constitution and to the principle of the inviolability of deputies, and turned it down. Nevertheless, Twesten's case was referred to the Berlin City Court, but in May 1866 Twesten was acquitted.</span>

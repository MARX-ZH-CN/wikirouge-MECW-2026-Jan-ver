ENGELS TO GABRIEL DEVILLE</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>London, 8 July 1884</p>
<p>My dear Citizen Deville,</p>
<p>Thank you for sending me your lectures ' 7 9 — the last one reached me yesterday and I have not yet had time to read it. I have no doubt that it is no less excellent than its predecessors. I shall suggest to our friends that they translate them into German and publish them in the same way as you are doing in Paris; it's precisely what we need for propaganda just now.</p>
<p>Would you be so kind as to pass on the enclosed note to Lafargue <i>without Mme Lafargue's knowledge?</i> He'll tell you the reason for this — perfectly innocent, by the way.</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>F. Engels
</p>

ENGELS TO GABRIEL DEVILLE
<br>IN PARIS
<br>London, 8 July 1884
<br>My dear Citizen Deville,
<br>Thank you for sending me your lectures ' 7 9 — the last one reached me yesterday and I have not yet had time to read it. I have no doubt that it is no less excellent than its predecessors. I shall suggest to our friends that they translate them into German and publish them in the same way as you are doing in Paris; it's precisely what we need for propaganda just now.
<br>Would you be so kind as to pass on the enclosed note to Lafargue <i>without Mme Lafargue's knowledge?</i> He'll tell you the reason for this — perfectly innocent, by the way.
<br>Yours ever,
<br>F. Engels

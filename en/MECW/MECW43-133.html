<p><b>Dear Fred</b>,</p>
<p>Would you please study the enclosed document... <i>seriously,</i> despite its <i>fadaise</i>. [absurdity] <i>Your marginal notes</i> should be written for me in <i>French,</i> and the stuff itself <i>returned to me at the latest by</i> <b>Saturday next</b>.</p>
<p><i>Mr Bakunin —</i> in the background of this business — is condescending enough to wish to take the workers' movement under <i>Russian</i> leadership.</p>
<p>This shit has been in existence for 2 months. Only this evening did <b>Old</b> Becker inform the General Council about it in writing. This time Nincompoop is right. As <b>Old</b> Becker writes, this association should make up for the deficient '<i>idealism</i>' of our Association. <i>L'idéalisme Russe!</i></p>
<p>There was great anger about the document this evening at the meeting of our <i>Conseil Général,</i> particularly among the French. I had known about the shit for a long time. I regarded it as stillborn, and out of consideration for <b>Old</b> Becker, wanted to let it die a quiet death.</p>
<p>But the business has become more serious than I expected. And consideration for <b>Old</b> Becker is no longer admissible. This evening the <b>Council</b> decided to repudiate this <b>interloping society</b> publicly — in Paris, New York, Germany and Switzerland. I have been commissioned with drafting the decree of repudiation (for next Tuesday). I regret the whole thing, because of <b>Old</b> Becker. Mais our Association cannot commit <b>suicide</b> because of <b>Old</b> Becker.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.</p>
<p>Strohn writes to me from Düsseldorf that his brother Eugen has died suddenly in Hamburg.</p>
<p>About the <b>cotton bankruptcies</b> in Manchester, etc., can you send me <i>The Guardian?</i>

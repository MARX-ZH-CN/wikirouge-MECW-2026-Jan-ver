MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>London, 4 October 1868</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>In the package which you will receive simultaneously there are:</p>
<p>1. Two letters from <i>Eichhoff</i> the <i>forgotten one</i> and one which <i>arrived today</i>; 2. Letter from Liebknecht; 3. Letter from Borkheim; 4. Manuscript and letter from J. Dietzgen; 5. Letter from the Russian Danielson in Petersburg<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> ; 6. Letter from Lessner. Since most of these letters (which you must return with the exception of the manuscript) have only just arrived, in all haste the following:<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p><i>Ad No. 5.</i> I am naturally extraordinarily pleased to hear that my book will appear in Petersburg in <i>Russian</i> translation. I shall immediately send the people what they requested<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> (as far as I can) as soon as you have returned the letter.</p>
<p><i>Ad 4.</i> Read through the manuscript. My view is that J. Dietzgen would do best if he condensed all his ideas into <i>2 printed sheets</i> and had them printed in his name as a tanner. If he publishes them at the intended length, he will make a fool of himself because of the lack of dialectical development and the running in circles. Read it through and write your opinion.</p>
<p><i>Ad 3.</i> To understand Gaudissart's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> letter, briefly the following: He wanted to write about the Pan-Slav democratic movement; for this I gave him your articles about Bakunin in the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> His plan to appear with <i>you</i> before the public is excellent, but there is no hurry because he has not turned out his 25 printed sheets by a long way yet.</p>
<p>Secondly, he maintained a certain correspondence, despite my warning, with Dr Crapper, alias Elard Biscamp. Now that the latter has directly attacked me and the International in the <i>Weser-Zeitung</i> and the <i>Augsburgerin,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> he proposes, as you see, to publish in Liebknecht's paper his latest exchange of letters with Biscamp. <i>Ce brave</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> Gaudissart! In these letters he presents himself as <i>my</i> patron, and lets Biscamp flatter <i>him.</i> I wrote to him by return that I would have to protest tooth and nail against this sort of thing.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> For greater security I immediately wrote to <i>Liebknecht</i> that he <i>must not print</i> the Borkheim-Biscamp correspondence <i>under any circumstances.</i></p>
<p><i>Ad 1 and 2.</i> I have sent to Liebknecht for his political review an <i>entrefilet</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> about <i>M. Hirsch</i> (because of the 'International'), and, at the same time, a few blows at Biscamp as correspondent of the <i>Weser-Zeitung</i> and the <i>Augsburger.</i></p>
<p><i>Ad 6.</i> The £100 (of which ABOUT £35 for Laura) I have used to pay off the most urgent things and only kept as much on hand as is necessary in order not to be absolutely penniless. I still have about £100 of debts and will soon send you a list of the ITEMS so that you can see that there are no useless expenditures on my part. Now I received the enclosed note from Lessner today. His wife is mortally ill, and it would be very kind of you to enable me to pay him off something.</p>
<p>IN ALL HASTE.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Marx is referring to a letter written to him by Nikolai Danielson on 30 (18) September 1868, with a postscript by Nikolai Lyubavin dated 14 (2) October. Danielson wrote: 'The significance of your latest work—<i>Capital. Critique of Political Economy</i>—has prompted one of local publishers (N. Polyakov) to undertake its translation into Russian. The various attendant circumstances make it desirable to publish the second volume simultaneously with the first. Therefore, as the publisher's representative, I request you, should you consider it possible, to send me sheets of the second volume as soon as they have been published.' In his reply, Marx enclosed a note on his own literary and political activities, which was used in the preface to <i>Capital's</i> Russian edition (see this volume, pp. 123-25 and Note 196).</span>

ENGELS TO JULES GUESDE</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>London, 11 June 1887 122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Citizen Guesde,</p>
<p>I would gladly lend a hand in getting the <i>18th Brumaire</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> published in the resuscitated <i>Socialiste</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> but to this there are two minor obstacles.</p>
<p>In the first place, as you know, it was intended that, at the time of its publication in the <i>Socialiste,</i> the <i>Communist Manifesto</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> should also appear in book form.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> For reasons which are not known to me, that edition never appeared, and I should like to be assured that such a thing will not recur.</p>
<p>In the second place—and this is a matter of far greater moment—I am prevented by eye-trouble, which has been dragging on for the past six months, from taking on any literary commitments at the present time. And, since a great deal still remains to be done before the translation is completed, it is ten to one that printing will be held up and that we shall miss the boat altogether.</p>
<p>Hence I would ask you to allow the matter to drop, for the time being at any rate; later on, when I am again fit for work, we might discuss it further.</p>
<p>With best wishes for the success of the <i>Socialiste,</i></p>
<p>Yours very sincerely</p>
<p>F. Engels

Fortin's translation, sent to Engels somewhat earlier (see Engels' letter to Paul Lavigne of 1 December 1885 in Vol. 47 of the present edition) and edited by Engels at Fortin's request, was published first in Le Socialiste, the newspaper of the French Workers' Party, in January-November 1891 and appeared in book form in Lille the same year.</span>

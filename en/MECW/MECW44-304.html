ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE</p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>London, 14 June 1873</p>
<p>Dear Sorge,</p>
<p>Work on the <i>Alliance</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>has interrupted my correspondence. In addition the newspapers have only just started to arrive regularly again now that we have ordered them, and so it is only now that I can report properly again.</p>
<p>First, to deal with the points raised in your letters. The ones from the General Council<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>are answered in the enclosure.</p>
<p>14 May.—The business about the shortage of funds is as old as the International itself. The Americans were the only ones to pay, and if it hadn't been for you, we would have been unlikely to receive even that.—Postponing the Congress<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>is absolutely out of the question; it would mean abandoning the field to the other side and anyway is not at all necessary, as you will see.</p>
<p>23 May.—The people in Geneva I am supposed to be giving a kick do not even answer us. Even old Becker<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>does not reply to Marx. Outine is we know not where. We <i>ourselves</i> do not receive the <i>Bulletin jurassien,</i> and only see extracts quoted in the <i>Liberté</i> and the <i>Internationale.</i></p>
<p>27 May.—The statement on France<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>—<i>very good!</i>—has gone off in English to the BRITISH FEDERAL COUNCIL and will go off today in French to the <i>Plebe,</i> the Spanish Federal Council and Portugal. BY THE BYE the Portuguese are complaining that they are not receiving <i>anything at all</i> from you and yet they are very, <i>very</i> important for us!—Serraillier <i>has</i> absolutely nothing to write about, since he does not have a single address in France any more; <i>everyone</i> has been caught. However, he will send in a little report on the trials<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>for your own report to the Congress—there were trials <i>everywhere</i> where there were sections, in Béziers, Lisieux, etc., etc.—Correspondence for the <i>Arbeiter-Zeitung</i>: Who is to do it? Marx and I are so overworked that Marx has been limited by his doctor to 4 hours work a day because of blood-congestion in the head, so that I have to deal with <i>everything</i> together with Lafargue. Frankel works in his SHOP until 9 p.m. The others cannot write.—The Hamburgers<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>are numbskulls. I shall write and tell Liebknecht.—For Holland the <i>German</i> version of the statement will be adequate.—The <i>Arbeiter-Zeitung</i> should make more use of the <i>Volksstaat.</i></p>
<p>And now for some news, and this time it is no message of ill-tidings.</p>
<p>1. The British Congress, held in Manchester on 1 and 2 June, was a success.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>26 delegates.—Report from the Tory paper going off by BOOK-POST herewith; ditto 1 issue of the Brussels <i>Internationale.</i> The Federal Council to remain in London, although the locals wanted it transferred to Nottingham. <i>The Eastern Post,</i> hitherto the organ of Jung and Hales, has written a satirical article on the Congress which nevertheless acknowledges it as the real representative of the English International, and since then I observe that they have stopped publishing reports on BOGUS meetings in Hales' house; they seem to have shut up shop. Up to now they had always alternated these reports with reports from all of their 2 sections: Stratford and Limehouse, and Limehouse and Stratford; but this no longer seems to work.—Mottershead turned up in Hyde Park on Whit Monday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>for the TRADES UNION MEETING, completely drunk as usual.—I have not received <i>The International Herald</i> for the past 2 weeks, so that too seems to have folded up. It's no misfortune since there are the other publications of the English press. The new French section here (Dupont and Serraillier) have some chance of starting up a French paper here, though French assurances cannot be relied on very much.</p>
<p>2. The Jurassians have carried out their decisive retreat.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>You will see from the <i>Internationale</i> that they have resolved to propose to their colleagues in the Alliance: <i>not</i> to send representatives <i>to any congress</i> <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup>but to hold a separate congress <i>at a place in Switzerland to be determined by their federations.</i></p>
<p>Translated that means: we cannot put in an appearance in Geneva, otherwise we shall be thrown out on our ears. So they will meet in some corner of the Jura; after the Olten Congress (see below) they cannot show their faces anywhere else in Switzerland.—Other reasons are: 1. Bakunin's old reluctance to appear in debates personally, 2. Guillaume's and his own expulsion, which would raise the crucial issue from the very outset in a <i>purely</i> <i>personal</i> form, added to which there is also the fact of Bakunin's <i>escroquerie,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup>which would immediately finish him off, and 3. the certainty that in reality they are in as bad a way as we are and that internal squabbles have exhausted and irritated their people too. At their great Jura congress only <i>nine</i> sections were represented! In Italy, for all their bluster, they cannot put a single newspaper on its feet, and in Spain, in the movement as it stands, their stock is=0. More, they have had to renege on their own policy of abstention at once, and sent 8 members (10 according to them) into the Cortes.</p>
<p>3. In Rome a committee <b>of the International</b> has been disbanded. It was called <i>Società del Silenzio,</i> clandestine society, oath of absolute obedience, the sacramental formula at the end of letters—the one proclaimed by Bakunin last year: <i>Salute e liquidazione sociale, anarchia e collectivismo</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup>—in short, the secret Alliance, with its whole bag of tricks. It comes just at the right time.</p>
<p>4. Serraillier has had an exchange in the <i>Liberté</i> with the Blanquists about the French trials<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup>in which the latter took a very impudent line, but were duly boxed around the ears for it. What really finished them off was that after the letters of authority of those with mandates had been annulled at The Hague and the General Council was alone empowered to issue new ones,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup>Cournet and Ranvier issued a new letter of authority to Heddeghem in <i>their</i> names—and while still at The Hague!</p>
<p>5. Swiss workers' congress at Olten<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup>—70 delegates, 5 Jurassians, proposed decentralisation, defeated with all votes against their 5—they withdrew at once. But you will have known this long since from the <i>Tagwacht</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>I hope that your arm and voice are now recovered and that your prospects for the Congress have also improved. Even if the Congress is not very brilliant, it is nevertheless necessary and with some effort will turn out well. Don't forget that according to the Rules you must convoke it and prepare a programme 2 months in advance, i.e. by <i>1 July.</i> <i>Alliance</i> as good as finished—in French; a mammoth task in this tricky language—shall hit out and surprise even you.</p>
<p>Must catch the post. Cordial regards.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

Of the 31 delegates present at the Congress, 28 were representatives of the International's Swiss branches or its émigré sections in Switzerland. When considering the General Rules, the majority headed by Johann Philipp Becker endorsed the decisions of the Hague Congress of 1872 on extending the functions of the General Council (against opposition from Henri Perret and a number of other Swiss delegates). The Congress stressed the need for the working class to engage in political struggle. New York was left as the General Council's headquarters until the next Congress scheduled for 1875. The Geneva Congress of 1873 was the last congress of the International Working Men's Association.</span>

Twenty-two out of the 38 defendants were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment; Charles Larroque, a representative of the General Council who had managed to escape to Spain under an alias of Mortimer Latraque, was sentenced to three years' imprisonment <i>in absentia.</i> Apart from Toulouse, trials of the arrested members of the International were held in other towns of Southern France, including Cannes, Béziers, Narbonne, Perpignan, Montpellier, and Avignon.</span>

They voted that the Red Flag be declared the banner of the British Federation, and the land and all means of production be nationalised. Of particular importance was the resolution 'On Political Action,' which stressed the need to establish an independent proletarian political party in Britain.</span>

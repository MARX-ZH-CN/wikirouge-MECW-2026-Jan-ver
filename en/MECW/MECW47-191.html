ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY</p>
<p>IN EASTBOURNE</p>
<p>[Jersey,] Sunday [16 August 1885]</p>
<p>Dear Kautsky,</p>
<p>After sundry vagaries we landed here the day before yesterday morning and, after some difficulty, found accommodation;<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> The little place has not changed much in 10 years and is still quite pleasant when the weather is fine. We had a very good passage, though towards morning Nim, Pumps and Lily were somewhat overcome, or rather only the last two; Nim lay down and felt better. In Guernsey we unloaded some 10 calves and 20 sheep, a pitiful sight, for all of them were sea-sick. A supply of Pilsener beer has been discovered and is being rapidly consumed; there is also very good red wine at 10d. a bottle. I shall now leave the party to its own devices, but if you have anything of interest to tell me I shall be glad to hear about it. Address</p>
<p>2 Royal Crescent, Jersey.</p>
<p>Kind regards from us all to you, your wife and your mother.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F.E.

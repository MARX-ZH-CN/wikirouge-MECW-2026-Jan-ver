<blockquote>
<p>Marx's speech is recorded in the Minutes of the General Council meeting on June 20, 1871 as follows: "Citizen Marx then proposed that a letter should be sent to the Examiner and Spectator denouncing the pretended manifestoes of the Paris section of the International; they were all forgeries of the Versailles police" (The General Council of the First International. 1870-1871. Minutes, Moscow, 1967, p. 220). The letter written by Engels on behalf of the General Council did not appear in the aforementioned newspapers and only a rough draft of it has survived (see this volume, p. 379).

<p><b>[FROM THE NEWSPAPER REPORT ON THE GENERAL COUNCIL MEETING OF JUNE 20, 1871]</b>
</p>
</center><p>Citizen Marx said that he was glad to observe that the workmen on the continent were thoroughly outspoken upon the subject of the Commune. Meetings had been held in Geneva, Brussels, Munich, Vienna, and Berlin, denouncing the Thiers-Favre massacres. He also called attention to the fact that a number of so-called manifestoes had appeared in the French papers, purporting to be issued by the Paris section of the International. They were all forgeries issued by the French police for the purpose of entrapping the unwary, it shewed the dirty actions to which a despicable government could descend.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p><div class="mw-references-wrap"><ol class="references">

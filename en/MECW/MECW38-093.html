<p>Dear Weydemeyer,</p>
<p>I have heard from Dronke that it's no go with the Westphalian lady. Well, it can't be helped.</p>
<p>Now I should appreciate your advice as to how best to publish pamphlets.</p>
<p>I should like to start with the pamphlet on <i>wages</i> of which only the beginning appeared in the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung.</i> [Wage Labour and Capital] I would write a short political foreword to it on the present <i>status quo</i>. Do you think that, e.g., Leske would be agreeable? But he would have to pay, as soon as he had the manuscript in his hands, and pay well, since I know that this pamphlet will attract and will find a mass of subscribers in advance. My present financial condition will not permit me to settle my outstanding account with Leske.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Were Leske then to find that the thing is well received, we could continue in this way.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had a letter from Engels; he is in Switzerland and, as Willich's adjutant, has taken part in four encounters.</p>
<p>The sword of Damocles still hangs over my head; my expulsion has neither been rescinded nor, for the moment, is it being enforced.</p>
<p>Awkward though the present state of affairs may be for our personal circumstances, I am nevertheless among the satisfied. Things are going very well and the Waterloo<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> suffered by official democracy<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> may be regarded as a victory. 'Governments by grace of God' are taking it upon themselves to avenge us on the bourgeoisie, and to chastise them.</p>
<p>One of these days I may perhaps send you a short article for your paper [Neue Deutsche Zeitung] on the state of affairs in England.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> Just now I find it too boring, having already discussed the matter in a number of private letters.</p>
<p>Write to me <i>direct</i> and to <i>my own</i> address: 45, rue de Lille, Monsieur Ramboz.</p>
<p>My best regards to your wife and yourself from my wife and me. The former very poorly, the natural consequence of her all too interesting condition. Good-bye, my friend, and reply soon.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.

But as early as March 1846 Leske suggested that Marx find another publisher and, in case he did find one, return him the advance received. Therefore Marx hoped to repay Leske either when he signed a contract with a new publisher or out of the sum received for financing the planned publication. But Marx was unable either to sign a new contract or to fulfil his intention to write a work on economics, and in February 1847 the contract with Leske was cancelled.</span>

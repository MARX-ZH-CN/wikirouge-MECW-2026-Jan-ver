MARX TO ENGELS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 16 April 1860</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Have had some most valuable material from Lommel today.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> However, he volunteered to submit to a further CROSS-EXAMINATION, and one such has already gone off to him today.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> It was also much needed. Moreover, in the letter in which I buttered him up, I suggested he should send 300 copies of his <i>Hinter den Coulissen</i> to Petsch (the booksellers) here. I would promote the sales (in working men's clubs, etc.). Now he wants an advance of 150 francs. I think that you in Manchester should CI.UB together <i>forthwith</i> and raise a few pounds, while I would find the rest down here. The man is <i>invaluable</i> to us. He has also written about this to Siebel. Hence I shall also drop the latter a couple of lines today. Siebel should do nothing without first consulting me.</p>
<p>I enclose Weydemeyer's letter.</p>
<p><i>Not a word yet</i> from that confounded lawyer,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> to whom I sent a reminder last Friday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> However, he's got the retaining fee, and I his acceptance of the brief. So, I cannot imagine that he will lay himself open to a lawsuit against himself.</p>
<p>A lot more sanctimonious preaching from Lassalle, together with a printed essay (on <i>Fichte's political legacy</i>)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> for Walesrode's political pocket edition, not yet out.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> It appears from L.'s letter that he has read your pamphlet,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> which.means it <i>has come out in Berlin.</i> Presumably the publisher will only start advertising it now, along with the Easter eggs. L.'s letter is altogether fatuous. He's been ill again. He is again writing a 'major work'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> Aside from this major work, he has in his mind a clear outline of three other major works, including the 'political economy', and is, in addition, studying 6-7 unnamed sciences 'with productive intent'. The Countess,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> he writes, has lost a great deal of money, for which reason he must go to Cologne. Probably misguided speculation in railways, etc.</p>
<p>Mont Sion does in fact exist, or so I see from the map included in the BLUE BOOK on Savoy<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> (in the Genevois, EX-NEUTRAL).</p>
<p>Apropos. Questions for Lupus:</p>
<p>1. In one of his letters from Zurich I find that he was acquainted with Brass. Could he supply any information about him?</p>
<p>2. Did the rump parliament in Stuttgart<sup>I54</sup> pass a resolution whereby the former imperial regents have the right to recall the German parliament on any particular occasion?</p>
<p>Do you or Lupus know anything about a request for annexation sent in 1849 by the then provisional government of the Palatinate to the French National Assembly?</p>
<p>When are you coming down here?</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Moor</p>
<p>Haven't seen Freiligrath yet. The idea of meeting the chap is 'awful',<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> and yet I've got to swallow the bitter pill. If only for diplomatic reasons, after our mutual assurances of friendship.</p>
<p>And then, he has written to me in an AMIABLE manner.

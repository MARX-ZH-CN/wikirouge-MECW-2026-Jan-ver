MARX TO FERDINAND LASSALLE</p>
<p>IN BERLIN</p>
<p>[London,] 28 January 1861</p>
<p>Dear Lassalle,</p>
<p>I am writing to you today in some haste, not from home, but from the City. In a few days, you shall have a longer letter and a reply <i>to all your inquiries.</i> First, my thanks for your package. I have passed one COPY of the petition to Freiligrath. Engels will receive No. II; No. III will be retained by me. It is a truly splendid document and is part and parcel of the history of the present era.</p>
<p>Perhaps you would be good enough to see that the enclosed note is delivered to Mr Eichhoff <i>without delay.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Owing to the current state of your health, friendly duty precludes my spurring you on to fresh labours. OTHERWISE I would have declared an anti-Zabel pamphlet, such as you envisage, to be a political deed.</p>
<p>My wife sends her kindest regards to you and the countess.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Her convalescence is proceeding satisfactorily. I, for my part, expect I shall be able to forego all medicine for some time to come (I finished the last BOTTLE yesterday).</p>
<p>My best respects to the countess. In my next letter to you I shall take the liberty of enclosing a line or two for her.</p>
<p><i>Tout à vous</i><sup>h</sup></p>
<p>K. Marx

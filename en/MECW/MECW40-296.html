ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 4 November 1859</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Freiligrath really deserves to be severely chastised for once and I hope that an opportunity will present itself before the Schiller nonsense is over (or its after-pains).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>Such poet's vanity and literary presumption combined with toadyism is altogether too much, and on top of that the <i>Augsburger</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>credits him with political virtue!</p>
<p>I suppose you read about Vogt's law-suit<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>in the Augsburg <i>Allgemeine Zeitung,</i> No. 297 <i>et seq.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>? The thing went quite well, but Biskamp's letter is shockingly discreditable. The fellow could perfectly well have dealt with his private affairs in a separate note but, as things are, it is exceedingly distasteful that the editor of the <i>Volk</i> should send the Augsburg <i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i> a testimonial, begging to be taken on as correspondent, and that this should appear in print. Vogt will make a great noise about it. Why do we always have such tactless idiots hanging round us?</p>
<p>But most satisfactory is the discrediting of Blind. The statement in your letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>and the document<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>have now obliged the worthy diplomat to come creeping out into the open, if only to save himself being discredited still further. He has boasted about the evidence he possesses and, if he holds his tongue, will seem an unmitigated liar.</p>
<p>Vogt is in no less nice a mess. Case dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, ordered to pay all the costs, and referred to a jury—what can he do?</p>
<p>He will have to sue either the Augsburg <i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i> before a Bavarian jury—in which case he will be doomed in advance—or the <i>Volk</i>—and then Blind will be SUBPOENAED—or else Blind himself. In any case, it will turn out badly for him, and I don't see how he can do anything but discredit himself still more.</p>
<p>All this is most consoling. Garibaldi would seem to be playing a somewhat ambiguous role. A general of that ilk is in a difficult position. Once he had been forced to compound with the devil, there was no turning back. For Victor Emmanuel the obvious thing is, of course, first to exploit Garibaldi and then ruin him. <i>Altro esempio</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>of how far you get with a 'practical attitude' in a revolution. It's a pity about the chap, though. Excellent, on the other hand, that Piedmont should lose its spurious character as representative of Italian unity.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>I shall do you an article about army reform in Germany when this affair has progressed a little further. Far-reaching things are happening in the sphere of military organisation, not only in Prussia but elsewhere, in Austria, etc. Everywhere the French style of uniform, etc., is being adopted, and in many respects this even means quite definitely putting the clock back. But so far everything's still rather confused; as soon as I can clarify my ideas a little I'll do the article for you.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>I also hope that soon there'll be something further for me to report on in China and the Far East GENERALLY. Likewise Morocco.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>But none of this has come to a head yet. About Morocco next week perhaps.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup>Have you already written about it, or could you, perhaps, let me have some political information <i>ad vocem</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup>Pam on the subject so that I am <i>au fait</i></p>
<p>At the moment I'm deep in Ulfilas.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup>It was really high time for me to polish off that damned Gothic, which I'd always been so desultory about. To my surprise I find I know far more than I thought; if only I can get hold of another reference book, I think I shall polish this off completely in a fortnight. Then I shall go on to Old Norse and Anglo-Saxon, with which I've never been on more than nodding terms. So far, I've been working without a dictionary or other reference book save the Gothic text and Grimm.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup>However, that old fellow is really splendid.</p>
<p>What I need badly here is Grimm's <i>Geschichte der deutschen Sprache.</i> Could you let me have it back?</p>
<p>I think I shall see Lupus this evening. We are having a Schiller festival up here too (programme enclosed). Needless to say, I have nothing whatever to do with the thing. Mr Alfr. Meissner is sending a prologue, and Siebel will do the epilogue, straightforward recitation, of course, but done in proper form. In addition, this <i>flâneur</i> is producing a performance of 'Wallensteins Lager'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup>; I've been to two of the rehearsals and, if the chaps keep their nerve, it might be quite passable. The committee members are, without exception, a bunch of fools; among the public Borchardt plays at being in opposition. He's no less negatively pompous than the others are positively so, except that his negation is based on the same point of view as the position of the others, i.e. he admits that he is essentially one of their number.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>

The preparations in London were handled by a jubilee  committee consisting of petty-bourgeois refugees headed by Gottfried Kinkel,  who hoped to use the festival for his own publicity purposes.—508, 511, 514,  525</span>

The  case was heard on 24 October 1859. In early August the editors of the  <i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i> had asked Liebknecht for proof of the accusations against  Vogt contained in<i> Zur Warnung.</i> Liebknecht requested Marx to help him obtain  Blind's admission that he, Blind, was the author of the anonymous pamphlet.  Marx considered such an admission necessary also because Vogt had declared  Marx to be the author of the pamphlet. Besides, Marx wanted to expose the  cowardice of this petty-bourgeois democrat who dared not challenge  Bonaparte's agents openly and was, as it were, aiding and abetting Vogt in his  dispute with the<i> Allgemeine Zeitung.</i> Though Marx emphatically condemned the  paper's conservative views, in this case he assisted it in the interests of the  common struggle against Bonapartism. The court dismissed Vogt's action (see  present edition, Vol. 17, pp. 111-32, also pp. 3 and 8-9).—488, 503, 507, 514,  519, 520</span>

The plan had been put forward  by Italy's democrats headed by Mazzini, who were not satisfied with the  Villafranca treaty (see Note 370). The march was to take place in late October  or early November 1859.  Victor Emmanuel, King of Sardinia, and his liberal following at first sought  to exploit Garibaldi for the unification of Italy under the aegis of the Sardinian  dynasty, but fearing an outbreak of popular unrest in Central Italy diey  succeeded in having the expedition cancelled.—515</span>

The fighting continued until March 1860. In April a peace treaty  was concluded under which Spain received indemnities and insignificant  territorial concessions.—515, 523</span>

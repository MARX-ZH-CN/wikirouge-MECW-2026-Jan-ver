(TO THE FIRST PART)</p><blockquote><p><i>Written in June 1858</i></p>
<p><i>First published in: Karl Marx, Grundrisse der Kritik der politischen Oekonomie. Appendix. Moscow, 1941</i></p>
<p><i>Published in English for the first time in Marx-Engels Collected Works, Volume 29, 1987</i></p>
<p>This manuscript marks the transitional stage in Marx's work on a draft version of his economic work in preparing it for publication in parts, as agreed by contract with the German publisher Duncker. In order to develop the rough manuscript further, Marx drew up a kind of index that would help him select material for the first part. In his <a href="MECW40-170.html">letter to Engels on May 31, 1858</a>, Marx wrote that his hefty manuscript (308 densely written pages in seven notebooks) was a real hotchpotch, much of it intended for later sections. "So I shall have to make an index," Marx wrote,"briefly indicating in which notebook and on what page to find the stuff I want to work on first".</p>
<p>First of all, Marx had to elaborate the material that was to form the first part of the planned work. By the "first part", Marx then meant that which he soon began to designate as the "first section" of his book "On Capital", consisting of three chapters: "The Commodity", "Money", and "Capital in General". In the Economic Manuscript of 1857-1858, however, there is no special chapter on the commodity; the beginning of it is only outlined, under the title: "Value". Individual digressions in other sections of the manuscript also belonged to it.</p>
<p>The Index to the 7 Notebooks (to the first part) consists of two unfinished drafts; in the first one, Marx gathered all the material of his manuscript belonging to the "first part", up to the section on the circulation of capital, but this section and some other passages preceding it remained without page references; the second draft embraces only the chapter on money and presents a more detailed structure of this chapter.</p>
<p>Marx left big gaps between the main headings of his Index, later to be filled in with additional subheadings and page references.</p>
<p>The Index to the 7 Notebooks (to the first part) fills the last eleven pages in Notebook M (figures in the editorial square brackets denote pages of this notebook), which contains the outline of Marx's "Introduction" (see MECW, Vol. 28, pp. 17-48). In this edition Marx's marks in the margins are not reproduced.</p>
<p>
In his Index, Marx indicates the numbers of notebooks containing the outlines of the Critique of Political Economy by Roman numerals, and the pages of those notebooks by Arabic numerals.</p></blockquote><center>

Gold and silver as money of account do not express any value, but merely fractional parts of their own substance. Their title is not that of a value: they constitute their own denominator (I.e., p. 9). (Hence nominally undepreciable.) Falls and rises in the value of gold and silver (Notebook I, 10) (VII, 29).

<p><br></p><center>
<p>[Second Draft]
</p>
</center><p>[M-29] (1) Money as measure</p>
<p>When paper money is denominated in a metallic (in general, in any) STANDARD, its convertibility is, whether legally or not, an economic law. The controversial questions concerning convertibility therefore become purely technical—how to ensure this convertibility, legal or not, etc. (Notebook I, p. 8). Hence the theory of the ideal standard, i.e. NO STANDARD AT ALL, held by the consistent adherents to CONVERTIBILITY (p. 9, ibid.) (p. 10).</p>
<p>Nominal undepreciability of money, not because it alone expresses an authentic value, but because it expresses no value at all; rather, its price, what is called the mint price, is nothing more than the name for certain quantities of its own substance (I, 9).</p>
<p>Labour money (I, 11) (12) (VII, 57).</p>
<p>Money is the exchange value of the commodities which exists independently alongside them and into which they must be converted (I, 13). Into a qualitatively different element. In this way, they become commensurable (I, 14) (I, 35).</p>
<p>The exchange value of commodities in money is determined by the labour time contained in them (I, 25) (I, 35). (How it actually takes place. Ibid.)</p>
<p>Price (I, 35) (36). As measure, money always serves as money of account, and as price the commodity is always transformed into money only notionally (I, 36) (Gamier I.e.). This notional transformation has nothing to do with the supply of money (I.e.) (38, I, Hubbard). The relation of prices to the value of money (I, 37).</p>
<p>Money as measure differs from money as means of circulation (Gamier, Storch I, 36) (I, 37). (Gouge. Measure in the American colonies VII, 27.) Scotland (VII, 38) (VII, 55. Wilson<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> ). (Money among the ancient Germans. Wirth.)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>For money as measure its material presence is irrelevant, but it is conceived of as a substance (its material presence is essential in the imagination, not as a determination outside the commodity) (I, 41, 42) (43) (VII, 29 bottom) (30, 31 ibid.) (32, 33) (34) (35). Assignats (35). (Ideal measure.)</p>
<p>IDEAL STANDARD OF MONEY (Steuart VII, 26, 27) (VII, 38). Urquhart (VII, 55).</p>
<p>DOUBLE STANDARD (VII, 29) (VII, 38) (VII, 55).</p>
<p>[M-30] As measure, money does not need to be invariable in value (Bailey VII, 35, 36).</p>
<p>Fixing the money of account (Müller VII, 36) (VII, 38). Depreciation of the STANDARD (VII, 55 Morrison).</p>
<p>Causes of the rise in the price of bullion above the mint price (Fullarton VII, 55) (VII, 61) (Macleod 1698), etc., (Notebook [p.] 2) sqq.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>(1) Notional transformation of commodities into money. So money is measure. The exchange value of commodities is expressed as price. So money becomes money of account. Labour time is the measure between money and commodity. How this takes place in reality.</p>
<p>(2) A definite quantity of this particular substance, which is as such therefore decisive, but only as imagined. Actual presence is of no consequence for this process; similarly, the quantity of money available. Money as measure can exist independently of money as actual means of exchange.</p>
<p>(3) As money of account, money acquires a universal social existence in the mint price; instead of the actual weight, the reckoning is done with its name. This is the mint price. Apparent non-depreciability of money. Depreciation. Appreciation.</p>
<p>(4) The laws very simple: (a) If the value of money falls or rises, the money prices of commodities conversely rise or fall.</p>
<p>(b) The division must be fixed, i.e. definite quantities must always bear the same name. But if money is used as measure, variations in its value are of no consequence. Its mint price does not express any value, but only a quantity. This is the FIXED STANDARD.</p>
<p>(c) One metal must be the measure. No DOUBLE STANDARD.</p>
<p>(5) Historical survey on the IDEAL STANDARD. Labour money, etc. [M-31] (2) Money as means of exchange</p>

<p>Transcendental power of money I, 15. Fortuitousness of the convertibility of commodities into money. (I, 15 bottom and 16). Separation of purchase and sale (I, 16) (16, 17). Exchange value is a quality completely inherent in the commodities, simultaneously outside them.</p>
<p>Separation of purchase and sale (I, 39). (A multitude of apparent transactions is possible I, 40.) (Social estate of merchants I.e.) (Germ of crises I, 39. I, 40.) Absolute division of labour possible (I.e.) (cf. 17, 18) (I, 40). [To obtain the thing required,] MONEY HAS only 1 EXCHANGE to make, commodities 2 (VII, 49). Corbet (VII, 52). Money circulation and commodity circulation are inverse movements (I, 34) (I, 37). Distinction. Money remains in circulation (I, 40) (41)</p>

<p>The split-up nature of money circulation (I, 34). (Distinction from bank circulation ibid.) (VII, 25). The quantity of turnovers. In circulation proper, money ceases to be a commodity (ibid. [I, 34]). Turnover of money. Is means of circulation, has a circulation in its own right (I.e.). Commodities and money circulate each other. External moments determining money circulation (I.e.). Circulation as total movement (I, 38). (Here for the first time a social process appears as a social nexus in opposition to the individuals.) Formal character of simple circulation (II, 16, 17) (VII, 29).</p>
<p>The quantity of commodities and prices The commodities as prices are preposited to circulation. As prices, they are imagined as money not merely by the individual, but by all exchangers. We set out from the proposition that only equivalents are exchanged. But the determination of price always precedes the actual circulation process (I, 34). (Quantity of the circulating medium.) Presupposition of circulation: Firstly, fixation of prices. The commodities are assumed as determined in price. Secondly. Totality of exchanges (I, 34 bottom). As price, the commodity appears as a particular existence of exchange value, alongside money as its universal adequate [existence] (I, 37). Properly speaking, money only circulates the titles of ownership (I, 37).</p>
<p>[M-32] Value of money. Money remains a commodity only as means of circulation VII, 56 (J. St. Mill). 57 I.e. Sismondi.</p>
<p>Quantity of the circulating medium (I, 37 bottom). Depends on the level of prices and the number of transactions. On the velocity [of circulation] (Galiani VII, 49) (38, I). A definite quantity is necessary for simultaneous payments, acts of exchange (I, 38). Contraction and expansion of circulation (I, 46). Steuart, etc. Locke, etc. (VII, 26). (W. Blake VII, 29.) James Mill's theory (VII, 57, 58). A passage on velocity (Galiani VII, 49) (VII, 61 Fullarton) (Ricardo VII, 59).</p>
<p>Money a means to circulate the immovable (Bray, Free Trade<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-2" id="cite_ref-:0_2-1">[2]</a></sup> etc. VII, 59).</p>

<p>(1. c ) . (Represents in the totality of circulation a greater quantity of silver and gold than it actually contains.) Distinction between money as realisation of prices and means of circulation (1. c.) (represents the prices of commodities in relation to one another). Because of this contradiction: effects of the counterfeiting of money, of merely symbolic money (I, 45, 46). Is money a commodity or not? (1. c.) productive or not? (1. c.) (Ferrier,</p>
<p>A. Smith) (47). (Solly I, 47. BARTER or not?) (Means of production I, 47.)</p>
<p>Money as realising prices. Price exists outside the commodity; the commodity is perhaps not posited as price, etc. (I, 39) (44) (45). Money as means of circulation figures only as something to be alienated. Not for consumption (II, 4).</p>

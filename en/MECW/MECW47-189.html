ENGELS TO NIKOLAI DANIELSON</p>
<p>IN ST PETERSBURG</p>
<p>London, 8 August 1885</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I have considered your proposal to write a special preface for the Russian edition, but I do not see how I could do so in a satisfactory way.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>If you consider that it will be better not to refer to Rodbertus at all, then I would propose that you leave out the whole of the second part of the preface. As an exposition of the author's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> place in the history of economical science, it is far too incomplete, unless justified by the special circumstances under which it was written, viz. the attacks of the Rodbertus clique. This clique is extremely influential in Germany, makes a deal of noise, and will no doubt soon also be heard of in Russia. It is such a very cheap and convenient way of settling the whole question, to say that our author merely copied Rodbertus, that it is sure to be repeated everywhere where our author is read and discussed. But of all these matters you are the best judge, and so I leave the matter entirely in your own hands, the more so as I have not the remotest idea what your censorship would allow to pass and what not.</p>
<p>There are some favourable rumours spread here about our mutual friend;<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> can you give me any news?</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>F. Engels

The Polish edition appeared in Paris in 1885, and the Russian translation was published in St Petersburg in 1894.</span>

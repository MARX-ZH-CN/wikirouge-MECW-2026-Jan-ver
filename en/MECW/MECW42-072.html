<p>Dear <b>Fred</b>,</p>
<p>Returned home some twenty-four hours ago. So, for the moment just a few lines to let you know.</p>
<p>Letter from Wilhelmchen enclosed. I sent him the <b>stamps</b> he asked for.</p>
<p><em>Quoad</em> B. Becker, I didn't get to see his dirty work until I got here. But thought reply really was needed ['the "President of Mankind"']. (Rüstow and Herwegh have replied in the <em>Nordstern</em> on behalf of Hatzfeldt. Rüstow calls B. Becker a '<em>police-spy'.</em>) Sent it to <em>Rheinische</em> and <em>Düsseldorfer.</em> As soon as copies arrive, 1 for you.</p>
<p>I shall attend a <b>sitting</b> of the '<b>International</b>' this evening for the first time for 3 weeks. In the interval, revolution. Le Lubez and Denoual gone, Dupont <b>appointed French Secretary</b>. As a result of Le Lubez's intrigues, and more particularly those of Major Wolff who is <b>a tool</b> in Mazzini's hand, the Italian delegates Lama and Fontana have left. Pretext: Lefort (who has meanwhile announced his departure in the <em>journal L'Association</em>) must keep his post as <b>defender general in the Paris press</b>. The Italian <b>Working men's Club</b> has not withdrawn from the Association, but no longer has a <b>representative</b> on the <b>Council</b>. Meanwhile, I shall get Bakunin to lay some counter-mines for Mr Mazzini in Florence. The English <b>Shoemakers' Union</b> — 5,000 strong — has joined the Association during <b>my absence</b>.</p>
<p>How's the <b>cotton-crisis? I want information on that point</b>.</p>
<p>In great haste.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.

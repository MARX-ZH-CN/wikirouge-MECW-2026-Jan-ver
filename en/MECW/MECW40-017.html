MARX TO ENGELS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 23 May 1856</p>
<p>28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>The family went off yesterday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I have been incapable of work this week, partly because of the TROUBLE in the house, partly because of a rheumaticky back such as I have never experienced before.</p>
<p>Herewith Bazancourt<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> —the 'Napoleonic' account of the Crimean business. Might not something be made of it for <i>Putnam's}</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> It's urgent that I obtain the services of this firm since the money and gear needed for the journey have compelled me to accept through Zitschke a sole bill for £30 on myself, payable in 3 months' time. A man from <i>Putnam's</i> has been to see Freiligrath, and they are willing to take articles.</p>
<p>I have only read the excerpts from Bazancourt that were published in the French papers. To judge by them, it would appear to provide much amusing matter. The thing cannot, I</p>
<p>think, be treated other than flippantly. If done, it should not be made too short, but solely with the idea of filling up space.</p>
<p>Trübner, who looked like accepting my Swedish stuff two months ago but then gave no further sign of life, wrote yesterday and arranged an <i>entrevue</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> on Tuesday to discuss the matter. That would provide 20 sheets of work.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>I am in a SERIOUS DILEMMA as to whether or not I should now go on a TRIP. On the one hand I've got to slog away at making money. On the other the doctor<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> has told me—and I believe he's right—that I should travel a bit and have a change of air, as my liver is again functioning irregularly. I AM NOT YET DECIDED what I should do. It's not as though staying here were especially economical, since I also have Pieper round my neck. But the main thing is my work.</p>
<p>As TO Bazancourt, let me know whether you need the first part as well. If nothing can be made of the thing it would be better not to buy it.</p>
<p>I am incapable of writing today, but must nevertheless ask you to clear up a philological doubt. In <i>Henry IV,</i> Shakespeare used the word 'hiren' for 'siren' and, according to a note made by that pedant, Johnson,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> the form 'hiren' also occurs in other early English writers.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> The substitution of h for s is QUITE in order, but might there not be some connection between 'hiren' and 'Hure',<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> and hence also 'siren'? Or with 'hoeren',<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> <i>auris,</i> etc.? You can see TO WHICH LOW STATE OF SPIRIT I am DEPRESSED today from the great interest I show in this matter.</p>
<p>I have received some very curious information about Ruge's tragedy, the <i>Neue Welt,</i> in which 'the tragedy of love turns into a farce'. Shall tell you about it in my next.</p>
<p>Herzen is going to Switzerland. I await your COMMUNICATIONS on Ireland.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

In the autumn of that year he summed up the results of his critical  analysis in an article entitled 'Saint-Arnaud'. Marx sent the article to the  American journal<i> Putnam's Monthly,</i> but the editors returned it unpublished.—  45, 51, 71, 73, 80, 93, 106, 124, 126, 128</span>

<li id="cite_note-6"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-6">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">This refers to a work planned by Marx on the history of-British and Russian  diplomacy in the eighteenth century, of which he only completed five chapters  of the Introduction. For these he made use of pamphlets, diplomatic  documents and unpublished manuscripts, mostly of the period of the Northern  War (the Russo-Swedish war of 1700-21), which he found in the British  Museum Library. His negotiations with Nikolaus Trübner for publication of the  work ended in failure. The chapters of the Introduction appeared by  instalments in Urquhart's<i> Sheffield Free Press</i> from late June to early August 1856  as they were sent in by Marx. Eventually publication was stopped because of  arbitrary editorial abridgements and printing errors. In June 1856 the London  <i>Free Press</i> began reprinting the text from the Sheffield paper, and on 16  August 1856 it started reproducing the chapters from the beginning, with  publication continuing until 1 April 1857. In both papers the unfinished work  was printed under the title<i> Revelations of the Diplomatic History of the 18th  Century</i> (see present edition, Vol. 15).  In 1899 Eleanor Aveling, Marx's daughter, published it in London in book  form under the heading<i> Secret Diplomatic History of the Eighteenth Century.</i>—46,  56, 73, 81, 94, 110, 112, 120</span>

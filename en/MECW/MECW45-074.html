MARX TO PYOTR LAVROV<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 3 December 1875<br>41 Maitland Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p>A carbuncle (and on my left nipple to boot)—which you may actually inspect for yourself by coming to call on me—makes it quite impossible for me to go out in the evening to attend the meeting of 4 December. For that matter, I should only have reiterated the opinion I have upheld for the past thirty years,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>namely that the emancipation of Poland is one of the precondi- tions for the emancipation of the working class in Europe. The new conspiracies of the Holy Alliance 143 provide further proof of this.</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

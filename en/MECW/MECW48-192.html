<p>TO A. F. ROBINSON IN LONDON</p>
<p>London, 21 May 1889 122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Mr A. F. Robinson 47 Little George St. Hampstead Road</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>As I am informed that you are now in good work and well able to repay gradually the 25sh. I advanced to you, and Mr Lahr your neigh- bour is out of work, I request you to pay the above money to him in such weekly payments as you may agree amongst yourselves and as are reasonable, and I shall consider their receipt—Mr and Mrs Lahr's—for the money as good as my own.</p>
<p>I am, Sir,</p>
<p>Yours respectfully</p>
<p>F. Engels

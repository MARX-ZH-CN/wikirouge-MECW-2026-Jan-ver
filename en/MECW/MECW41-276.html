<p><i>To Marx in London</i></p>
<p><b>Manchester, 19 February 1863</b></p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>As regards Poland I am entirely of your opinion. I've been toying with the idea of a pamphlet for the past fortnight. However, your suggestion is better, as it means that the diplomatic stuff goes in at the same time and it's an advantage to do the thing together.</p>
<p>How many sheets is the whole to amount to and how many of those do you think ought to be devoted to my bit? The form it takes will more or less depend on this. Who will print it? And when will your bit be ready for printing?</p>
<p>About machinery anon.</p>
<p>Your<br>F. E.
</p>

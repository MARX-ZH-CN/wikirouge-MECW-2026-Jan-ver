ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE</p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>London, 5 October 1872</p>
<p>122 Regent's Park Road, N.W.</p>
<p>Dear Sorge,</p>
<p><i>On vous taille de la besogne.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Enclosed the French translation (because the wording can be done most literally in that language) of 2 articles from the <i>Federation</i> (Alerini's paper).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> However, the Belgians are not really so terrifying. According to letters received subsequently they have already taken fright at their own boldness and do not know how to extricate themselves; in addition the disorganisation in the International in Belgium increases daily, which is very useful in view of the need to re-organise every- thing.</p>
<p>In contrast, you cannot simply ignore the resolutions of the Jurassians which, having been passed by a Federal Congress, amount to an open declaration of war.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <i>Le Conseil général est tenu d'exécuter les résolutions du Congrès</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> (Geneva Resolution). We wrote off to Geneva at once for the latest <i>Bulletin jurassien</i> and shall send it to you as soon as it arrives. In addition, you could if you want write directly to the <i>Comité Fédéral Jurassien</i> (address: Adhémar Schwitzguébel, graveur, Sonvillier, Jura Bernois, Suisse) and ask for information.</p>
<p>It is a very good thing that these gentlemen have openly declared war and thus given us a sufficient reason to show them the door. After this open declaration it is impossible for a majority of the federations to demand that the matter be brought before a Congress<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> especially since <i>at most</i> 4 would vote in favour (they themselves, the Spaniards, Belgians and Dutch), while all the rest would be against. Swift, vigorous action against these eternal troublemakers is, in our view, very much in place as soon as you have the evidence in your hands, and will probably suffice to disperse the threatened <i>Sonderbund.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Yesterday I sent you Nos. 65, 66 and 67 of the <i>Emancipation.</i> The fact that Guillaume had told Wilmart in Brussels that the Spaniards would re-establish the Alliance since now, after the Hague Congress, it was more necessary than ever, was report- ed by Wilmart himself in a letter to Lafargue (which I have read).</p>
<p>I had intended to enclose the report on Spain, Portugal and Italy to the General Council<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> but will not have it ready in time for the post. However, I do enclose my report to Section 6,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> which you can give to Bertrand.</p>
<p>Here Hales has launched a colossal slander campaign against Marx and myself, but it is rebounding on him without our having to lift a finger.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> The pretext was Marx's statement about the corruptness of the English labour leaders. Some London sections and the whole of Manchester have protested most vigorously and Hales has lost his former majority in the FEDERAL COUNCIL, so that he will probably be thrown out entirely soon.</p>
<p>That damned Lucain has still not sent us the papers about the Alliance that he took with him, so we are still unable to make a start/ The documents subsequently received from Switzerland give a full account of the Nechayev trial<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> and include some Russian publications of Bakunin's. They are all highly interesting and will cause a fearful scandal. I have never seen such an infamous band of scoundrels in all my life.</p>
<p><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>My wife<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> discovered after your departure that Emma had accepted money from you for your laundry and asks me to tell you that this was done behind her back, for otherwise she would never have permitted it.</p>
<p>Do not forget the minutes of the mandate debate,;<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup> since without them we cannot include that section in the minutes<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup> no one here has anything on it.</p>
<p>With every post we are waiting for news from you and signs of life from the new General Council.</p>
<p>Best wishes to Cuno, I hope he will write soon. POOR Hepner has indeed been given 4 weeks gaol because the International is prohibited in Leipzig!</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. Engels

In his speech, Marx accused those who called themselves the British workers' leaders of having more or less sold out to the bourgeoisie and the government. Many sections within the British Federation protested against this decision by the Federal Council.</span>

<li id="cite_note-10"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-10">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">In 1869 Nechayev established contacts with Bakunin and began setting up a secret organisation called Narodnaya Rasprava (The People's Judgment) in a number of Russian cities. Having received from Bakunin the credentials of the 'Alliance révolutionnaire européenne', Nechayev passed himself off as a representative of the International. When members of Nechayev's organisation were arrested and put on trial in St Petersburg in the summer of 1871, the adventurist methods he had used—blackmail, intimidation, deception, etc.—were brought out into the open. The bourgeois press used the Nechayev case to discredit the International.<br>On 22 September 1871 the London Conference charged the General Council to declare publicly that the International Working Men's Association had nothing to do with Nechayev's activities. On October 16 the General Council adopted an appropriate resolution drafted by Marx (see present edition, Vol. 23, p. 23).</span>

The results of the discussion were incorporated into a number of resolutions passed by the Congress, notably into resolutions of Section IV (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 246-48).<br>The official version of the Hague Congress resolutions was written and edited by Marx and Engels, who were on the committee (together with Eugène Dupont, Léo Frankel, Auguste Serraillier and Benjamin Le Moussu) appointed to prepare the Congress minutes and resolutions for publication. The official edition appeared in November 1872 in French as a separate pamphlet; on 14 December 1872,<i> The International Herald,</i> No. 37, carried the official English version.</span>

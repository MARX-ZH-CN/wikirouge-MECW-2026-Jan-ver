MARX TO FERDINAND FREILIGRATH</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 7 February 1861</p>
<p>Dear Freiligrath,</p>
<p>I have so arranged matters with Engels that you can obtain the £30 <i>any day you like,</i> ditto the expenses at 24 hours' notice. The <i>tailleur</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> thus becomes redundant, and I would ask you to let Engels know <i>when</i> he is to send the money.</p>
<p>I shall myself be obliged to go to Holland, since I won't otherwise be able to weather the current crisis. Would you be so good as to inquire from some business friend of yours what the position is in regard to <i>passports</i> in Holland—whether one has to have a passport? The <i>Tribune's</i> 'turpitude', coinciding as it did with other misfortunes, was all the more disastrous for me in that it prevented me from making futher arrangements about my wife's convalescence in accordance with doctor's orders. Although I don't belong to the category of 'German martyrs' and have always been inimical to that category, I nevertheless think I have had my fair share of refugee-trouble.</p>
<p>Besides Lassalle's,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I have received offers of journalistic employ- ment from 2 other quarters in Germany. However—and doubtless you share this view—I don't believe the tide has risen high enough for me to agree to anything of the kind just now.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>You can see what a HUMBUG OLD Ruge is by comparing Engels' <i>Reichsverfassungskampagne</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> in the <i>Revue</i> with the version Arnold has palmed off on you.

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>London, 22 September 1854 Dear Frederic,</p>
<p>Just a few lines in much haste to acknowledge due receipt. Also of your letter ON THE ASIATIC WAR on Tuesday.</p>
<p>I have had some very important dispatches from America which I shall send you with my next letter. <i>Je vous attends</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>ON TUESDAY.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>That fat swine Püttmann has been shipped off from here to Australia as a 'colonist', together with FAMILY.</p>
<p>Ebner has gone mad in Frankfurt. <i>Pauvre diable</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ernest Jones has found a new printer on cheaper terms. Disraeli has written to tell him that he will bring up <i>all</i> Chartist petitions in Parliament.</p>
<p>The cholera epidemic, now much abated, is said to have been particularly severe in our district because *the sewers made in June, July and August, were driven through the pits where those who died of the plague 1668 (? I think) were buried*.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

<blockquote><p>Marx delivered this speech in the General Council on June 28, 1870 to substantiate his resolution on the subject (see <a committee="" committee"="" council="" eneral="" federal="" general="" href="MECW21-040.html" of="" on="" resolution="" romance="" switzerland.="" the="" to="">General Council Resolution on the Federal Committee of Romance Switzerland. The General Council to the Romance Federal Committee</a>). The speech was recorded by Eccarius.</p></blockquote><p>FROM THE MINUTES OF THE GENERAL COUNCIL MEETING OF JUNE 28, 1870</p>
<p>Cit. Marx thought the only thing the Council could do was to leave the Geneva Committee<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> that had helped from the foundation of the Association as it was. It had fulfilled its duty in every respect and had had a larger constituency though fewer delegates than [the] other party at the Swiss Congress.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> The vote admitting the Alliance should also be communicated.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> The new committee could choose some local name.

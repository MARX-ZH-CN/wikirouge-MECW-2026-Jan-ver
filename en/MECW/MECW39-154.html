MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 26 April 1853</p>
<p>DEAR Frederic,</p>
<p>I fear that nothing will come of my proposed trip.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>Bamberger cannot discount the bill for me and Friedländer, who half-promised to do so, has now definitely refused. I have written to Strohn about it,<sup>S79</sup> but look on this as a mere formality which I complied with <i>pour acquit de conscience</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>and for my wife's sake, without expecting anything to come of it.</p>
<p>A paper of mine for the <i>Tribune</i> (which included the <i>first</i> Turkish article)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>about Mazzini's presence here—again denied by his friends but on his orders, I think—was made the basis for a short LEADER on Mazzini's lucky escape, followed by the comment:</p>
<p>"In this connection we may properly pay a tribute to the remarkable ability of the correspondent by whom this interesting piece of intelligence is furnished. Mr Marx has very decided opinions of his own, with some of which we are far from agreeing, but those who do not read his letters neglect one of the most instructive sources of information on the great questions of current European politics."<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>As you see, I am firmly in the saddle. I have in addition had a most interesting letter from Cluss with 2 issues containing Hirsch's confessions<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>(not yet concluded). I'm not sending the stuff yet since there's still a chance that something might happen to enable me to come myself and bring the things with me. Anyhow, I won't come without notifying you beforehand. When is your old man arriving? I'd rather not cannon into him.</p>
<p>If only Dana would advise me of a business house here, as I have asked him three times to do, I should at least be over the worst.</p>
<p><i>Ad vocem</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>Hirsch: Originally I was of the same opinion<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>as yourself, but the matter is somewhat different. Stieber and Goldheim are definitely here, their purpose being to 'link' Kossuth's gunpowder plot with Berlin.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>. The same fellow who wrote me the anonymous scrawl,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>wrote on the same day to Schärttner and Göhringer word-for-word as follows:</p>
<p>'London, 21.4.53 Announcement</p>
<p>Recent arrivals: Police Commissioner Stieber and the Jew Goldheim, a police lieutenant, both of Berlin (P.T.O.)</p>
<p><i>Description</i></p>
<p><i>Stieber</i> Medium height (about 5') Hair: black, short Moustache: ditto, ditto Complexion: sallow and muddy Wears dark, narrow trousers, a sack, a collapsible stuff hat, spectacles.</p>
<p><i>the Jew Goldheim</i></p>
<p>about 6' Hair: black, short Moustache: ditto, ditto Complexion: sallow, puffy features Wears black trousers, a light yellow sack, black hat.</p>
<p>N.B. Both of them regularly go about together and are accompanied by <i>Hirsch</i>, a commercial assistant from Hamburg, and Haering, a postal clerk from Willich's birth-place. Today Stieber and Goldheim had a meeting with Bangya. Stieber and Goldheim visit the Prussian Embassy regularly every day between 11 and 3.'</p>
<p>I believe the author to be Henry de L'Aspée, friend and compatriot of O. Dietz, that same aggrieved policeman who, you will recall, was to have [a meeting] with us after your arrival here for the purpose of making further revelations. You can see what headway 'Hirsch' is making. Nothing could be more inopportune for Willich-Kinkel.</p>
<p>FAREWELL.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>As to the pound,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>I shall give them each 10/-, since so far as I know there's some prospect of Pieper's getting his money without a lawsuit. The poor devil is hellish syphilitic and at the same time in rotten CIRCUMSTANCES and too featherbrained to look after himself.

In March 1853 the Prussian police arrested several liberal and radical bourgeois leaders in Berlin in an effort to trump up a new conspiracy case. These government and police actions are described in Marx's articles 'The Berlin Conspiracy', 'The Berlin Conspiracy.—London Police.—Mazzini.—Radetzky' and Marx's and Engels' article 'The Rocket Affair.—The Swiss Insurrection' (see present edition, Vol. 12)</span>

MARX TO A. von BRÜNINGK</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Rough copy]</p>
<p>[London,] 18 October 1852 28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>To Baron A. von Brüningk</p>
<p>I have received by today's post the <i>Baltimore Wecker</i> dated 27 September 1852, together with your statement. Since I, as <i>one</i> of the correspondents of A. Cluss in Washington, am directly involved in this matter, I would request you to appoint a meeting-place for Thursday or Friday (of this week).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>I for my part shall bring a witness with me and would therefore request you to do likewise, but would point out in advance that the said witness may not be either <i>Ruge</i>, <i>Ronge</i>, <i>Kinkel</i>, or <i>Willich</i>, since these gentlemen are <i>implicated</i> in the matter now pending, nor can it be Mr <i>Schimmelpfennig</i>. When in Paris, that gentleman swore in so many words to 'destroy me by <i>slander</i> of every possible description'. While I do not believe in his destructive ability, I cannot, in view of this assertion, possibly consent to meet him.</p>
<p>I shall then explain to you my connection with the <i>Baltimore</i> article<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>and, should my explanation not suffice, I shall be prepared to give you the satisfaction customary among gentlemen.</p>
<p>Yours truly</p>
<p>Dr Karl Marx

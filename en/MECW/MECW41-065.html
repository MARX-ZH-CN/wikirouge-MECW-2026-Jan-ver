MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 8 May 1860</p>
<p>Dear Frederick,</p>
<p>Reiff is a scoundrel. No one sent him up to Manchester. He disappeared from here after he had been exposed. He was thrown out of the League<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>back in 1850. During the preliminary investigation at the Cologne trial<sup>2</sup> he actually turned traitor. I've just found a letter of Bermbach's which refers to this.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>So, have nothing to do with him.</p>
<p>As to your pamphlet,<sup>1</sup> you'll have found something in Fischel's letter. By the by, in your place I shouldn't hesitate to exploit friend Siebel's minor literary connections (as soon as he's up and about again, that is) for the purpose of combating the <i>conspiration du silence.</i> Had you actually put your name to the pamphlet, the public would have seized upon it, if only out of curiosity. Behrend, by the by, seems to be even worse than Duncker.</p>
<p>Szemere is a man who likes to ask others to do him a service, but who keeps his own pocket-flaps buttoned. You have now done enough for him and, if I were you, I would leave his wine to its <i>mission toute patriotique</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>I don't much care for the SETTLEMENT with G. Ermen. The question is, whether your family is or is not leaving any capital in the business. If the former, it might provide a vantage point from which to negotiate.</p>
<p>From your letter it would appear that you are once again going to cancel or postpone your trip down here. Considering how rapid communications are, you ought really to be able to spare a couple of days.</p>
<p>What do you think of the Sicilian business?</p>
<p>Things in Vienna are said to be very revolutionary. The English are, of course, now plaguing us with talk about Brück. The day before yesterday a chap was again badgering me about it. He asked: 'Now. WHAT DO YOU SAY OF BRUCK'S SUICIDE?' 'I'LL TELL YOU, SIR. IN AUSTRIA THE ROGUES CUT THEIR OWN THROATS, WHILE IN ENGLAND THEY CUT THEIR PEOPLE'S PURSES.'</p>
<p>Borkheim has just written to me from Dublin. He will be arriving in Manchester on Saturday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>evening and will come and see you on Sunday.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">This refers to the <i>Communist League</i>, the first German and international communist organisation of the proletariat, formed under the leadership of Marx and Engels in London early in June 1847 as a result of the reorganisation of the League of the Just. The programme and organisational principles of the Communist League were drawn up with the direct participation of Marx and Engels. League members took an active part in the bourgeois-democratic revolution in Germany in 1848-49. After the defeat of the revolution, the League was reorganised and continued its activities. In the summer of 1850, differences arose between the supporters of Marx and Engels and the sectarian Willich-Schapper group, which tried to impose its adventurist tactics of immediately unleashing a revolution regardless of the existing conditions and practical possibilities. The discord led to a split within the League in September 1850. Because of police persecution and arrests of League members, the activities of the League as an organisation virtually ceased in Germany in May 1851. On 17 November 1852, on a motion by Marx, the League's London District announced the dissolution of the League (see this volume, pp. 72, 82-84).</span>

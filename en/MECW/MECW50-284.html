ENGELS TO VERA ZASULICH</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] Friday 22 March 1895</p>
<p>41 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear citizen Vera,</p>
<p>On Sunday evening we will be without a maid and without a cook. They are both leaving us tomorrow, and therefore the house will be upside down, and in a state which will scarcely permit us to receive our friends—you will therefore, I hope, excuse us for that evening.</p>
<p>Cordial greetings from the Freybergers—we hope that the fine weather will cure you completely.</p>
<p>Sincere good wishes,</p>
<p>F. Engels

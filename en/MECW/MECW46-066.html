MARX TO JENNY LONGUET
<br>IN ARGENTEUIL
<br>[London,] 22 July 1881
<br><i>My dear Jenny,</i>
<br>The doctor<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> has just left Mama, and we shall start on Tuesday or Wednesday next. You will be informed by telegram of the exact day.
<br>Please <i>write at once,</i> because Mama will not get away from London before you have written her which things from London may be required by you. You know she is fond of that sort of commission-business.
<br>I enclose <i>£5,</i> since you will have to pay cash for the hire of bed-linen etc.; the remainder will be paid when I arrive. Only on these terms will I agree to the arrangement you have suggested.
<br>As to the story Hirsch has told you with respect to Lafargue, it is a mere <i>lie.</i> Lafargue, as I was sure from the beginning, has never written anything of the sort to his Paris correspondents.
<br><i>Adio,</i> dear child, with thousand kisses to the children
<br>Old Nick

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN GREAT YARMOUTH</p>
<p>Lausanne, 24.August 1882 Hôtel du Nord</p>
<p>DEAR [Fred],<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Yesterday, on from Dijon to Lausanne,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> wet and relatively cold. Nine o'clock at night arrived at Lausanne in the rain. First ques- tion I asked the waiter: 'How long has it been raining here?' Reply: 'Only been wet for 2 days' (i.e. since the day I left Paris). <i>C'est drôle!</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Today we shall look round in Vevey, Montreux, etc., for some- where to stay. <i>In the meantime</i> write to Lausanne, <i>poste restante.</i> I should like to have a timely supply of extra MUNITION so that some may always be available against any and every eventuality. Address letters to Dr Charles Marx, not Karl Marx.</p>
<p>Longuet remained true to his own self till the day of my departure. For during both my previous visits to Argenteuil,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> Longuet kept promising the translator of <i>Capital,</i> that poor devil Roy, to arrange a meeting with me; on neither occasion was Longuet able to find a suitable time. And on this occasion, when Longuet again started to maunder on about my meeting Roy, I told him he might arrange it at any time during the last 4 weeks. <i>Eh bien!</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> <i>Not until the day of my depar- ture</i> when I had to pack, pay a farewell call on Dr Dourlen and still had a great deal to discuss with Jennychen, etc., does Longuet go off to Paris without my prior knowledge, pick up Roy and bring him back to <i>déjeuner</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> (1 o'clock) in Argenteuil. There was a chilly north- east wind and, as a result of my obligatory CONVERSATION with POOR Roy in the garden, I caught cold. THANKS TO Longuet!</p>
<p>Apropos. A German who is Paris correspondent to a lot of bour- geois German newspapers wrote to me as my most humble and obe- dient servant, saying that, while honesty demanded I should know that he was not a Social Democrat, still less correspondent to newspa- pers ofthat complexion, people in all circles of German 'society' were anxious to have official news of my health; therefore requested TO INTERVIEW me at Argenteuil, etc.</p>
<p>O F COURSE, I DID NOT REPLY TO THAT SOFTSAWDER PENMAN. Love to all.</p>
<p>Moor</p>
<p>I shall go and see OLD Becker<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> and Wrôblewski in Geneva as soon as my cough has eased up again.

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">In May 1877, a congress of the Swiss Workers' Union in Neuenburg accepted Johann Philipp Becker's proposal for a merger with the Grütli-Verein, a petty-bourgeois organisation, to form a single Social-Democratic party. A commission established for the purpose and including members of the two organisations drafted a joint contract and a programme for the Social- Democratic party in Switzerland, which in fact coincided with the Gotha Programme adopted by the German Social-Democrats in 1875. In June 1878, a meeting of the Grütli-Verein deputies in Lucerne rejected the contract and adopted the programme subject to further revision. The planned merger did not take place (see also present edition, Vol. 24, pp. 218-19).</span>

In connection with the elections to the French Chamber of Deputies on 14 October 1877, Buffenoir acted as co-author of the manifesto issued by a group of the so-called autonomous socialists of Paris on 9 October 1877.</span>

MARX TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>[London,] 15 March 1872<br>
33 Rathbone Place, W. C.<br>
(new address of the General Council)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dear Citizen,</p>
<p>I enclose the Resolutions of the General Council (in English and French<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>). The other Council<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>will receive them from Le Moussu.</p>
<p>Eccarius, at the end of the sitting of 12 March, told rhe privately that he would not send the Resolutions to New York and that, at next sitting, he would tender his resignation as Secretary for the United States. As this affair cannot be settled by the General Council before Tuesday next,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>the Resolutions sent by me and Le Moussu, are not signed by a Secretary, the which, considering the form chosen, was not necessary. They will be printed in next week's <i>Eastern Post.</i></p>
<p>During the discussion Eccarius spoke in a spirit most hostile to your Council. He spoke and voted against Resolution III, 2.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>He was moreover offended because, in order to save time, I had not submitted the Resolutions to the subcommittee<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>of which he forms part, but laid them at once before the General Council. As the latter fully approved this proceeding, after my statement of the reasons which had induced me to act as I have done, Eccarius ought to have dropped his personal spleen.</p>
<p>For the <i>private</i> information of your Council I add that M. and Madame Huleck—he is an imbecile and she is <b>une intrigante de bas état</b><i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup></i>—had for a moment slipped into the General Council at a time when most of us were absent, but that, soon after, this worthy couple was forced to withdraw consequent upon their intrigues with the <i>soi-disant Branche Française</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>the which was excluded from the <i>International</i> and denounced by us, in the <i>Marseillaise</i> and the <i>Réveil,</i> on the eve of the plebiscite,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>as <b>une section policière<i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup>."'</i></b><i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup></i></p>
<p>Moreover, these two persons, after their arrival at New York, cooperated in the foundation of a Society hostile to the International and were in constant connection with <i>les beaux restes de la branche française</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup>at London. The same facts have been communicated by Le Moussu to the other Council.</p>
<p>Section 10 (French) has written an excellent letter to the General Council on the American split.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Yours fraternally,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

The resolution moved by George Howell was limited to the expression of sympathies with the French people. To oppose this, Robert Applegarth, a General Council member, moved a resolution that urged the British Government to use all its influence to bring an end to the war between France and Germany and to protest against any dismemberment of France. The resolution also demanded that a peace treaty be concluded on conditions that ensured a lasting peace in Europe. After a prolonged and heated discussion Applegarth's resolution was adopted by a majority of 7 votes.<br>By instructions for Belgium, Marx probably meant his letter to César De Paepe of 14 September 1870 (see this volume, pp. 79-81). Instructions for Switzerland and the United States have not been found.</span>

As a result of the split two committees were formed, the Provisional Federal Council (Committee No. I), which comprised representatives of the 14 sections adhering to the proletarian stand (Friedrich Adolph Sorge, Friedrich Boite, etc.), and the separatist council (Committee No. II), headed by Victoria Woodhull and other bourgeois reformists belonging to Section No. 12. At its meetings of 5 and 12 March the General Council voiced its support for the proletarian wing of the North American Federation; Section No. 12 was suspended from the International pending the next Congress. On 28 May 1872 the General Council declared the Provisional Federal Council the sole leading body of the North American sections. The congress of the North American Federation held in July 1872 elected the standing Federal Council which included all members of the provisional body (see Engels' 'The International in America' and Marx's 'American Split', present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 177-83, 636-43).</span>

It comprised corresponding secretaries for various countries, the General Council Secretary, and its treasurer. The Standing Committee, which had not been envisaged in the Rules of the International Working Men's Association, functioned as a working executive body. In the summer of 1872 the General Council decided to entrust all organisational matters to the Sub-Committee (which in June 1872 was renamed the Executive Committee).<br>As Corresponding Secretary of the General Council for Switzerland, Jung received a large number of letters dealing with the campaign waged by the Romance Federation against the divisive Bakuninist sections; the letters were referred to the Sub-Committee for consideration.</span>

Besides proletarian members (Eugène Dupont, Hermann Jung, Paul Lafargue and others), the Branch also included petty-bourgeois refugees (Victor Le Lubez and later Félix Pyat). In 1868, after the General Council had adopted a resolution proposed by Marx (7 July 1868) condemning Pyat's provocative calls for terrorist acts against Napoleon III (see present edition, Vol. 21, p. 7), a split occurred in the Branch, and its proletarian members resigned. But Pyat's group, having lost virtually all ties with the International, continued to call itself the French Branch in London. It also repeatedly gave support to anti-proletarian elements opposing Marx's line in the General Council. On 10 May 1870 the General Council officially dissociated itself from this group (see present edition, Vol. 21, p. 131).</span>

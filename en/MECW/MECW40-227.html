<p>MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 16 March 1859</p>
<p>DEAR Frederick,</p>
<p><i>£5</i> received. THANKS. Yesterday proof sheet II b arrived. If it goes on like this it'll take them three months. There can't possibly be more than one type-setter employed on this affair.</p>
<p>I don't know what to write about on Friday. Can you do something—on Armstrong's GUN, perhaps?</p>
<p>Mr Bruno Bauer has, I am told, written a pamphlet on the 'question of the day', pro-Russia and France and anti-Austria and England. He is now the ally of Manteuffel, in support of whom he has already written recently in the <i>Zeit.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>I am sending you that CLOWN Edgar Bauer's paper. The man has become a great communist and working men's representative. He and his little rag are almost finished. The first article, 'Zank',<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>is a direct attack on me. I am, it seems, quietly to join up with Mr Edgar and emerge from my 'surly' and 'distrustful' isolation. The CLOWN has turned into a real preacher. He doesn't dare attack the <i>Hermann</i> for fear the fellows may disclose his 'PAST'.</p>
<p>Kinkel's paper is doing excellent business. Prudently, he has quite given up writing himself. The money comes partly from a Dr Juch and partly from the Portuguese Jew, Castello (an old Portuguese financial house), who was talked into it by the great Gerstenberg.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>

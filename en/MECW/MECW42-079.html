<p><i>To Engels in Manchester</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 1 May 1865</b></p>
<p><b>Dear Fred</b>,</p>
<p>You must excuse me for not writing until today and thus breaking <b>my last promise</b>. It happened not because it is 'sheer delight to break one's word', but because I really am <b>overworked</b>, as completing my book [Capital], on the one hand, and the <b>International Association</b> on the other, are making very heavy demands on my time.</p>
<p>Today is little Jenny's birthday, and this evening I shall be having Ernest Jones to my house along with Odger, Cremer, Fox and Jung, so it will be a political birthday party. Laura <b>had 'the question popped'</b> by one Charles Manning, born in South America, English father, Spanish mother. He's rich and generally a nice fellow, <b>but Laura 'does not care a pin for him'. 'She has already known how to damp'</b> the passionate southern temperament. However, as my girl is a friend of his sisters, and he is frightfully <b>in love</b>, it is <b>a disagreeable case</b>.</p>
<p>I enclose <i>a 'curiosity'.</i> The <i>Nordstern's</i> correction makes it a worthy organ of the German louts.</p>
<p>I am also enclosing for <b>you the latter end</b> of a letter from Schily, whose report on the Moses woman will amuse you.</p>
<p>The great achievement of the '<b>International Association'</b> is this:</p>
<p>The <b>Reform League</b> is <b>our work</b>. On the inner committee of 12 (6 <b>middleclassmen</b> and 6 <b>workingmen</b>), the <b>workingmen</b> are <b>all members of our Council</b> (including Eccarius). <b>We have baffled</b> all attempts by the middle class <b>to mislead the working class</b>. This time the movement in the provinces is completely dependent on that in London. Ernest Jones, e.g., had <b>despaired till we set the ball a-going</b>. If we succeed in re-electrifying the <b>political movement</b> of the <b>English working class</b>, our <b>Association</b> will already have done more for the European working class, <b>without making any fuss</b>, than was possible <b>in any other way</b>. And there is every prospect of success.</p>
<p>You know that the <i>Italian</i> society has not withdrawn from the <b>Association</b>, but its <b>delegates</b> have from the <b>Council</b>. We now have <i>Spaniards</i> on it instead. <b>One Roman nation for the other</b>. If those fellows don't appoint new delegates soon, as we have asked them to, Bakunin will have to arrange <b>for some life Italians</b>.</p>
<p><i>Weber junior</i> has been thrown out of the workers' society here for making false reports to the <i>Social-Demokrat</i> and for stirring up trouble in the branch society 'Teutonia', which is run by two fanatical Prussians by the name of Klinker.</p>
<p>Our joint statement really was successful beyond all expectation. Not merely have we blown apart the 'General Association of German Workers' as an organ of the Prussian government and in <b>six words</b> generally cleared the heads of the German workers of their intoxication with royalty. The present <i>split in the Party of Progress</i> was also the direct result of our stand.</p>
<p>The <b>chivalry of the South</b> has ended worthily. In addition, Lincoln's <b>assassination</b> was the most stupid act they could have committed. <i>Johnson is</i> <b>stern, inflexible, revengeful</b> and as a former <b>poor White</b> has a deadly hatred of the oligarchy. He will make less fuss about these fellows, and, because of the treachery, he will find the <b>temper</b> of the North commensurate with his <b>intentions</b>.</p>
<p>Did you see how Blind <b>heads</b> the letter of condolence from the 'influential' Germans? Blind is a genius in his way. <b>In the very nick of time</b> he does not merely go running to Freiligrath, etc., but has enough presence of mind to realise that, of the other signatories, <b>alphabetically</b> 'Berndes' would open the list. So, he runs first to Freiligrath, etc., and gets him first of all to form a group and, after that worthy (who is now at one with Ruge as well), certain other <b>influentials</b>, I almost said <b>infinitesimals</b>, such as Heintzmann and Kinkel, and puts himself 'alphabetically' at the top. Then he goes running to Berndes and gets him to start a second column next to himself, so that another lot of names, Trübner, etc., follows on. That is how the matter appears in <i>The Times.</i> In the same day's <i>Morning Star</i> the second column is added to the bottom of the first, with Blind <b>at the top of the whole, and his footman</b> Freiligrath after him, etc. And not content with that, at his instigation, the <i>Star</i> of the same number also carries a notice on the front page <b>that 'Karl Blind heads, etc.'.</b></p>
<p>Isn't that genius for you?</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.

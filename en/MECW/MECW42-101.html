MARX TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT</p>
<p>IN LEIPZIG</p>
<p>[London,] 20 September 1865</p>
<p>Dear Miller,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>I received yours yesterday afternoon, too late to post a letter here. <i>Illness</i> had much to do with my protracted silence. There were other reasons which I think useless now to dwell upon. Much business pressing upon my time just now, I can only return these few lines.</p>
<p>A <i>Report</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>(English, of course) on your part is very important. It must be here on Monday next (25 September). It cannot arrive timely unless you send me the letter <i>directly</i> by the Leipzig post.</p>
<p>The Swiss have chosen two delegates, Mons Dupleix, a Frenchman, and Mr <i>Philipp Becker,</i> a German.</p>
<p>Old Hatzfeldt dwells at Paris, where the old hag is intriguing with the 'horn-bearing' father of 'Socialism', <i>Moses,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>her most cringing slave. It was at her instigation, that he inserted his 'warning' in the <i>Nordstern</i> and his slander into the <i>Social-Demokrat.</i><sup>2iS</sup> She is now concocting with him the 'Apotheosis' of her own belated 'Oedipus'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>The London correspondent of the <i>Social-Demokrat</i> seems to be cracked Weber.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>All these things have been reported to me from Paris. As to myself, I carefully abstain from taking any notice whatever of what is going on in the Berlin and Hamburg 'organs' of the movement.<sup>0</sup> This so-called movement is so disgusting a thing that the less you hear of it the better.</p>
<p>We have founded here a <i>weekly</i> paper of our own <i>The Workman's Advocate.</i> You will oblige by sending correspondence (English) for it to my address.</p>
<p>Yours truly</p>
<p>A. Williams<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">On 15 September 1865 Liebknecht wrote to Marx that he could not go to the London Conference of the International because of urgent matters and the removal of his family to Leipzig, but promised him to send a report on the working-class movement in Germany. This report was sent to Marx on 23 September but Marx did not read it out at the conference because, he believed, it said too much about his personal services (see Marx's letter to Liebknecht of 21 November 1865, this volume, pp. 201-03).</span>

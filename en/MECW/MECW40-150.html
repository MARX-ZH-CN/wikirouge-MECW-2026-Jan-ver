ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester,] 11 March 1858</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Herewith something on 'Beresford' which I've been able to abstract from Napier.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>I couldn't find anything about his expedition to Buenos Aires at the beginning of the century, but it was a glorious one and would be worth investigating. He capitulated, RUMP AND STUMP, with the whole English force.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>'Bülow' is IN HAND. Ditto 'Cavalry'. Still some particulars to be looked up on 'Bomarsund'. In India there's another article brewing for which I shall be on the <i>qui vive.</i></p>
<p>Charras' <i>Campagne de 1815</i> is no longer obtainable in Brussels; said to be out of print and with no definite prospect of a reprint. In other words, Bonaparte has bought the publisher.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>If you can run to ground a cheap (i. e. not exorbitant) copy in London, I'd like you to let me know; just now I'm studying this campaign.</p>
<p>I suspect that friend Dana is abridging our articles considerably, otherwise you couldn't possibly have miscalculated so badly. Go to Trübner's some time and have a look at the <i>Cyclopaedia.</i></p>
<p>No news here, except that it's a ghastly winter; the weather changes I don't know how many times a day. Health very good. Am also taking iron.</p>
<p>Warm regards to your wife and children.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p>A bundle of <i>Guardians</i> goes off today. As often as not there's nothing from their foreign correspondents just now. In today's more statistics on the UNEMPLOYED.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>

Meeting with no serious resistance from the Spanish  colonial authorities, Beresford's force seized Buenos Aires but was surrounded  and compelled to surrender by the Argentine patriots.—285</span>

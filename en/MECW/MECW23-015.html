<br>On page 2 of the Frankfurter Zeitung, No. 326, is a report, dated London, November 18, which runs as follows:
<br>"At its last meeting the London section of the International passed the following resolution: 'The outstanding services of Sir Charles Dilke to the people's cause give him the right to recognition by the people; therefore he is invited to accept the title of honorary member of the international working men's union.' At an earlier meeting Kossuth was elected member."
<br>The International does not recognise any honorary membership. In all probability the above-mentioned decision relates to a small London society, which first called itself "The International Democratic Association" and later changed its name to the "Universal Republican League".<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> It has no connection whatsoever with the International.
<br>In the name of the General Council of the International Working Men's Association
<br>Corresponding Secretary for Germany,
<br><i><b>Karl Marx</b></i>

Its leaders included bourgeois radical Charles Bradlaugh, trade-unionist. George Odger, petty-bourgeois journalists Victor Le Lubez, Pierre Vesinier and others. The League put forward a mixed programme in which democratic demands (the nationalisation of the land, universal suffrage) were placed side by side with a call for the establishment of a world federative republic. The League's activists claimed leadership in the international working-class movement and, together with other anti-Marxist elements, waged a struggle against the General Council of the International.</span>

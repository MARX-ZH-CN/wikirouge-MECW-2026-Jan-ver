ENGELS TO JENNY MARX (DAUGHTER)</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 8 August 1869</p>
<p>Dear Jenny,</p>
<p>I have received Lizzie's orders to thank you, in her name, for the very handsome and very considerate present you made her in the volume of Moore's <i>Irish Melodies</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>You could not have made her a greater pleasure. She knows, from her childhood, most of the tunes, but scarcely one of them completely, and so now she can refresh her rather broken-down memory from the book.</p>
<p>Next Sunday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>there is to be a grand Irish concert in which the whole Fenian and non-Fenian company, convicted and uncon- victed, will have to join. I only regret that the whole musical talent of our house will be unable to take full advantage of the book when Tussy will have left us; but then, Mary Ellen <i>will</i> have to learn as much as is required for that.</p>
<p>When are you and Moor going to Holland and Germany<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>? I have now, at last, made my arrangements. I shall have to be in Ostend on the evening of the 17th or morning of the 18th August and intend to stay there for about a week.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>Probably I shall come over to London on Monday the 16th and spend a day with you, and to see whether I cannot make arrangements to meet you and Moor somewhere in Germany. If not, I shall very likely come straight home again from Ostend. I hope, however, that you will, in the meantime, bring your plans to some state of maturity so as to enable us to have a bottle of hock together in its native country. With kind regards to Moor and your Mama, I remain</p>
<p>Yours faithfully</p>
<p>F. Engels

MARX TO CARLO CAFIERO<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN NAPLES [Draft]</p>
<p>London, 29 July 1879<br>
41 Maitland Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Citizen,</p>
<p>My sincerest thanks for the two copies of your work!<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Some time ago I received two similar works, one written in Serbian,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> the other in English (published in the United States),<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> but both of them err in that, by seeking to provide a succinct and popular résumé of <i>Capital,</i> they also devote themselves in too pedantic a manner to the scientific <i>form</i> of the argument. Thus it seems to me that they more or less lose sight of their principal object, which is to make an impression on the public for whom these résumés are intended. And it is here that your work is vastly superior!</p>
<p>As to the concept of the <i>thing,</i> I believe I am not mistaken when I find an apparent gap in the views set out in your preface, which is that there is no proof that the <i>material conditions</i> indispensable to the emancipation of the proletariat are engendered in spontaneous fashion by the progress of capitalist production.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Moreover, I share your opinion—if I have interpreted your preface aright—that one ought not to overload the minds of the people one is proposing to educate. There is nothing to prevent your making, at the right moment, a further attempt aimed at placing greater emphasis on this materialist basis of <i>Capital.</i></p>
<p>Once again many thanks.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

MARX TO FRANZ DUNCKER</p>
<p>IN BERLIN</p>
<p>Manchester,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> 22 June [1859]</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I would request you to send the balance of the fee for my book<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>without delay</i> to my wife in London.</p>
<p>In the letter you wrote me at the end of May<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> you said that the book would come out and the fee be paid '<i>next week'.</i> Neither the one nor the other was done until today, 22 June. Your principle would seem to be that a 'strictly scientific work' can never come out too late and, more particularly, that one should wait until such time as the general spread of the war 37° has stimulated a 'strictly scientific' interest.</p>
<p>The same circumstances as have induced you to sanction this further postponement might, perhaps, justify a postponement until 1860, particularly in view of what you say in your letter, namely that, in the case of scientific works <i>in respect of which there is no undertaking as to the time of publication,</i> it is customary for German publishers to place an embargo on their appearance in favour of topical works whenever this would seem to be opportune.</p>
<p>Since it is impossible for me to reply privately to the many inquiries I receive—in connection with these delays—I shall, after waiting a few days longer, issue a <i>public statement.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Yours very faithfully,</p>
<p>Dr K. Marx

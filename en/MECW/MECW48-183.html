ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>AT LE PERREUX</p>
<p>London, 2 May 1889</p>
<p>My dear Lafargue,</p>
<p>Now things are beginning to move. This is what Bebel writes:</p>
<p>'Liebknecht and I have agreed that Lafargue and his friends should be urged to convene a congress immediately for 14 July. This we are doing in the conviction that, once the two congresses have met on the same day, it will prove impossible for them to hold separate sessions, and that they will join forces, whether the Possibilists like it or not.</p>
<p>I think you people should now be satisfied. As soon as the convocation circular is published by the French, we shall issue an open appeal to the Germans, asking them to elect delegates to the congress and indicating the procedure by which this may be done' (under German law). 'I have written in the same vein to the Austrians, and the Danes and Swiss will likewise be notified. In this way we shall, I hope, manage to expropriate the Possibilists—or at any rate well and truly thwart their plan.'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>4.30 p.m. I am just back from Bernstein's who, however, was not at home. He has had a postcard from Liebknecht in which the latter says that you are at liberty to make use of 'their names' as having assented to your congress. 'Their names' presumably means Bebel and Liebknecht, for they are not as yet <i>officially</i> entitled to commit the German Party. I didn't see the card but Bonnier, who dropped in while I was out, told Nim about it.</p>
<p>I hope to get a few lines from you tomorrow morning which would enable me to rekindle Bebel's ardour by telling him that you are now taking action.</p>
<p>Don't forget, by the bye, to return to me, deciphered, the letter from Lyons.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> I must not keep the workmen there waiting for an answer.</p>
<p>Now that you've got several provincial papers, choose one to be your <i>Monitor</i> for the duration of your congress and arrange for it to be sent to the various Parties, along with all your publications.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> Below you will find some of the addresses. The rest will follow.</p>
<p>Give Laura a kiss from me. I shall write to her as soon as this bally congress ceases to monopolise my right hand.</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>F. E.</p>

<p>The (German)<sup>3</sup> Americans although pressed by the Possibilists and Hyndman have said that it is you they still favour, and not the Possibilists. If they get your circular in time, I have no doubt they will give their assent, but they will go to <i>some</i> congress or other. <i>Arbejderen</i> is the radical opposition paper run by Petersen (who was acquainted with Rouannet and Malon in Paris, but has changed greatly since then) and by Trier, translator of my <i>Origin of the Family.</i> For tactical reasons you would be well-advised not to send them anything that is not simultaneously dispatched to the <i>Socialdemokraten,</i> organ of the moderate majority.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The address of P. Christensen, delegate to London (a good one)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> is 9 Römersgade, Copenhagen.</p>

At the Jolimont congress<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> the Ghent people declared that they would not attend the congress of the Possibilists so long as the latter persisted in their claims. The report in the <i>Prolétariat</i> is riddled with Possibilist lies.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> </p>

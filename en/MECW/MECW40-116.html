<br><i>To Engels in Manchester</i>
<br><b>[London,] 18 December 1857</b>
<br><b>Dear</b> Frederick,
<br>Just a few lines written in great haste. I've just received a <em>3rd and final warning</em> from the rotten rate collector to the effect that, if I haven't paid by Monday, they'll put a <b>broker</b> in the house on Monday afternoon. <b>If</b> possible, <b>therefore</b>, send me a few pounds before Monday. Financial <b>pressure</b> is now even greater than is <b>usually</b> the case with me because, for <b>about</b> 3 weeks, I have had to pay for everything <em>in cash</em> and <b>anything like credit</b> has ceased, while at the same time 2/3 of all the money I receive immediately goes to meet floating <b>debts</b>. Moreover, there is only a very little coming in, since I have hitherto been unable to send the <em>Tribune</em> more than one article. <b>So far as to private matters</b>.
<br>I am working enormously, as a rule until 4 o'clock in the morning. I am engaged on a twofold task: 1. Elaborating the outlines of political economy [Marx had begun work on <em>The Grundrisse</em> — "Outline" — in October 1857 and completed it in May 1858]. (For the benefit of the public it is absolutely essential to go into the matter <em>au fond</em> [thoroughly]<em>,</em> as it is for my own, <b>individually, to get rid of this nightmare</b>.)
<br>2. The <em>present crisis</em>. Apart from the articles for the <em>Tribune</em>, all I do is keep records of it, which, however, takes up a considerable amount of time. I think that, somewhere <b>about</b> the spring, we ought to do a pamphlet <em>together</em> about the affair as a reminder to the German public that we are still there as always, and <b>always the same</b>. I have started 3 large record books — <b>England, Germany, France</b>. All the material on the American affair is available in the <em>Tribune</em>, and can be collated subsequently. By the by, I should be glad if you would send me the <em>Guardian</em> if possible, <em>every day</em>. It not only doubles the work but also disrupts it if I have to deal with a week or so's arrears all at once.
<br>In France, and specially at <em>Havre</em>, the fun (commercial) will probably be started by the 'Germans', whom one cannot altogether help taking into account now. Moreover — apart from the <b>general round</b> of the bankrupt State — trade itself would seem to be exceptionally rotten in Marseilles and Bordeaux, everywhere, that is, where infiltration and intervention by foreign elements has stung the beastly <em>crapauds</em> out of their lousy, mean penny-pinching and <b>timidity</b>. <em>Au fond</em>, only in such an immobile country was a Crédit mobilier both possible and inevitable. <b>The more you become acquainted with the Messiahs of nations, the less you like him</b>.
<br>Write to me whenever you have the time, for later on you're sure to forget all the '<em>chronique scandaleuse</em>' of the crisis which is so invaluable to us. I make excerpts from your letters and enter them in the principal record books.
<br><em>Salut</em>. Kind regards to Lupus. Pieper has the satisfaction of knowing that his ex-principal Saalfeld, with whose wife he had such a tremendous row, <b>has gone to the wall</b>.
<br>Your<br>K. M.

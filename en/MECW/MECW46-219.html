ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>London, 14 December 1882</p>
<p>My dear Laura,</p>
<p>I received your letter last night at half past nine, too late even to send a line by this morning's post, as foreign letters posted up here after nine are not forwarded until next evening.</p>
<p>I had scarcely any money in the house, and had given Percy<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> a cheque to cash for me today in town. But he will not be here before six at best, also too late to send you a banknote by 5.30 mail. However as soon as I get the money I shall forward one so as to help you over the first few days. No doubt Paul<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> will fare as Guesde and Bazin did and be at liberty if not to-day, at least to-morrow, as soon as the comedy of an examination before the austere Piquand shall have been gone through. I forwarded both Paul's and your letter to Mohr, and told Nim<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> about the affair this morning.</p>
<p>More anon, when I shall be able to send substantial comfort.</p>
<p>Yours affectionately,</p>
<p>F. Engels

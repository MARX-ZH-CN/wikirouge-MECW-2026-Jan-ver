ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>Manchester, 14 April 1869 
<br>Dear Moor,
<br>Enclosed the Solingen letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> returned, which is also significant because it clarifies Liebknecht's boasts about the 'establishment of associations in Solingen and Bourscheid'. The one in Solingen was already there,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and the Solingen people established the one in Bourscheid.
<br>The article on the Cretan insurrection<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> in <i>The Diplomatic Review</i> is the best thing they have published for a long time; ditto Urquhart's letter to Fuad Pasha.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> But, as always, the source is not given for Brunnow's statement in the Greek dispatch,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> i.e., 'The "Eastern Question" Closed. Summary from the Blue-Books', <i>The Diplomatic Review,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> whether this dispatch is published in one of the official publications, which is not easy to believe (unless a Greek book), or whether it found its way into Urquhart's hands along private channels. It would be interesting to know this, in case it is quoted later. The statement coincides completely with my constant claim that Russia will not unleash a war before 2 railways are completed to the Black Sea and the Pruth. They are now building like mad, and borrowing money like crazy—in the past 3 years—about £47,000,000! A major part of this represents the future costs of war.
<br>However, in the light of these negotiations, Beust appears to be the Austrian Palmerston, and here too there could be a motive that would favour a speed-up of the action.
<br>Doesn't Eichhoff still send you the <i>Social-Demokrat?</i> It would be very important to see how Schweitzer is conducting himself at the moment in his own paper.
<br>You will have read the article about Lassalle in the <i>Fortnightly,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> and will have seen that you are regarded therein as the real papa of Lassallean and other socialism. Who is this Ludlow? If he could be prevailed upon to write an article in the <i>Fortnightly</i> about your book,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> this would be better than nothing after all.— Congreve's reply to Huxley is the DULLEST, most stupid and most confused thing I have ever seen<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> ; if this is the supreme wisdom of the Comtists, they can let themselves be buried without further ado.
<br>I still must not strain my eye too much, and I feel it a little again today, since I read too much by lamplight yesterday evening; so I am closing. On Saturday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> we received a very jolly letter from Tussy.
<br>Best greetings to your wife and Jenny.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The Solingen Section of the International was set up in February-March 1866. Its members were in touch with the Central Committee of the German-language sections in Geneva and applied for assistance to the General Council and to Marx and Engels personally. The most active members of the Section, including Klein and Moll, took part in the International's congresses. In the autumn of 1867, this Section initiated the establishment of a cooperative of workers engaged in the production of steel and iron goods; it played a major part in the work of the Section (the Rules of the cooperative were drawn up by J. Ph. Becker).</span>

<li id="cite_note-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-3">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">In the summer of 1866, the Greek population of Crete rebelled against Turkish rule demanding that the island be incorporated into Greece. Turkish troops undertook harsh punitive measures against the rebels and the island's civilian population. However, supported by volunteers from many countries, the insurgents carried on their struggle.<br>The events in Crete provoked a fresh exacerbation of international contradictions in the Balkans. In November 1866 the Russian tsarist authorities suggested that the European powers should urge the Turkish Empire to hand Crete over to Greece. However, fearing that Russia would further consolidate its position in the region and that the national liberation movements of the peoples under the Sultan would mount, the Western states preferred Crete to remain under Turkish rule. Support for the Cretan insurgents was confined to a joint statement by Russia, France, Italy and Prussia on 29 October 1867. It advised the Turkish Government to refrain from bloodshed on the island. The conference convened by the European states in Paris in January 1869 to settle the Turkish-Greek conflict forced Greece to discontinue support for the uprising, thereby hastening its defeat. In 1869, the uprising was suppressed.</br></span>

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 27 August 1860</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>You can attribute my long silence to the persistently frightful state of my liver, as a result of which I have to devote every spare moment to work.</p>
<p>I wrote to Siebel <i>re</i> publishers ABOUT ten days ago<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>and await his reply. The long delay is due partly to my relative inability to work and partly to the fact that it was not till recently that I had all the available material. By the by, I believe that, with the exception of the Italian affair<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>(Austria's craving for intervention was a Bonapartist figment), nothing more is going to happen this year (write SOMETHING about Garibaldi. What do you think of Bangya's friend Türr?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>), so there'll be an interim period during which pamphlets of this kind will still be readable.</p>
<p>The enclosed letter from Schily will tickle you very much. <i>Let me have it back.</i> Today I sent Schily your <i>Nice, Savoy, etc.</i></p>
<p>ABOUT a fortnight ago I sent Dr Zimmermann (formerly chairman of a Prussian Municipal Court) a letter, in which I put to. him questions relating to my case (questions of form).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>However, he deemed it necessary to confer with other brethren of the same craft in Berlin. No doubt I shall get his written opinion in the course of this week. I shan't allow the Prussians to get off so lightly.</p>
<p>I'm in a great fix over money. Mr Weydemeyer's journal<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>is already at an end; i.e. he has resigned from the editorial board and intends to go to New York as a SURVEYOR. However, his colleague<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>is going to make the paper pay by <i>selling</i> it to a political party. Weydemeyer has at last come to realise that he's too honest for American journalism.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>How's business in Manchester? India? HOME MARKET?

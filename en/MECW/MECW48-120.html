ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>London, 11 July 1888</p>
<p>Dear Sorge,</p>
<p>In great haste a piece of news which, however, you must keep <i>absolutely secret.</i> Don't be surprised to see me suddenly turn up about the middle of August or a few days after that—I may be taking a quick trip across the ocean.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Could you please let me know by <i>return</i> where you lie, so that I can look you up or, should you happen not to be at home at the time, <i>where</i> you are to be found? Also whether the Wischnewetzkys will be in New York at the time. I shall not see anyone else when I come over, for I have no wish to fall into the hands of the worthy German Socialists—which is why the thing has got to be kept secret. If I do come, I shall not come alone but with the Avelings, who have business over there. More anon.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

They journeyed from New York to Boston and nearby towns, then on to the Niagara Falls and across Lake Ontario to Canada. Engels made this tour incognito, without meeting German Socialists or representatives of the press.</span>

MARX TO G. JULIAN HARNEY</p>
<p>IN BOSTON</p>
<p>London, 21 January 1871
1 a Maitland Park Road, Haverstock Hill, N.W.</p>
<p>Dear Harney,</p>
<p>I want for the second volume of my <i>Criticism of Political Economy</i> documents on the disposal of public lands in the United States since the beginning of the Civil War.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Mr S. Meyer, a friend of mine at New York, has advised me to address myself to Mr Wilson, Commissioner of the General Land Office, Washington. As I am not at all acquainted with the form in which this ought to be done, I address myself to you. Perhaps, you will act as my negotiator.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In spring, there will be offered a second edition in Germany of the first volume of my work.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> A Russian translation at St Petersburg has been stopped by the Moscovite police,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> a French edition at Paris by the war.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> An <b>homme de lettres</b><i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> </i> at New York proposed me preparing an English translation for the United States<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> but I declined the offer since he seemed to me not a competent man for the task.</p>
<p>By our International Council<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> we have stirred the English working class and provoked numerous demonstrations in favour of the French Republic<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> and against the policy of unctuous Gladstone, who has become a servile tool in the hands of the granddaughter of George III and the mother-in-law of 'Fritz'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately, some of the leading workmen—like Mr Mottershead, an old Chartist and a member of our Council—have been bought up by the Peace Society.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> They can do no harm at London but they <i>do</i> in the provinces.</p>
<p>The Trades' Councils at Manchester and Birmingham have lately become active agents of the General Council of the 'International'. At London I regret saying, most of the workmen's representatives use their position in our council only as a means of furthering their own petty personal aims. To get into the House of Commons by hook or by crook, is their <i>ultima Thule</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> and they like nothing better than rubbing elbows with the lords and M.P.'s by whom they are petted and demoralised.</p>
<p>The state of things in Germany you may judge from my letter to <i>The Daily News</i> which I enclose.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Mrs Marx and F. Engels send you their best compliments. <i>Salut et fraternité.</i></p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

Despite its heroic resistance the Roman Republic was overthrown and Rome occupied by French troops.</span>

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Marx is referring to his work on the third book of <i>Capital,</i> which was, with the second book, to form Volume II of <i>Capital</i> (see also Note 219). Marx planned to make a special study of agrarian relations in the United States in connection with his examination of the origin of rent. The <i>American Civil War</i> (1861-65) was caused mainly by the struggle between two social systems—the capitalist system of wage labour in the North and the slave system in the South. Workers, farmers and the Black population played a decisive role in the defeat of the slave-owners of the South and the conclusion of the war in favour of the North.</span>

<li id="cite_note-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-3">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">In early February 1871, at Marx's request, Harney sent a written inquiry to the General Land Office in Washington (see <i>The Harney Papers.</i> Ed. by F. G. Black and R. M. Black, Van Gorcum and Co., Assen, 1969, pp. 267-69).</span>

While preparing this edition Marx partly revised the text and introduced some changes in its structure.</span>
</li>
<li id="cite_note-5"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-5">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Volume I of <i>Capital</i> was translated into Russian by Hermann Lopatin, Nikolai Danielson and Nikolai Lyubavin. It was the first translation of his work into any foreign language. The book was published in full in the spring of 1872 except for the portrait of Marx, because the censor had forbidden its reproduction in the Russian edition.</span>

The first French edition appeared in separate instalments between 1872 and 1875 in a translation by Joseph Roy. Roy's translation being too literal, Marx virtually retranslated the whole book, introducing changes as against the second German edition.</span>

The English translation of Volume I of <i>Capital,</i> edited by Engels, was published in London in 1887; half of the printed copies were distributed in the USA. Later the London edition was reprinted in New York.</span>

The Society, which was actively supported by the Free Traders, donated £20 for the dissemination of the 'First Address of the General Council of the International Working Men's Association on the Franco-Prussian War'. Johann Philipp Becker used this money in Switzerland to have 30,000 copies of the Address printed in German and French. At a meeting of the General Council on 2 August 1870, John Weston, who acted as chairman, announced that John Stuart Mill had commended the Address.</span>

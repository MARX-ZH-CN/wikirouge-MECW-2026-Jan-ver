<p>Harburg, 6 May [1849]</p>
<p>To Dr. Stifft in Vienna</p>
<p>Dear Stifft,</p>
<p><i>Post tot discrimina rerum</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I am glad to have an opportunity of reminding you of my existence. Each new number of the Vienna paper<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> gives me the real satisfaction of knowing beyond doubt that you have not been swallowed up by the counter-revolutionary monster.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> I trust that we shall yet find ourselves seated side by side at a convention.</p>
<p>The bearer, Bruhn, is one of my best friends and a proficient, active revolutionary. I recommend him to you most highly.</p>
<p>Yours</p>
<p>K. Marx

Marx made Andreas Stiftt's acquaintance in August 1848 during his visit to Vienna (*), where he made a speech at a meeting of the Democratic Society and delivered a report and a lecture at the Vienna Workers' Society. Stiftt was member of both these organisations and a contributor to the Neue Rheinische Zeitung.<br>(*) The discontent of the bourgeois shareholders over the political fine of the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> grew particularly strong after it defended the June proletarian insurgents in Paris. — These shareholders refused to finance arid support the newspaper any longer. So in August arid September 1848 Marx made a trip to Berlin and Vienna to raise funds for the further publication of the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i>. Wladislaw Kóscielski gave him about 2,000 talers on behalf of the Polish democrats.<br>The interruption in publication caused by the state of siege in Cologne aggravated the newspaper's financial position. Marx was practically compelled to take upon himself most of the expenses arid he spent his share of the inheritance front his father — about 7,000 talers — to purchase an expensive quick printing press.</span>

<p>One night, my carriage bore me all alone<br>Across that well-known German territory<br>Where many a heart, by power beaten down,<br>Rages in impotent and blazing fury.</p>
<p>In fury that the freedom bought so dear<br>With struggle and with ceaseless vigilance<br>Had been cast out, for venal tongues to jeer<br>And cavil at with cruel insolence.</p>
<p>A mist lay on the meadows, deep and calm.<br>At times, a gust of wind would smite amain<br>The poplar-trees and they, in quick alarm<br>Aroused from sleep, soon slumbered on again.</p>
<p>Clear was the air. Sharp hung the sickle moon,<br>A sword of Damocles above the town<br>Towards which I sped.<br>The wrath of kings flies soon<br>From far away to strike its victims down.</p>
<p>Around the carriage wheels run leaping packs<br>Of dogs that bark at me.<br>And do they howl just like the Capital's paid writer-hacks,<br>Having caught wind of my free-thinking soul?</p>
<p>What do I care? Sunk in my cushions low,<br>I live in dreams of many brave tomorrows.<br>Make no mistake — just before dawn, we know,<br>The nightmare plumbs the deepest of its horrors.</p>
<p>Yes, morning comes at last in silence stealing.<br>A single star shines forth to light its way.<br>The pious wake to bells of freedom pealing —<br>No tocsin now, but peace this joyful day!</p>
<p>The spirit's tree has coiled its root-limbs round<br>The past, to crush all things outworn and old,<br>And now its branches strew the world around<br>With shining blossoms of eternal gold!</p>
<p>And so I slept, and woke that morning after,<br>And saw the earth all happy, cleansed and bright,<br>And <i>Stüve's</i> city [Osnabrack, whose burgomaster was Johann Karl Bertram Stüve ]filled with joy and laughter,<br>City of Freedom, bathed in morning light.</p>
<p><br>
Friedrich Oswald

ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY</p>
<p>IN VIENNA</p>
<p>[London, 9 December 1884]</p>
<p>Dear Kautsky,</p>
<p>It goes without saying that you can have your letters addressed to 122 Regent's Park Road as often and for as long as you wish. I hope this will still catch you in Vienna; in my haste I had overlooked your inquiry and for the past week I have had many interruptions.</p>
<p>Why you and the others do not settle the matter of the 'Speech'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>when you yourselves are certainly better able to decide such matters than I am, is more than I can understand. I am writing to Dietz to tell him to attend to it himself.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

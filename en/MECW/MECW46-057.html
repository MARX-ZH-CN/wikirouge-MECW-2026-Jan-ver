<br>41, Maitland Park Road London N.W. June 2, 1881.
<br><em>Dear Mr. Swinton:</em>
<br>I need hardly recommend you the bearer of these lines, my excellent friend Mr. Hartmann. I send you through him a photogram of mine; it is rather bad, but the only one left to me.
<br>As to the book of Mr. Henry George, I consider it as a last attempt — to save the capitalistic regime. Of course, this is not the meaning of the author, but the older disciples of Ricardo — the radical ones — fancied already that by the public appropriation of the rent of land everything would be righted. I have referred to this doctrine in the <em>Misère de la Philosophie</em> (published in 1847, against Proudhon).
<br>Mrs. Marx sends you her best compliments. Unfortunately her illness assumes more and more a fatal character.
<br>Believe me, dear Sir,
<br>Yours most sincerely,<br>Karl Marx
<br>The "Viereck" was so stultified at his arrival in the U.S. that he confounded my friend Engels with myself, and transformed my compliments to you in those of Engels; he did the same with regard to another American friend of mind by whose letter I was informed of the quid pro quo.

MARX TO FERDINAND LASSALLE
<br>IN PARIS
<br>London, 28 July 1855 28 Dean Street, Soho<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>Dear Lassalle,
<br>I have been staying in the country for the past few weeks in a cottage lent me by a friend<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> who is away in Scotland. That is why I did not get your letter until yesterday. I have, incidentally, taken steps to have my letters forwarded to me immediately from town.
<br>I am, of course, surprised to hear that, despite your proximity to London, you are not thinking of coming over here, if only for a few days. I hope that you will think it over again and discover how short and cheap the journey from Paris to London is. If France's doors were not hermetically closed against me, I would pay you a surprise visit in Paris.
<br>I have several friends in Paris, but I shall not be able to send you their addresses (I am not in town at the moment of writing) until I go to Soho, where I keep them.
<br>Bacon says that really important people have so many relations to nature and the world, so many objects of interest, that they easily get over any loss. I am not one of those important people. The death of my child has shattered me to the very core and I feel the loss as keenly as on the first day. My poor wife is also completely BROKEN DOWN.
<br>If you see Heine again, give him my regards.
<br>Your
<br>K. M.

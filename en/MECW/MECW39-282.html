MARX TO FERDINAND LASSALLE</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>London, 28 July 1855 28 Dean Street, Soho<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dear Lassalle,</p>
<p>I have been staying in the country for the past few weeks in a cottage lent me by a friend<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> who is away in Scotland. That is why I did not get your letter until yesterday. I have, incidentally, taken steps to have my letters forwarded to me immediately from town.</p>
<p>I am, of course, surprised to hear that, despite your proximity to London, you are not thinking of coming over here, if only for a few days. I hope that you will think it over again and discover how short and cheap the journey from Paris to London is. If France's doors were not hermetically closed against me, I would pay you a surprise visit in Paris.</p>
<p>I have several friends in Paris, but I shall not be able to send you their addresses (I am not in town at the moment of writing) until I go to Soho, where I keep them.</p>
<p>Bacon says that really important people have so many relations to nature and the world, so many objects of interest, that they easily get over any loss. I am not one of those important people. The death of my child has shattered me to the very core and I feel the loss as keenly as on the first day. My poor wife is also completely BROKEN DOWN.</p>
<p>If you see Heine again, give him my regards.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

<blockquote>
<p>Engels wrote down this note having learnt about the intention of the Austrian Social Democrats to turn their weekly Arbeiter-Zeitung into a daily. Engels approved this plan and did his best to help carry it through. On December 14, 1894 he wrote to Victor Adler that in London a group of people standing outside the party were ready to let the Arbeiter-Zeitung have about 5,000 florins on condition that Adler would have been "given the leading position "(see present edition, Vol. 50). Engels also arranged for the royalties for his works published by the Dietz Verlag in Stuttgart to be transferred to Victor Adler to cover the needs of the Austrian Social Democrats. Engels tried to get prominent members of the working-class movement in other countries to contribute to the paper and himself wrote a number of articles for it. He wrote a special greeting to the Austrian workers on the publication of the first issue of the daily Arbeiter-Zeitung on January 1, 1895 (see this volume, p. 505)

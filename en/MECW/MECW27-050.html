<blockquote>
<br>Engels wrote this message of greetings in response to the invitation to take part in the 25th anniversary celebrations of the Vienna Workers ' Educational Association (founded on December 15, 1867) sent by the Association's board in November 1892. The German original of Engels' letter has been found in the Vienna State Archive. A report on the celebrations was carried in the Arbeiter-Zeitung, No. 51, December 16, 1892.

<br>Dear Comrades,
<br>Sincere congratulations on the silver anniversary of the Association. The fight lasted long enough so that you might celebrate the happy occasion with honour.
<br>And even outside Austria, there are plenty of people who admire your stamina in these battles. Your past is a guarantee for us all in future as well.
<br>Many thanks for your kind invitation, which I am unfortunately unable to accept.
<br>Once more: long live the festival of the proletariat, long live international Social Democracy!
<br>Yours as ever,
<br><i><b>F. Engels</b></i>

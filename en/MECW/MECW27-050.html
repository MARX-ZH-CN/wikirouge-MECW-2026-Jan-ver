<blockquote>
<p>Engels wrote this message of greetings in response to the invitation to take part in the 25th anniversary celebrations of the Vienna Workers ' Educational Association (founded on December 15, 1867) sent by the Association's board in November 1892. The German original of Engels' letter has been found in the Vienna State Archive. A report on the celebrations was carried in the Arbeiter-Zeitung, No. 51, December 16, 1892.

<p>[London,] December 9, 1892</p>
<p>122, Regent's Park Road</p>
<p>Dear Comrades,</p>
<p>Sincere congratulations on the silver anniversary of the Association. The fight lasted long enough so that you might celebrate the happy occasion with honour.</p>
<p>And even outside Austria, there are plenty of people who admire your stamina in these battles. Your past is a guarantee for us all in future as well.</p>
<p>Many thanks for your kind invitation, which I am unfortunately unable to accept.</p>
<p>Once more: long live the festival of the proletariat, long live international Social Democracy!</p>
<p>Yours as ever,</p>
<p><i><b>F. Engels</b></i>

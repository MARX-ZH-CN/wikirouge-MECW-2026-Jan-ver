ENGELS TO MARX<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester,] 13 February 1865</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Your SUGGESTIONS came just in time yesterday and have both been used. How necessary the one about the demands of the louts in particular was,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> was further brought home to me by Nos. 20 and 21 of the Sow's-Dirt<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> which arrived today.</p>
<p>By the by, our attitude seems to be bearing fruit in spite of everything. There is a certain revolutionary note in No. 21 which was entirely absent before. By the by, I've written to Liebknecht that there's no point in raising a storm, they must just drop their flirting with reaction and make sure the aristocracy and reaction get their SHARE, too, but for the rest <i>abuse</i> neither them nor the bourgeoisie, which is superfluous in quiet times.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>But one can see that Izzy<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> has given the movement a Tory-Chartist character,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> which it will be difficult to get rid of and which has given rise to a tendency in Germany which was previously unheard of among the workers. This nauseating toadying to the reaction comes through everywhere. WE SHALL HAVE SOME TROUBLE WITH THAT. You wait and see, the louts will be saying, what's that Engels after, what has he been doing all the time, how can he speak in our name and tell us what to do, the fellow's up there in Manchester exploiting the workers, etc. To be sure, I don't give a damn about it now, but it's bound to come, and we shall have Baron Izzy to thank for it.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

It headed the London trade unions numbering many thousands of members and was influential amongst the British workers. In the first half of the 1860s the Council directed the British workers' campaign against intervention in the USA, in defence of Poland and Italy, and later for the legal status of the trade unions. The leaders of the following large trade unions played a big role in the Council: the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners (Robert Applegarth), the Shoemakers' Society (George Odger), the Operative Bricklayers' Society (Edwin Coulson and George Howell) and the Amalgamated Engineers (William Allan).<br>The London Trades Council's representatives took part in establishing the International Working Men's Association (the First International) and were members of its Central (General) Council. But, while maintaining contacts with the International Association and collaborating with it, the London Council, influenced by some reformist trade unionists, refused (finally in January 1867) to officially affiliate to it as an English section.<br>The<i> Trades' Unionists Manhood Suffrage and Vote by Ballot Association</i> was founded in September 1864. Odger was its President, Hartwell its Secretary, and Trimlett its Treasurer. Subsequently all of them became members of the Central (General) Council of the International Working Men's Association.</span>

Voicing the discontent of the landed aristocracy at the growing economic and political power of the bourgeoisie, the Tory philanthropists criticised the capitalist system and supported the half-hearted measures for improving the condition of the workers. However, they adopted a hostile attitude to the independent revolutionary working-class movement.</span>

ENGELS TO FILIPPO TURATI</p>
<p>IN MILAN</p>
<p>London, 7 March 1891</p>
<p>122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Very many thanks for your kind letter of 23 February,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> the 3 numbers of the <i>Critica Sociale</i> and your offer to send it to me regularly in future. As former Secretary for Italy on the General Council of the International I naturally take a great interest in the progress of the socialist movement in your country and particularly in Lombardy where, as a young man, I spent three months,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> of which I still retain happy memories.</p>
<p>I should like to thank you equally for the good wishes you were kind enough to send me on the occasion of the publication of the article by Marx<sup>a</sup> in the <i>Neue Zeit.</i> In publishing it I was merely carrying out my duty to the memory of Marx on the one hand and to the German party on the other.</p>
<p>You are quite right when you wonder whether I shall have time to contribute either to your revue or to the socialist library you are about to publish. Indeed the preparation of new editions of Marx's works and of my own pamphlets will barely leave my time to finish the manuscript of Volume III of Marx's <i>Capital.</i> Just now I <i>have four</i> pamphlets<sup>1</sup> to revise, complete and furnish with new introductions, so how can I possibly find time for any other work? Nevertheless I wish you every success and shall be interested to see a good Italian translation of our 1847 <i>Manifesto</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> and, were you to find that one or other of my articles might be of interest to the Italian public, I should be delighted to re-read my work in your <i>bella e ricchissima lingua.</i><sup>c</sup> <i>E con distinta stima La saluto,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>

ENGELS TO ANTONIO LABRIOLA</p>
<p>IN ROME</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>London, 30 March 1890. Labriola. Dear Professor,—Please accept my thanks for the pamphlets you were so very good as to send me. I read the first, <i>Del socialismo,</i> with much interest and next week, when I hope to have some leisure, shall go carefully through the second one, that on the philosophy of history.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> This is a subject in which Marx and I had long taken a special interest. A new contribution from Vico's mother country and from a scholar conversant with our German philosophers calls for my fullest attention. I should like to take the liberty of sending you in return my little piece of Feuerbach.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>I am also indebted to you for your kind endeavours on behalf of P. Martignetti, which have, I am glad to say, met with their first big success. I have been in correspondence with Mr Martignetti since 1884 and am morally convinced that he is innocent of the actions imputed to him and has fallen victim to a shabby intrigue. Perhaps, when you have occasion, you would convey to Mr Avv.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Lollini my most sincere thanks for his willing, able and successful defence of Martignetti. I trust that this magnanimous intervention on the part of you both will succeed in protecting him from undeserved vilification and ruin.</p>
<p>You must forgive me for writing to you in German. Over the last few years, however, my Italian, such as it is, has, alas, grown exceedingly rusty and I dare not mangle the Italian language in front of a master of that beautiful tongue.</p>
<p>Very respectfully yours,</p>
<p>F. E.

ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>[Manchester,] 1 May 1870
<br>Dear Moor,
<br>POOR Schapper! The toll amongst our old comrades is getting very high.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Weerth, Weydemeyer, Lupus, Schapper—but, all the same, à <i>la guerre comme à la guerre.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Couldn't you get me a photograph of him? Or, if possible, two, you know the Solingen people also want one.
<br>Thanks for the papers. Everything requested goes back tomorrow. I would have sent <i>Egalité</i> and <i>Solidarité</i> long ago, but I thought the GENERAL COUNCIL would have received <i>several</i> copies. In the Spanish things, which certainly still betray a rather Spanish standpoint, you can see how Bakunin's phraseology shines through.
<br>I saw Gumpert yesterday. When he asked after you, and I told him your liver complaints were flaring up again, he blew up without waiting for anything further: <i>Why doesn't he go to Karlsbad?</i> There you have the answer. He thinks it would be best early in the summer, or only towards autumn, since it is very full there in July-August, and horribly hot. The Crown Prince of Prussia is there at the moment, wouldn't you like to keep him company? He is an 'edicated'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> man.
<br>The resolution on <i>Bee-Hive</i> will please Sam Moore greatly; he has taken <i>Bee-Hive</i> up to now, and been very annoyed at the lousy sheet. I shall tell him he should take <i>Reynolds's,</i> or do you know something better? Does the <i>Democratic News</i> still exist?
<br>Enclosed, the latest from Wilhelm.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> He very much favours Prussia being the <i>only serious</i> opponent of the revolution in Germany, but is very much against it being a <i>serious</i> opponent.
<br><i>Pauvre hère!</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> <br>Lizzie, for whom I immediately made a quick translation of the 3 Williams, is absolutely enthusiastic about them, and thanks MR Williams warmly.
<br>Best greetings.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.
<br>For some time now your letters have been arriving in an unobjectionable condition. At least they have become more careful.
<br>Steps have presumably been taken for a decent obituary on Schapper in the press? I don't know whether Eccarius is the man to do justice to this best type of old conspirator.

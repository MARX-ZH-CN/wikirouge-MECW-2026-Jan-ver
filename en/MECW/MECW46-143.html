MARX TO JENNY LONGUET</p>
<p>IN ARGENTEUIL</p>
<p>Monte Carlo, 8 May 1882 Hôtel de Russie, Monte Carlo</p>
<p>Dear Jennychen,</p>
<p>The said <i>Monte Carlo,</i> whence I send you these lines, is one of the 3 places (adjoining one another) whose trinity constitutes the state of 'Monaco' (i.e. Monaco, Condamine and Monte Carlo). A really beautiful situation. Climate preferable to that of Nice or even Men- ton.</p>
<p>I need hardly say that with comical consistency I imported into the region <i>the first 2 rainy days</i> (since January); it would seem that they were only awaiting my arrival from Algiers for this to happen. Apart from that I struck magnificent weather.</p>
<p>As you will have learnt from my last letter,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>I am quit of my pleu- risy; the bronchial catarrh can only clear up very gradually. More- over the atmosphere will soon be warm and dry <i>everywhere</i> (which, however, raises fears of a water shortage); the intensity of the sun's ac- tion will be all the greater for its being strewn with large spots. So everywhere there will soon be the kind of weather I need.</p>
<p>As I am not sure how long I shall be staying here, I should like you to let me know at once from Paris <i>where</i> I can find you; it would be best if you <i>telegraphed</i> me here, for a telegram will give me sufficient in- formation in 3 or 4 words.</p>
<p>Lots of kisses for the children.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>OLD Moor

ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>London, 29 November 1886</p>
<p>Dear Kautsky,</p>
<p>This morning a letter from Mrs Liebknecht wherein, on her husband's advice, she informs me that she will be arriving day after tomorrow at Victoria Station via Flushing. As this question cropped up yesterday, I hasten to let you know and leave it to you to decide whether, as the only person acquainted with her, you are under any compulsion to go and meet her at the station in the middle of the night. Far be it from me to put any kind of pressure on you — I merely thought fit to acquaint you with this weighty Victorian fact.</p>
<p>We have got some more beer in, if only I were allowed to drink it! Regards to your wife.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F.E.
</p>

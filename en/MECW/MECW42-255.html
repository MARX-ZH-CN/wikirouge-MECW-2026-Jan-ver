MARX TO ENGELS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 11 September 1867</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>Regarding the 'transatlantic Ocean', it is a matter for the final corrector to put right such <i>lapsus pennae</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I see that the <i>Zukunft</i> has reprinted this splendid 'flow' along with the greater part of the preface.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The translation in <i>The Bee-Hive</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> is by Eccarius. I believe that most of the errors stem not from him, but, because of his bad hand-writing, from <i>The Bee-Hive's</i> CORRECTORS. I would naturally have preferred you to do the translation. However, as Eccarius offered his services <i>de prime abord,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> and is now on the staff of <i>The Bee-Hive,</i> that was not feasible.</p>
<p>I shall personally deliver the coup de grâce to those Proudhonist jackasses at the next congress in Brussels. I have DIPLOMATICALLY MANAGED the whole affair and did not want to COME OUT <i>personally</i> before my book appears and our Association is firmly rooted. By the by, I shall give them a caning in the OFFICIAL REPORT of the GENERAL COUNCIL (despite all their efforts, the Parisian wind-bags were unable to prevent our re-election<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> ).</p>
<p>MEANWHILE our Association has made great progress. The wretched <i>Star,</i> which wanted to ignore us entirely, announced in its leading article yesterday that we are more important than the PEACE CONGRESS.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> Schulze-Delitzsch could not prevent his ' <i>Workers<b> </b></i><b>Association</b> in Berlin from joining us.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> Those wretches from among the English TRADE UNIONISTS, who think we are too 'extreme', are coming flocking. Besides the <i>Courrier français,</i> there have been reports on our congress in Girardin's <i>Liberté, Siècle, Mode, Gazette de France,</i> etc. <i>Les choses marchent</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> And when the next revolution comes, and that will perhaps be sooner than might appear, <i>we</i> (i.e., you and I) will have this mighty ENGINE <i>at our disposal.</i> COMPARE WITH THIS THE RESULTS OF MAZZINFS, ETC, OPERATIONS SINCE 30 YEARS! And with no money to boot! And with the intrigues of the Proudhonists in Paris, Mazzini in Italy and the jealous Odger, Cremer, Potter in London, with the Schulze-Delitzsch and the Lassalleans in Germany! We can be well satisfied!</p>
<p>My children arrived back safe and in good spirits with Lafargue yesterday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> He has brought an enormous crystal goblet (holds IV2 POTS) back with him for you. He appears to be impressed with your 'transatlantic Ocean'.</p>
<p>In these days, Lafargue would like to visit you for 3 days at this time before his lectures begin again. The most awkward thing about it is that he is demanding (of course, not being IN THE SECRET OF MY MONEY-AFFAIRS) that I should accompany him, and I have not yet found a satisfactory excuse for turning down this tour, which I just cannot manage.</p>
<p>I am exceedingly vexed with Meissner. He has wasted weeks in bringing out the book. Why?</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>

In Marx's opinion, this task was to be carried out by the next Congress of the International which was to be held in Brussels in September 1868. Thanks to the energetic preparatory work that was done by Marx and his followers, die decisions of the Brussels Congress, especially the one on the collective ownership of land, paralysed to a considerable extent the influence of the Proudhonists in the International Association.</span>

<li id="cite_note-7"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-7">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The<i> League of Peace and Freedom</i>—a pacifist organisation that was set up in 1867 with the active participation of Victor Hugo, Giuseppe Garibaldi and other democrats. The League owed its origin to the anti-war sentiments of the masses. However, its leaders held pacifist positions; they failed to see the social causes of war and often confined its anti-war activity to mere declarations.<br>The League's constituent congress was originally scheduled for 5 September 1867 in Geneva. Its organising committee, which enjoyed the support of a number of radical and democratic public figures like John Stuart Mill and the Reclus brothers', also counted on the participation of the leaders of the European proletariat. Therefore the committee sent invitations to the sections of the Internationa] and its leaders, Marx included, to attend the congress. It was also decided to postpone the opening of the congress until 9 September, so that the delegates of the Lausanne Congress of the International (due on 2-8 September) could take part in it too.<br>The International's attitude towards the League of Peace and Freedom was discussed both in the General Council and in local sections. Marx's speech at the Council meeting of 13 August 1867 and the resolution adopted at his proposal (see present edition, Vol. 20, p. 204) formulated the principles of the International's tactics in such a bourgeois-democratic movement. In contrast to the unconditional support of the League, which is what the leaders of the British trade unions inclined towards, the International's tactics envisaged both the joint participation with the democrats in the struggle against the threat of war, provided the class independence of the proletarian organisation was retained, and a revolutionary proletarian approach towards the questions of war and peace in opposition to bourgeois pacifist illusions. Marx believed that the International should not take part in the League's congress on an official basis because that would mean the International's solidarity with its bourgeois programme. However, it was recommended that the International's members should attend the congress privately in order to influence its decisions in a revolutionary-democratic way.</span>

<li id="cite_note-8"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-8">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The<i> Berlin Workers' Association</i> was founded in January 1863 and was under the influence of the men of Progress (see Note 99), especially of Schulze- Delitzsch, and propagandised bourgeois co-operative societies. When the International Working Men's Association was set up, the advanced members of the Berlin Workers' Association were attracted towards it and sought to get rid of the liberals' protection. In October 1868 there was a split in the Berlin Workers' Association. Its radical members formed the Democratic Workers' Association which recognised the programme approved by the Nuremberg Congress of the Union of German Workers' Associations (headed by August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht) based on the International's principles. The Democratic Workers' Association waged a vigorous struggle against the Lassalleans. In 1869 it joined the Social-Democratic Workers' Party which came into being at the Eisenach Congress.</span>

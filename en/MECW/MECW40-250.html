MARX TO FRANZ DUNCKER</p>
<p>IN BERLIN</p>
<p>London, 21 May [1859]</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>From a communication I have received from North America<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>I see that about 100 copies of the first instalment<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>have been ordered</p>
<p><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>by party friends of mine. Whether you have already received the order, I do not know. However, I was advised at the same time that we can count on 100 more copies being ordered in the same circles as soon as the <i>price</i> is known. I would therefore request you to advise me of the latter <i>by return.</i> This does not, of course, mean that the work could not be advertised for the benefit of the general public in North America at some later date.</p>
<p>The slowness with which the matter is being handled would not appear to be in your own interest. It is certainly not in mine.</p>
<p>In the <i>list of printer's errors</i> for the sheets I have had I would request you to include the following...<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>

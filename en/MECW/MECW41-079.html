MARX TO JOHANN PHILIPP BECKER
<br>IN PARIS
<br>[London,] 23 June<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> 1860
<br>Dear Becker,
<br>Would you be so kind as to forward the enclosed letter to <i>Lommel?</i> I am sending it through you because I only have an address for Lommel in Geneva which no longer appears to be certain. At any rate, in his last few letters L. has neither mentioned the letters I sent him, nor answered my inquiry regarding the failure to arrive (should have come weeks ago) of a parcel he had advised me of.
<br>Give Schily my kindest regards. I would ask you to arrange the letter Ranickel wrote him to be sent me as soon as possible.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>It was not until a day or two ago that I became capable of work again and I am still to a certain extent convalescent.
<br>The publishers of the <i>Deutsche Zeitung,</i> which is to come out in Berlin at the beginning of July, have approached me through a third person<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> about contributions. I have not yet given them a definite answer. I am first asking for further particulars concerning the new organ's staff and politics. However, from the advertisements that have so far appeared in the papers it seems to me to be <b>pro-National Association</b><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> and, or so a friend in Berlin<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> writes, it might be feasible to exert a strong external influence on its stand. Write and let me know if you and Schily would act as joint correspondents for the paper, which evidently has <i>fonds,</i> should you get an invitation to this effect either direct from Berlin or via London! I should like to have an answer about the matter <i>by return,</i> because I would not, of course, drop any hints to this effect in Berlin unless I was certain of your accepting in Paris.
<br>One merit of About's pamphlet<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> is that the current Gotha catch-phrases are here officially adopted for Bonapartist use.
<br>I haven't seen Sasonow over here. <i>Salut.</i>
<br>Your
<br>K. M.
<br>I would ask you to send on the letter to Lommel as soon as possible.

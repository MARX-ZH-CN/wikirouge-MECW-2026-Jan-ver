ENGELS TO PYOTR LAVROV
<br>IN PARIS
<br>London, 19 January 1872 122 Regent's Park Road, N.W.
<br>My dear Friend,
<br>You will already have received the books<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> listed in the enclosed invoice for the sum of <i>£1 16s. 5d.</i> and I have debited your account accordingly.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>On the other hand I have credited you with your remittance of <i>£2 8s.,</i> which I have not yet cashed.
<br>Hodgson's work is quite unknown to me, nor have I seen it advertised anywhere. However, I shall endeavour to find out something about it.
<br>Our accounts should more or less balance now. I shall be writing to you about the <i>Gazette des Tribuneaux,</i> a journal of which I do not think we shall have any further need; the subscription expires at the end of January.
<br>You will have received <i>The Eastern Post</i> journals which I addressed to you, as also the other printed matter which I have enclosed with them from time to time.
<br>As for the International, things are going well. B.'s<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> intrigues will not amount to anything much. That man forgets that the working masses cannot be led as could a little bunch of doctrinaire sectarians. We have had, by the bye, some most valuable intelligence regarding his machinations in Russia—from the original source, at that. They are unutterably despicable.
<br>Ever your obedient servant,
<br>Yours,
<br>F. E.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">In a letter to Engels of 21 December 1871 Pyotr Lavrov asked for two works by Alexander Bain, <i>The Senses and the Intellect</i> and <i>The Emotions and the Will,</i> and for <i>The Principles of Psychology</i> by Herbert Spencer. He also requested Engels to look for Sh. H. Hodgson's <i>A New System of Philosophy</i> (the title is inaccurate; the reference is either to Hodgson's <i>Philosophy of Reflection,</i> published in 1870, or to another of his philosophical works).</span>

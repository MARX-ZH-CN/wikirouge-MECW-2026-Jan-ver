ENGELS TO MARX<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 18 March 1869</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>I am writing to Meissner about the <i>Peasant War.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Even according to <i>Social-Demokrat</i> (which I'll send you back in a couple of days), Wilhelm<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>appears to have kept ahead in Saxony.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>On the other hand, you have to grant the Lassalleans that they are developing quite a different sort of activity and know how to make ten times more out of the limited means than the People's Party does.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>Even when Schweitzer was imprisoned, the <i>Social-Demokrat</i> did not publish such idiocies as Wilhelm does.</p>
<p>I wonder what Wilhelm will say about the fact that, in Celle the <i>Hanoverian particularists,</i> defeated in the first round of polling, voted in the second round for Planck, the <i>National-Liberal</i> Bismarckian, and thus got him into the Reichstag <i>instead</i> OF Yorck, the worker. But that does not matter to Wilhelm.</p>
<p>Huxley's famous article in the <i>Fortnightly</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>in fact contains almost nothing except the joke about Comtism. The Comtists are said to be very furious about this, and intend to publish a thunderous reply, as a geological friend<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>in London writes to Moore.</p>
<p>What do you think of my suggestion about printing the articles from the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup><i>before </i>Bonaparte?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>And about the French version?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many thanks for the Castille.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup>Only yesterday was I able to start reading it. Clearly a crypto-Bonapartist factional publication. However, it is enormous progress that the June insurrection is now generally seen for what it was.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>Tony Moilin<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup>is really charming. This <i>homme de</i><sup>s</sup> 1869, who cheerfully declares that nobody should earn less than 2,400 fr.! I laughed myself half sick over this naïve doctor with extraordinary pretensions. If Lafargue were still to think anything of him, his wife would laugh at him.</p>
<p>I wanted to write to you about quite a long story, but can't recollect it at the moment. I have to go home now to hear what Gumpert has said about Lizzie, who has been in bed since Sunday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

<li id="cite_note-5"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-5">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The <i>German People's Party</i> (Deutsche Volkspartei) was set up in 1865 and encompassed the democratic elements of the petty bourgeoisie and part of the bigger bourgeoisie, chiefly from South and Central German states. As distinct from the National-Liberals, it opposed Prussia's supremacy and advocated the plan for the establishment of the so-called Great Germany incorporating both Prussia and Austria. While pursuing an anti-Prussian policy, the People's Party voiced the particularist aspirations of some German states. It was against Germany's unification as a single centralised democratic republic, advocating the idea of a federative German state.<br>In 1866, the German People's Party was joined by the Saxon People's Party, whose nucleus consisted of workers. This left wing of the German People's Party had, in effect, nothing in common with it except anti-Prussian sentiments and the wish jointly to solve the problems of national unification in a democratic way. Subsequently, it developed along socialist lines. The main section of the Party broke away from the petty-bourgeois democrats and took part in founding the Social-Democratic Workers' Party in August 1869.</span>

<li id="cite_note-6"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-6">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The events in the Charleroi coalfields occurred in the spring of 1868. In response to the mine-owners' decision to reduce production to four days a week and lower the wages by ten per cent, the workers declared a strike. On 26 March, violent clashes took place between the workers and the police. Twenty-two people were arrested and put on trial. The Belgian Section of the International launched a wide campaign to support the strikers both in Belgium and abroad. It organised protest meetings and gave wide coverage of the events in <i>La Tribune du Peuple, La Liberté</i> and other papers. On 12 April it issued a manifesto to the workers of Belgium and other countries (see <i>La Tribune du Peuple,</i> No. 4, 19 April 1868). The Section maintained regular contacts with the General Council. The Charleroi events were discussed at the Council meetings of 21 April, 12 May and 2 June 1868 (see <i>The General Council of the First International. 1866-1868. Minutes).</i> The Brussels Section set up a special committee to brief lawyers for the defence of the detainees. The lawyers managed to swing public opinion in favour of the defendants and on 15 August all of them were acquitted by the jury. This led to a rise in the membership of the International in Belgium.<br>For the <i>Geneva strike</i> of building workers see Note 16.<br>From 14 to 17 April 1868 a general strike took place in Bologna. The workers demanded that the income tax be cut down and distributed more fairly. A number of meetings and a demonstration were held. Troops were summoned to disperse the demonstration and numerous arrests were made.</span>

MARX TO EUGEN OSWALD</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>London, 4 September 1870</p>
<p><i>In great haste</i></p>
<p>Dear Oswald,</p>
<p>I only arrived back in London<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> on Saturday, and had too much BUSINESS on hand to be able to accept your kind invitation.</p>
<p>If you are doing a 4th EDITION,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> could you please put instead of <b>Association Internationale Ouvrière',<i> the </i>official<i> title current in France: </i></b><i>Association Internationale des Travailleurs'.</i> I was right about the EMPIRE ending in 'PARODY'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>K. M.

The Address was published as a leaflet on 31 July 1870; the editions that followed were signed by Marx, Engels, Liebknecht, Bebel and other members of the International. Marx and his associates agreed to sign it on conditions outlined by Marx in his letter to Oswald of 3 August 1870 (see this volume, p. 34).<br>Oswald enclosed with his letter an excerpt from Louis Blanc's letter in which he called for the Address on the Franco-Prussian War to be signed by as many people as possible.</span>

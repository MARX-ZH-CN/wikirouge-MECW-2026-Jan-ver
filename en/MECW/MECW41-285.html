MARX TO JOSEF VALENTIN WEBER</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 22 April 1863<br>9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, Haverstock Hill</p>
<p>Dear Weber,</p>
<p>Will you stand <i>surety</i> for me with a LOAN SOCIETY (for £ 1 5 to £30)?</p>
<p>I would not have troubled you with this request if</p>
<p>1. the matter were not an <i>entirely formal one, entailing no risk to yourself,</i> for I shall be getting £200 from home at the beginning of July;</p>
<p>2. Pfänder, who would otherwise have been my second surety, had not unexpectedly had to go to Manchester for several weeks.</p>
<p>In addition to other cases of illness in my family, I myself have been suffering from my periodic liver complaint for many weeks now and have thus been <i>literally incapable of writing a single line.</i> Hence the delay over the work for the Society<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> which was more disagreeable for me, of course, than for the Society itself.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i> Your</p>
<p>K. M.

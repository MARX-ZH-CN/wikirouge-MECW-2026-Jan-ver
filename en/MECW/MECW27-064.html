<p>Berlin, September 18, 1893</p>
<p>Großgörschen-Straße, 22a</p>
<p>Dear Comrades,</p>
<p>I received your letter of the 13th at the  moment of my departure from Vienna, so I could not answer it at once.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we only saw your city briefly when passing through. Hence it was impossible for us to comply with your wish and visit the editorial offices of the Sociâlny Demokrat and meet the comrades there. Both Bebel and myself sincerely regret this, but our travelling arrangements, once made, could not be changed. However, since a state of emergency had been introduced in Prague in the meantime, <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>other obstacles too would have prevented our complying with your desires.</p>
<p>With best wishes for the success of the Czech working-class movement</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>

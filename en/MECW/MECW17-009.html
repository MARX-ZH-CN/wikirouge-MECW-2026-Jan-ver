<p>For Information</p>
<p>With regard to the effusions of <i>Herr Eduard Meyen</i> in <i>Der Freischütz</i>, Nos. 17 to 21, I would say only this:</p>
<p>The libel action I am conducting against the Berlin <i>National-Zeitung</i> will achieve all that is necessary to provide a <i>legal</i> clarification of Vogt's pamphlet. His associate Eduard Meyen cannot lay claim to a like honour. The only thing I can do for Eduard Meyen is to assign to him a niche appropriate to his dimensions in the pamphlet which is due to appear after the conclusion of the court proceedings.</p>

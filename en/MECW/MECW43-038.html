<p><i>To Marx in London</i></p>
<p>[Manchester,] 2 July 1868</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Enclosed the two second halves of the two fivers, S/K 11 185 Manchester, 14 January 1867, S/K 79 542 Manchester, 12 January 1867.</p>
<p>I have written to Borkheim to get himself a new Russian book: <i>Zemlya i volya</i>, Land and Freedom, in which a German Russian, a landowner, shows that since the emancipation of the peasants the Russian peasant is being <i>ruined through communal property,</i> and ditto Russian agriculture — small and large. The book is said to contain much statistical proof. Exchange value has already penetrated too deeply into these primitive communities, so that after the abolition of serfdom the situation no longer appears to be viable.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I hope to receive good news from you again. In the meantime, best greetings for the patients, your wife and the Lafargues.</p>
<p>Your<br>F. E.

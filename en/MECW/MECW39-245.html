MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>London, 29 September 1854 28 Dean Street, Soho Dear Engels,</p>
<p>The enclosed letter from Dana will tell you about the <i>American</i> crisis AS FAR AS I AM AFFECTED BY IT. Upon my demanding that all or nothing should appear under my name, they replied by confining me solely to EDITORIAL ARTICLES at half the previous rate. For the time being I have written to Dana telling him that I have not yet reached any decision<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> but shall IN THE MEANWHILE go on <i>as</i> <i>before</i> sending 2 articles a week, because of the Sevastopol business,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> on the one hand, and of my SKETCHES of the Spanish Revolution in the nineteenth century on the other, which must be completed before the Cortes meets. In the meantime we can consider what definite answer to give the gentlemen.</p>
<p>I cannot write more than this today since I am busy just now dictating my article,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> but should have written to you at greater length had you not announced last Tuesday week that I would be getting a 'long' letter,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> which I have been waiting for in order to reply to it.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

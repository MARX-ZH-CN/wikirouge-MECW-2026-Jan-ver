ENGELS TO ADOLF HEPNER
<br>IN LEIPZIG
<br>[London,] 9 July 1872
<br>Dear Hepner,
<br>1. Proofs<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> sent off yesterday. Ditto general title. 2. A note to the above which I should very much like to see inserted since it forestalls a possible misunderstanding.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>3. Furthermore, the article on the American squabbles.<sup>b</sup>
<br>4. Sax must wait awhile.<sup>0</sup> Marx and I are leaving tomorrow to relax a little for a few days at the seaside.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> I shall be back on Tuesday the 16th of the month and shall go hard at it as soon as I have dealt with the correspondence that is certain to have piled up in my absence. Marx wanted to reply to the <i>Concordia</i> today but was unwell, and it is not clear whether he can manage it now before his return.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> He has received the <i>Volks-Zeitung.</i> Lindau will receive no article from him, you can bet on that. Marx will probably take steps himself on the matter.

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">In discussing the draft Rules drawn up by the Belgian Federal Council (see Note 524), the members of the German section of the International in Verviers voiced their firm support of the General Council. In response, as Cuno wrote to Engels on 26 July 1872, the Bakuninist majority on the Belgian Federal Council tried to blacken the character of one of the section's members and demanded that he be expelled from the International. The section in question having refused to comply, it was expelled from the Belgian Federation by the Federal Council.</span>

<li id="cite_note-4"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-4">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Responding to the slanderous article, 'Wie Karl Marx citirt', written by the German bourgeois economist Lujo Brentano and published in the <i>Concordia</i> magazine, No. 10, 7 March 1872, Marx wrote a letter to <i>Der Volksstaat</i> on 23 May, which the newspaper carried on 1 June 1872 (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 164-67). Following the publication of Marx's reply in <i>Der Volksstaat, Concordia,</i> No. 27, 4 July 1872, featured another anonymous article (also written by Brentano), 'Wie Karl Marx sich vertheidigt'. Marx's reply to the second article was published in <i>Der Volksstaat,</i> No. 63, 7 August 1872 (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 190-97).</span>

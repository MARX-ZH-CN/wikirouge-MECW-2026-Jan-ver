ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester,] 4 March 1859</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Little Jew Braun<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>has managed things well; I agree to half the net profits. The work is going ahead fairly quickly,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>9 long double pages of the kind I send you for the <i>Tribune</i> are ready, 2 or 3 more will see the finish of the Po and then comes the Rhine, which won't be as long—barely 3 sheets in all. This evening, Saturday and Sunday will certainly dispose of the better part of the thing, and I shall let you have it by Wednesday, provided all goes smoothly. However I must be on my guard since I'll have all the official military writers against me, and if they can pick any holes in the thing they'll certainly do so. So better too short than too long, and the historical examples can be done quite briefly. Besides, if the manuscript arrives in Berlin at the end of next week, it will be soon enough; after all, there's going to be war.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>So there's no need to worry about time. It's <i>impossible</i> just now to absent myself from the WAREHOUSE for several days. There's no real need and it wouldn't be much help. What holds one up is poring</p>
<p>over the map, which <i>must</i> be done <i>staccato</i> otherwise one gets bemused.</p>
<p>I'm not doing a foreword. That would be asking for too much.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

The war (29 April to 8 July 1859) was launched by Napoleon III, who under the banner of the 'liberation of Italy' strove for aggrandizement and needed a successful military campaign to shore up the Bonapartist regime in France. Piedmont ruling circles hoped that French support would enable them to unite Italy under the aegis of the Savoy dynasty. The war caused an upsurge of the national liberation movement in Italy. The Austrian army suffered a series of defeats. However Napoleon III, frightened by the scale of the liberation movement in Italy, abruptly ceased hostilities. On 11 July, the French and Austrian emperors concluded a separate preliminary peace in Villafranca. France received Savoy and Nice; Lombardy was annexed to Sardinia; the Venetian Region remained under the Austrians.—380, 399, 401, 405, 462, 537</span>

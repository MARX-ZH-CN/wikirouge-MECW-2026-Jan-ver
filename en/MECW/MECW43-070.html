ENGELS TO MARX<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 16 September 1868</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>I can only write briefly and badly, I have rheumatism in my right hand and have been writing all the afternoon.</p>
<p>Enclosed a ten-pound note. When Borkheim returns, you absolutely must force him to undertake some sort of coup, if nothing else can be done. You will understand that I myself find things rather tight at the moment. Did you ever write to <i>Meissner</i> asking for a settling of accounts? With the workers bombarding from all sides now, the burking will soon come to an end, and the second edition<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>will not have to be awaited for long. <i>Now is the time</i> to insert a new advertisement for the book. Think one out, I shall send it to Meissner, whom I owe an answer anyway. But don't put it off. Furthermore, Meissner should be sent <i>The Times</i> with the resolution of the Germans in Brussels, the <i>Demokratisches Wochenblatt</i> of yesterday,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>etc., the man must be kept happy. If you have not done it, do it (I can no longer get that No. of <i>The Times</i> here). And then the exchange value, too, will gradually come into effect for you.</p>
<p>The things in <i>The Times</i> in Eccarius' report<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>will be a big help to you here, and MR Morley will be amazed.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>The papers here also carry fairly full extracts from the report (but most in <i>The Daily News).</i></p>
<p>The congress went well after all. The method of conducting the babble in public and the BUSINESS on the quiet has worked splendidly. So, the COUNCIL will remain in London, and once again the Proudhonists have only the satisfaction of having resolved that <i>they</i> are Proudhonists, and nobody else is.</p>
<p>One might also send Meissner the No. of the <i>Zukunft</i> about Lloyd, etc., in which you are mentioned twice. I can do all this, if you want.</p>
<p>Moses Hess amused me greatly.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>But the question now arises: Has not a popular short presentation of the content of your book <i>for workers</i> become an urgent necessity? If it is not written, some Moses or other will come along and do it and botch it up. What do you think of it?</p>
<p>Enclosed also Eichhoff back.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>It is impossible to leave without stupidities being committed. While I was away,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>the fellows on the <i>comité</i> of the Schiller Institute,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>acting on the suggestion of the Bradfordians, invited that swine Vogt to give a lecture here. I naturally announced my resignation at once, 'in order not to give an indirect vote of confidence to a man who, I considered it proved, was a paid Bonapartist agent in 1859'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>The swine is coming tomorrow.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

The resolution was unanimously approved by the Congress and published in<i> The Times</i> on 15 September 1868 as part of Eccarius's report. See also Note 136.<br>The article 'Der fünfte Vereinstag deutscher Arbeitervereine zu Nürnberg (5-7.

<li id="cite_note-9"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-9">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The<i> Schiller Institute,</i> founded in Manchester in November 1859 in connection with the centenary of Friedrich Schiller's birth, was conceived as a cultural and social centre of the city's German colony. At first Engels was critical of a society notorious for its tendency towards formalism and pedantry, and he kept aloof from it. But after certain amendments had been made to its Rules, he became a member of its Directorate in 1864, and later its President, devoting much time to it and exercising a considerable influence on its activities. In 1867-68, Engels was particularly occupied with its affairs since a new building was under construction. While Engels was away from Manchester in 1868, the Directorate invited Karl Vogt, who was connected with Bonapartist circles and had been casting aspersions on the proletarian revolutionaries, to give a lecture at the society. In view of this Engels decided that his political reputation would be compromised if he remained President (see this volume, p. 100 and present edition, Vol. 21, p. 18). On 2 October the secretary Davisson approached Engels on behalf of the Directorate asking him to reconsider his decision, but Engels refused. In April 1870 he was again elected member of the Directorate, but did not take an active part in its work.</span>

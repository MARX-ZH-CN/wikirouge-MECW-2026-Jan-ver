<p>TO JULIUS SCHUBERTH IN HAMBURG</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London, about 11 April 1850]</p>
<p>Attention <i>Schuberth</i>
</p>
<ol><li>Following dispatch of the 3rd issue,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> we now await <i>at the earliest possible date</i> the statement concerning the sales of the 3 issues and <i>an adjustment of the balance</i>, and if this cannot be done before 15 April, he is to write and tell us. But at all events, to advise by return how many copies of the 3rd issue have been run off and what proportion of these are against firm orders. Only a few hundred in excess of firm orders are to be run off.</li>
<li>Since Schuberth does not consider it necessary for Mr Hagen to act as responsible editor, he is <i>in no circumstances to alter a single word of the manuscript</i>. We hereby inform him that, should this none the less occur, we must forthwith sever our connection with him. Hagen is instructed to ensure that nothing is altered.</li>
<li>Since, <i>contrary</i> to our instructions, Schuberth sent Naut 300 copies instead of 450, Naut is to take such copies as he needs from the 150 which Schuberth sent to Eisen. We further expect that the dispatch of copies to Naut will, in future, always be made <i>at the same time</i> as those to Eisen. Should we receive further complaints, we shall have to take other measures. Similarly we expect that in future the 50 copies for London will be dispatched by the first steamer after the issue is ready.</li></ol>
<p><i>(A letter to be written to Hagen and enclosed with Schuberth's.)</i>

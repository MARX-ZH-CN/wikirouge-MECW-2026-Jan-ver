ENGELS TO HERMANN SCHLÜTER</p>
<p>IN HOTTINGEN-ZURICH</p>
<p>Eastbourne, 20 August 1886<br>4 Cavendish Place</p>
<p>Dear Mr Schlüter,</p>
<p>Now it's your turn at last. I had to give up writing letters until the English ms.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> had been finished.</p>
<p>Firstly, therefore, your letter of 10 March.</p>
<p>1) Funds received at last. Receipt made out in duplicate.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>2) Have read Lexis.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> The man is far from stupid, but he's an out- and-out rascal and knows it.</p>
<p>3) <i>The Origin</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> —Dietz's way of going about things gave me fresh proof of how arbitrarily he behaves in business matters and I shall be guided by this in future dealings with him. Apart from that, the outcome has been satisfactory and has enabled the thing to reappear in the bookshops.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>4) General Council's Addresses. Whether I have them all I shall only know when my friends give me sufficient time to put Marx's letters, etc., in order. So until then I shan't be able to help you.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>5) Chartist ms.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> will be finished as soon as I get back to London <i>after the 28th.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> I shall probably have a chance to consult our old friend Harney about doubtful points; he is sure to be in London now. The article in the <i>Rheinische Jahrbücher</i> is by Weerth and you may name him.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Postcard of 8/6.— You might send me the letters from the late Heß' papers when convenient, though they're unlikely to amount to more than tittle-tattle. After 1848 the good Moses ceased to be connected with any real movement and merely did a bit of Lassalling for a time under Schweitzer.</p>
<p>Letter 16/8.— I shall be glad to look over <i>The Housing Question;</i> the thing can be reprinted pretty well as it stands (so far as I am able to judge from memory). A word or two will be necessary by way of introduction.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>A re-issue of the <i>Mordspatrioten</i> would certainly be a very good idea. The thing is by Borkheim and I would write a short biographical note<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> to go with it. But as I have only one copy, likewise of <i>The Housing Question,</i> and as both of them will probably call for notes, I should be grateful if you would send me one copy of each (to London).</p>
<p>Would you kindly give the enclosed line to Ede.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F. Engels

Nieuwenhuis also informed Engels that he planned to translate his work <i>Socialism: Utopian and Scientific</i> into Dutch, which he actually did in 1886. Nieuwenhuis further enquired about Engels' plan with regard to Volume II of Marx's <i>Capital,</i> further study of the English labour movement after 1845 and the reissue of Engels' <i>The Condition of the Working-Class in England.</i></span>

Schlüter asked Engels to look through the introduction he had written for this publication. He later changed his plans and published the manuscript anonymously after Engels had looked through it under the title <i>Die Chartistenbewegung in England,</i> Hottingen-Zürich, 1887 (see also Note 453).</span>

<br><i>To Marx in London</i>
<br><b>Manchester, 24 June 1868</b>
<br>Dear Moor,
<br>Enclosed S/K 60 115 and 60 116 — two fivers. Yesterday I had such a fuss because of the building work in the Schiller Institute that I left the <b>warehouse</b> without sending them to you and had not a moment until it was too late. Today again all sorts of things are preventing me from writing to you more fully, if I am not to sacrifice the time which should be devoted to the article this evening; in any case yesterday nothing was done on it.
<br>Regarding the sore throats, be careful. Of course, they are now epidemic and mostly innocent, but since the time when diphtheria became epidemic here it has always been better to consult a doctor quickly so that you know where you are.
<br>Your<br>F. E.

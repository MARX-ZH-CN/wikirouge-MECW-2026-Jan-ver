ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>[Manchester,] 1 February 1860
<br>Dear Moor,
<br>This time, then, the business is growing more serious every day. Mr Altenhöfer and the devious Hafner in Paris have each published personal, if somewhat vague, statements in the Augsburg <i>Allgemeine Zeitung.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Now we get Lassalle's sagacious letter.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> The chap is himself already almost a Bonapartist, at a time when coquetting with Bonapartism seems to be the order of the day in Berlin, so Mr Vogt will undoubtedly find the ground favourable <i>there.</i> A fine notion of Lassalle's, that one shouldn't use one's connection with the Augsburg <i>A. Z.</i> against Vogt and Bonaparte, yet Vogt can use Bonapartist money for Bonapartist ends and keep his hands perfectly clean! In the eyes of these folk, it is actually meritorious of Bonap. to have beaten the Austrians; the specific Prussian spirit and Berlin punditry are again in the ascendant and things in that city must look almost as they did after the peace of Basle.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> There's no reasoning with such people. Lassalle seems to excrete this paltry, niggling pap as naturally as his turds, and maybe a good deal more easily—what answer can one give to such inanities and facile wisdom! Extraordinary advice, the chap doles out!
<br>Let's wait until we've got the pamphlet,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> and in the meantime cast round for somewhere to print and someone to publish our riposte. If possible, Germany and the opposing party's headquarters, Berlin. The business of the 3,000 copies is plainly a lie of Vogt's.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> However, there's scandal enough and to spare. I shall go and see Lupus today and tell him to rack his brains for all the material he can lay hands on concerning Vogt. In the meantime, I shall sort through the papers dealing with 1850/52 and you must look out our old manuscript about the émigrés.<sup>b</sup> So far, I have no idea of what the fellow actually says.
<br>Regards to the FAMILY.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

The peace with Prussia initiated the collapse of the coalition; Spain concluded a separate peace treaty with France in Basle on 22 July 1795.</span>

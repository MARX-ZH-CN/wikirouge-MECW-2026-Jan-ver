ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>Bridlington Quay, 13 September 1880<br>7 Burlington Place
<br>Dear Moor,
<br>Have received the enclosed from Liebknecht. I am writing to tell him that, provided he hears nothing to the contrary within the next few days, we shall be back in London again from next Sunday, 19 September, and shall be expecting them (him and Bebel). So if you should be prevented in any way, kindly let me know.
<br>I haven't had an answer to a postcard sent from here to your address in Ramsgate on 29 August; no doubt it didn't arrive. Yesterday I heard from Lafargue, who said you would be returning to London today.
<br>We shall be returning at the end of this week; wet weather since the day before yesterday, before which the weather was splendid.
<br>I hope your wife is better. Warmest regards to all, likewise from Moore and Beust.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.
<br>If you can postpone the Grant business until my arrival, it might be possible to obtain more information.
<br>Best wishes to Laura from us all.
<br>Yours ever,
<br>F.E.
<br>I shall bring the articles of association with me unless you need them at once.

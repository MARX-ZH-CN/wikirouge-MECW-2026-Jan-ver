MARX TO KARL EDUARD VEHSE</p>
<p>IN DRESDEN</p>
<p>[Rough copy]</p>
<p>[London, end of November 1852] Sir,</p>
<p>No doubt you thought it unusual that I, a stranger, should have written to you like an old friend.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>For this you must ascribe the blame to Weerth and Reinhardt. However, I realise that I was thoroughly mistaken. As an acquaintance of Campe's, that old usurer, perjurer and maid-wife-widower, you must have been aware that this individual is one of my mortal enemies, and hence you had no right to offer him my pamphlet,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>thereby affording him the opportunity he desired of conveying his impertinences to me indirectly and at no risk to himself. I am not personally acquainted with the individual, although possessed of some specific information about him. The fact that I am engaged in a fight <i>à mort</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>with the SHAM LIBERALS is enough to expose me to his intrigues which, <i>il en peut être sûr</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>I shall answer when the time is ripe.</p>
<p>In the second place you had no right whatever, upon receiving an inquiry from me, to write to Mr Bangya. So far as I am aware, it was I who introduced you to Mr Bangya, but in no sense did I present him as my confident in private matters. And it is strange to have Campe's insolence conveyed to me through a 3rd party whom Mr Campe—I have this on the authority of Weerth here and shall inform Bangya accordingly—declares to be a <i>spy</i>.</p>
<p>Should this letter cause you offence, you need only come to London; you know where I live and may be assured that you will always find me prepared to give you the satisfaction customary in such cases.</p>
<p>Dr K. Marx

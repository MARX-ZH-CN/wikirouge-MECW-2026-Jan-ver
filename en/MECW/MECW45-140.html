MARX TO WILHELM BRACKE</p>
<p>IN BRUNSWICK</p>
<p>[London,] 14 February 1877<br>41 Maitland Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Bracke,</p>
<p>Lissagaray, who is otherwise completely in agreement with your draft contract, is firmly of the opinion that in every case the price (per copy) should be kept to the <i>minimum</i> quoted by you.<sup>1</sup> 4</p>
<p>So far as the free copies for himself are concerned, a dozen would amply suffice.</p>
<p>Apropos! Miss Isolde Kurz has written to me, partly to say that she will be sending you the manuscript direct, while<br>
the proof-sheets would come to me from you (I have no objection), partly to ask for a further consignment of sheets from the original; the latter have now been sent her by Lissagaray. <i>But notabene, Lissagaray</i> has also made all manner of alterations to the <i>introduction, additions</i> (very important ones) to the French original, etc., so that <i>nothing should be printed in Brunswick before Isolde has made corresponding modifications to the initial sheets she has already translated.</i> Thus, should Isolde's manuscript be already in Bruns- wick by the time my letter arrives, it should not be printed but returned to her for alteration.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the German edition will acquire extra value as a result of these alterations and additions made by the author himself.</p>
<p>With kindest regards,</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>K. Marx

<p>Cologne, May 29. Today the police court passed sentence in a case which has been pending since September of last year concerning a charge of libelling deputies of the Frankfurt National Assembly.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Summoned before the court were: K. Marx, E. Dronke, G. Weerth, H. Becker, H. Korff, and the printers Dietz and Bechtold. The first three did not attend. With the exception of Korff, all were acquitted. Korff (as former responsible manager of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung) was sentenced to one month's imprisonment and payment of one-seventh of the costs, on the charge of insulting the "comical Stedtmann". The court very incisively rejected the accusation against Weerth in regard to Schnapphahnski-Lichnowski.

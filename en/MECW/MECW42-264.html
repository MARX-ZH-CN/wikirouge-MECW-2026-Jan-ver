MARX TO ENGELS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 9 October 1867</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>Borkheim is expecting a letter from you first that you are willing to be co-guarantor.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Poor</i> Lafargue is in the final throes today, putting Borkheim's <i>preface</i> into decent French (insofar as that is possible!). The latter has baptised his opus: '<b>Ma perle<i> devant le Congrès de Genève</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></b></p>
<p>Curious how the itch for literary fame can make a FOOL of an otherwise quite intelligent <i>garçon</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>!</p>
<p>So, yesterday, Fox was to decapitate Eccarius.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>The former took more than 1 hour to speak his indictment. He had most maliciously assembled the worst passages and displayed all the arts of an Old Bailey<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>barrister, also continually attacking me. In my riposte I dealt him such telling blows that in his final REPLY he quite lost his composure and self-control. Everyone joined in the discussion. The outcome: my MOTION (or amendment RATHER) 'to proceed to the order of the day' was accepted by an enormous majority. Nevertheless, Eccarius got a regular dressing down in the course of the debate.</p>
<p>You must read the piece 'Le troisième larron' I have marked in the <i>Courrier</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>that you will get at the same time (splendid that the French are already <i>sans gêne</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>calling <i>their</i> Bonaparte one of the <i>larrons</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>As soon as I have the numbers back from Lormier, I shall send the interesting COMMUNICATIONS about the MEXICAN affair.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Salut</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>Apropos. Strohn spent the day here yesterday. He fancies you meant to slight him on his last visit to Manchester, with your remark, 'Yes, in Bradford the <i>commis voyageur</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup>still counts for something.' I tried to drive this nonsense out of his mind.— He says Dronke had procured the British <i>associé</i> for the copper company himself. He had probably demanded to be indemnified for it, and no doubt he had based himself on spurious but legally defensible claims when appropriating or laying his hands on a portion of the copper passing through his hands. He did not believe that Dronke had unwarrantedly <i>frisé</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup>the <i>code pénal</i> directly. <i>Tant mieux</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup></p>

The invaders also intended to use Mexican territory as a spring-board for intervening in the US Civil War on the side of the slaveholding Southern States. In the summer of 1863 the French occupied the city of Mexico (Britain and Spain recalled their troops in April 1862 because of contradictions with France) and declared Mexico an empire with Napoleon Ill's henchman, the Archduke of Austria Maximilian, at its head. However, the Mexican people put up a stubborn resistance to the French colonialists and inflicted a heavy defeat on them. In March 1867 they were compelled to withdraw.</span>

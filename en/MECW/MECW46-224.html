ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN
<br>IN ZURICH
<br>London, 16 December 1882
<br>Dear Mr Bernstein,
<br>Schorlemmer complains that he has not received the <i>Sozialdemo- krat</i> for some little while; his subscription expired and he sent me the encl. CHEQUE (which I forgot about) no less than a month ago with the request that his <i>annual</i> subscription be renewed and 'the balance be used for party purposes'.
<br>The ms. of the Mark has had to be completely rewritten 3 times; on top ofthat I again had to go through about 5 or 6 of Maurer's 10 fat volumes,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> besides which there were other sources to compare. I have now sent it to Marx who has slogged away at the subject much more thoroughly and for much longer than I have 4 7 5; I expect it back on Monday.
<br>Malon <i>se moque de</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Vollmar. Otherwise he would certainly have corrected the latter's howler to the effect that the 'Alliancists' at- tacked by the <i>Egalité</i> were understood in the sense of the Bakuninist Alliance.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Far from it. The Possibilists were thus described because they are now wholly indistinguishable from the people in the Alliance socialiste 4 7 6 which was founded some 4 years ago by Jourde, the ex- Communard for finance, with the help of past and present Proudhon- ists (e.g. Longuet) and which constitutes <i>La Justice's</i> socialist re- serve. You must certainly have seen this Alliance mentioned in con- nection with elections; it put up candidates for the recent general election to the Chamber and obtained nearly as many votes — in some <i>arrondissements</i> at any rate — as the Parti ouvrier.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> If Vollmar knew nothing of this, despite his year and a half in Paris, it was because Malon deliberately kept it from him like much else. That's what happens when you give a gang your uncritical sup- port.
<br>I have to chuckle when Vollmar praises Malon as the party disci- plinarian and accuses the others of a breach of discipline.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> <br>Who, I ask, is guilty of indiscipline — he who carries the old flag high or he who recruits people with the express aim of deserting the colours and exchanging the old flag for a new one? Where, I ask, would Malon have got his majority at St-Etienne from<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> if he hadn't first recruited people whose intention from the start, and this was precisely why they had been recruited, was to subvert the old programme?
<br>That was a choice row between Malon and his Clovis Hugues over Louis Blanc. And they call themselves a party!
<br>You will have seen that the Fédération du Nord 4 5 4 has declared outright for Roanne.
<br>Some of Lafargue's articles in the more recent issues of the <i>Egalité</i> have been truly delightful, e.g. on Bontoux's candidature.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> <br>Witticisms are better suited to them than doctrinaire pontifica- tions.
<br>Would you please be good enough to see that the issues are sent on to Schorlemmer.
<br>Yours very sincerely,
<br>F. E.

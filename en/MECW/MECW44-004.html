MARX TO EUGEN OSWALD</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 26 JULY 1870<br>
1 Maitland Park Road,<br>
Haverstock Hill, N.W.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I must first of all ask your forgiveness for my delay in replying to you. Your letter arrived on Thursday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> at 6 p.m.; I had just left London for a TRIP IN the COUNTRY.</p>
<p>However, I would not have been able to join in a public Address because the General Council of the International Working Men's Association, of which I am a member, had already charged me with the task of composing a similar Address.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> The piece had been written already, submitted for discussion and was approved unanimously last Tuesday. It was to have appeared in <i>The Times</i> today, but was suppressed, probably because it contained a hit at <i>Russia.</i> However, there is some prospect of its appearing in the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Paris is now in a state of siege. We have organs at our disposal in all other West European countries and in the United States.</p>
<p>Should the Address be published here you will discover that its <i>political</i> viewpoint (and it is this we are concerned with in the first instance) coincides with your own, however widely our social views may diverge. AT ALL EVENTS, I am convinced that a genuine power of resistance to the return of national antagonisms and the entire system of present-day diplomacy can <i>only</i> be found in the <i>working class.</i></p>
<p>However that may be, I am quite prepared to have further discussions on this important subject. Please let me know whether and when you might honour me with a visit, or when I can find you at home.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

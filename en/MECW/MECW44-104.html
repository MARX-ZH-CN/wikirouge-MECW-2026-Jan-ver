<p><i>To Nikolai Danielson in St Petersburg</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 22 July [1871]</b>
Dear Friend,</p>
<p>Excuse me for answering with such a delay. I have been so much <i>overworked</i> during this latter time that I got hardly to bed.</p>
<p>Hence I could not think of doing anything concerning <i>The Capital</i>. Next week, however, I shall commence and make the whole thing ready for you.</p>
<p><i>I had a packet ready for Berlin</i>, but, unfortunately, it has, by some mistake, not been sent off. It is still here. So please send me a new address for Berlin, and I shall dispatch the packet at once.</p>
<p>As to our mutual friend [Hermann Lopatin] the most alarming news has arrived here, but, I hope, it is false, or at all events exaggerated.</p>
<p>If you were able to find me a <i>correspondent in Berlin</i> who might serve as an intermediary for some of the commercial business I have to transact with Petersburg, it would be a useful thing, and for <i>some articles</i> that circuitous way might prove shorter than the direct way. The straight line is not in all cases, as the mathematicians fancy, the shortest one.</p>
<p>Yours most faithfully,<br>A. Williams

ENGELS TO MARIA MENDELSON</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Eastbourne, 15 March 1893</p>
<p>28 Marine Parade</p>
<p>My dear Mme Mendelson,</p>
<p>I could not describe the joy with which Mme Kautsky and I received this morning the news that St.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> is once more out of danger—we talked of him yesterday evening with some anxiety. All's well that ends well, and I cannot wait to see him again on Saturday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> evening—in any case, we hope to have the pleasure of seeing both of you on Sunday at our place.</p>
<p>We have been here for a fortnight, and we are returning to London the day after tomorrow. The weather is wonderful, and the sea breezes have done us a great deal of good.</p>
<p><i>Au revoir. Very</i> best wishes from Mme Kautsky.</p>
<p>Your devoted friend,</p>
<p>F. Engels</p>
<p>We are expecting Bebel on Monday or Tuesday, and M. and Mme Lafargue a few days later.

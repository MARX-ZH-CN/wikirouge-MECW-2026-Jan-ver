MARX TO THOMAS ALLSOP</p>
<p>IN LIMINGTON</p>
<p>[London,] 16 October 1876<br>41 Maitland Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>My dear and honoured Friend,</p>
<p>A few days since Mr Leblanc informed us of the decease of your wife, but I find it even now almost impossible to address you a few lines. Those who had the privilege of knowing and admiring your noble companion for life, dare not intrude with empty words of consolations. It was in fact but her love for you, her fear to leave you alone that enabled her to resist so bravely to increasing ailings and to struggle so hard with nature for her own existence. Your love of mankind, your passionate interest in its general life, will, I hope, enable you to bear even with this irreparable loss.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Your most devoted friend</p>
<p>Karl Marx

How deep, how bitter must be your sorrow, your solitude and loneliness!..."</span>

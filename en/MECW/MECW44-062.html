MARX TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>London, 21 January 1871<br>1 Maitland Park Road, Haverstock Hill, N.W.</p>
<p>Dear Mr Sorge,</p>
<p>All reports from the German sections in America are to be sent to me. Eccarius is only the correspondent for the Yankees. <i>As</i> Secretary TO THE GENERAL COUNCIL he has nothing to do with FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE.</p>
<p>I had completely forgotten the business about the 'contribution' of the German section.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>On receiving your letter, therefore, I wrote to Eccarius<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>whose reply, which I enclose, can also serve as a receipt.</p>
<p>I have already written about the FORMATION of the CENTRAL COUNCIL (we would have preferred the term Central Committee to avoid confusion).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>I have not received Kellogg.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>It was presumably sent in a yellow envelope that I received from the POST OFFICE here. It was torn open and had been stamped 'NO CONTENTS'. I expect that the envelope was not strong enough.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I sent to your address a <i>large parcel</i> of publications of the GENERAL COUNCIL of different dates but up to now have had no notice of receipt. They belonged to me personally and I sent them because the supplies of the GENERAL COUNCIL are quite exhausted (for the majority of its publications).</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>K. Marx

ELEANOR MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[Ramsgate,] 12 August 1870<br>36 Hardres Street</p>
<p>My dear Engels,</p>
<p>You will see from the address that we are once more at Ramsgate.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I suppose you know that last Tuesday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Mohr and Jenny went to look for houses.—Mama and I left London yesterday, and after a very pleasant journey arrived here safe and sound. I say a <i>pleasant</i> journey, though I dont think Mama thought so. The sea was very rough, the waves washing over the ship and wetting everybody.—All the passengers with the exception of one lady, myself, and several gentlemen, were sea-sick. This lady and I climbed up just by the side of the Captain's deck, and there we sat down. It was great fun. This morning I turned out before six o'clock in the morning and walked about till nine. I intend to go to the sands now and take a good bath.—Yesterday Papa had a letter from Kugelmann.—He writes about that book to which Rossa's likeness is to be prefixed.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> He thanks very much for what you wrote,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> but says he has not got the likeness.— Now Jane sent it shortly after your preface was sent—so I suppose they didn't get it. Would you mind sending them your copy—you know that one that was given with <i>The Irishman.</i>—We shall be much obliged to you if you will.—Now I must finish, for I'm in a hurry to go out again, so with best love to all</p>
<p>Believe me to be</p>
<p>Your affectionate</p>
<p>Tussy

At the request of Marx's eldest daughter Jenny, Engels wrote short notes for the Preface (see present edition, Vol. 21, p. 140). However, neither Rossa's portrait nor Engels' notes appeared in the collection, which was published in Hanover in 1870.</span>

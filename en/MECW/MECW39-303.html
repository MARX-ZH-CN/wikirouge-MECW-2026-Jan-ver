ADOLF CLUSS TO JOSEPH WEYDEMEYER</p>
<p>IN NEW YORK</p>
<p>Washington, May 15th 1853</p>
<p>... Marx has written me a very jolly letter in which he says that everyone was greatly amused by my description of the doings of Willich, that 'brother of the guild of misery'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> He says that, amid peals of Homeric laughter, they resolved <i>en grand comité</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> to wish his 'life' as unhampered a course as possible. He remarks: 'If the lunacy of this <i>drôle</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> were not intermixed and interlarded with cunning calculations as to how best to fill his belly without doing any work, he would long since have found his way to the lunatic asylum.' In return for my report, Marx is going to send me in his next a copy of the passage relating to Willich in <i>The Great Men of the Exile</i>.</p>
<p><i>Revolution and Counter-Revolution</i>. Marx says he has no time for translation; if you or I or someone else will undertake to translate it, and if we let him know where he left off, he will take upon himself to write the whole of the conclusion.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> Marx is of the opinion that as a pamphlet, the thing will <i>not</i> sell, and certainly not pay for itself; he would be perfectly satisfied with a feuilleton. (So whatever remains to be done would be left to us.)</p>
<p>Raveaux's former followers—philistines—long in need of another saint, have put red Becker.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> in Raveaux's place. <i>A tout seigneur tout honneur</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> </p>

ENGELS TO LOUISE KAUTSKY</p>
<p>IN VIENNA</p>
<p>[London, 9 November 1890]</p>
<p>...What I have been through these many days, how terribly bleak and desolate life has seemed and still seems to me, I need not tell you. And then came the question — what now? Whereupon, my dear Louise, an image, alive and comforting, appeared before my eyes, to remain there night and day, and that image was you. Then, like Nimmy, I said: 'Oh, if only I could have Louise here!' But I didn't dare to think that it might come true....No matter what happens, I should not have had a moment's peace had I not put this question to you first of all and straight away... Whoever keeps house for me will have to conform to local customs whereby a lady may not under- take any MANUAL SERVICES. This might even be forced upon me, and I should most certainly be compelled to have recourse to someone who was not a member of our party... So all you would have to do is supervise things, and the rest of the time you'd be free to do anything you liked...</p>
<p>In that case we could talk over the whole matter here and either re- main together as good friends or part company as good friends. Well, it's for you to decide. Think the matter over, discuss it with Adler.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> If, as I fear, this day-dream of mine cannot be realised, or if you should think that the drawbacks and vexations would, so far as you are con- cerned, outweigh the advantages and pleasures, then let me know without beating about the bush. I am far too fond of you to want you to make sacrifices for my sake... And for that very reason I would beg you not to make any such sacrifice and would request Adler through you to advise you against so doing. You are young and have a splen- did future in store. In three weeks' time I shall be seventy and have only a short while left to live. A young and hopeful existence ought not to be sacrificed to those few remaining years. For after all, I am still strong enough to make shift for myself...</p>
<p>With undying love

<p>TO MARX IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester,] 25 November 1850</p>
<p>Dear Marx,</p>
<p>I am writing today just to tell you that I am unfortunately still not in a position to send you the £2 I promised you for today in my last letter.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Ermen<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> has gone away for a few days and, since no proxy has been authorised with the bank, we are unable to make any remittances and have to content ourselves with the few small payments that happen to come in. The total amount in the cash box is only about £4 and you will therefore realise that I must wait a while. As soon as Ermen returns I shall at once send you the money. I trust the first remittance arrived safely.</p>
<p>Schramm's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> behaviour is really despicable.</p>
<p>The Harney business is indeed extremely ominous. If they are actually determined to arrest him, changing the paper's name won't help.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> Nor can he give it up altogether, and if this paper falls into the category liable to stamp duty, I can't see any possibility at all of bringing out an unstamped political weekly. In any case, he'd do better to omit his 'LABOUR RECORD' from page 8, this being NEWS and unquestionably subject to stamp duty. But from what you write it would seem that, in Jones' opinion, the content of his analytical articles is equally liable to be stamped. And that would be the limit.</p>
<p>So the outraged Schramm, to judge by Mr Seiler's begging letter, would seem to be again on the best of terms with his brother<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> and even showing him some <i>égards</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> !</p>
<p>I hope your wife is feeling better. Warm regards to her and the rest of your family from your</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p><br>
In the course of this week I shall send your wife a parcel of COTTON THREAD which I hope she will find to her liking.</p>
<p><br>

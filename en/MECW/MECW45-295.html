ELEANOR MARX TO CARL HIRSCH</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p><i>London,</i> 25 October 1875<br>
41 Maitland Park Road</p>
<p>Dear Mr Hirsch,</p>
<p>I enclose herewith a short appreciation, written by my mother, of an English actor Mr Irving. Mama would be pleased if you could arrange for its insertion in the <i>Frankfurter Zeitung.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>If he had enough time, Papa would himself have written an appreciation of Mr Irving in whom we are greatly interested (although we do not know him personally). First, because he is a man of exceptional talent and, secondly, because the entire English press, in consequence of the most wretched intrigues, has set about him, and engineered what can only be described as a plot against him. By getting the <i>Frankfurter</i> to print Mama's appreciation, you would be doing us a great service.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>I should also like to ask you on behalf of a friend, a Russian lady, if you think it might be possible to have an appreciation of Mr Irving published in the <i>Journal des Débats,</i> or else in the <i>Temps</i> or <i>Le Siècle.</i></p>
<p>I very much hope you will forgive me for bothering you like this, but you have so many contacts with the French and German press, and your influence is so great that you are the only person to whom we could turn. I hope that you will excuse me, and not hold it too much against me.</p>
<p>Papa asks me to say how grateful he is to you for the newspapers you were good enough to send him. He also sends his warm regards, as do we all, to our friend Kaub. Mama thanks you in advance and, as for myself, I remain</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>Eleanor Marx</p>
<p>Mama asks me to say that she does not wish her name <i>to appear</i> in the <i>Frankfurter,</i> but that if you want to say who wrote the appreciation, you may do so 'as between friends'.

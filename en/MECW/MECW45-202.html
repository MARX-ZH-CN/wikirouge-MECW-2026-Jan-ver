MARX TO SIGMUND SCHOTT</p>
<p>IN FRANKFURT AM MAIN</p>
<p>London, 3 November 1877<br>41 Maitland Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>My best thanks for the packages. Your offer to arrange for other material to be sent to me from France, Italy, Switzerland, etc. is exceedingly welcome, although I feel reluctant to make undue claims on you. I don't at all mind waiting, by the by, nor will this in any way hold up my work, for I am applying myself to various parts of the book in turn. In fact, <i>privatim,</i> I began by writing <i>Capital</i> in a sequence (starting with the 3rd, historical section<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> ) quite the reverse of that in which it was presented to the public, saving only that the first volume—the last I tackled—was got ready for the press straight away, whereas the two others remained in the rough form which all research originally assumes.</p>
<p>I enclose a photograph herewith, because the copy of the French edition that goes off to you at the same time as this letter only contains a very far from flattering likeness done from a London photograph by a Parisian artist.</p>
<p>Your most obedient Servant,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

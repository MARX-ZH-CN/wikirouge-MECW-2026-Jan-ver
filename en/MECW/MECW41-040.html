MARX TO COLLET DOBSON COLLET<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>IN LONDON
<br>Manchester, 7 March 1860<br>6 Thorncliffe Grove, Oxford Road
<br>My dear Sir,
<br>Having been absent from here for a few days, I was prevented answering your letter immediately.
<br>As to the Printers' Bill,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> which I had taken the liberty to ask you for in a letter addressed to you on the 6th of February<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> (if I am not mistaken), you have forgotten transmitting it to me. Pray, send it to Mrs Marx.
<br>As to Schaible's declaration (<i>extorted</i> by my proceedings against Blind<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> ), it will be sufficient to remark:
<br>1st) Whether Blind be the <b>literary</b> author of the fly-sheet, is a question I have not to deal with. He <i>is</i> the author in the <i>legal</i> sense of the word.
<br>Schaible's declaration (which 'circumstances', he says in the <i>Telegraph,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> prevented him for three months from making, but which I extorted <i>in no time</i> by sending to <i>Louis Blanc</i> a copy of the two <i>Affidavits</i> at the Bowstreet Police-Court) proves much <i>against</i> Vogt. It proves nothing <i>for</i> Blind. It does not exculpate him in any respect. He has <i>written</i> (if not <i>drawn up</i>) the manuscript; he has <i>printed</i> it in Hollinger's office; he <i>paid</i> Hollinger's Printer's Bill; he made <i>two false</i> declarations in the Augsburg Gazette<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> ; he and Hollinger entered into <i>conspiracy</i> against me in order to induce (and with what success you know) the compositor Wiehe to give them <i>false</i> evidence. This is not all. Blind, as you know from the letter he addressed in September to Liebknecht, had the cool impudence of stating that he had <i>nothing at all</i> to do with the whole affair. Lastly, all the successive steps now taken by him and Schaible were <i>forced</i> upon him by the menace suspended over his head for a criminal action for 'conspiracy'.
<br>2) Dr Schaible may, for aught I know, have allowed himself to be made Blind's scape-goat. He, as I know, belongs so to say to the household furniture of Blind's.
<br>3) The principal political end I aimed at, has been obtained by Schaible's declaration. It makes void and annuls the proceedings at Augsburg,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> —mere mock proceedings; there being present no witnesses, no accuser, no (real) accused, and, in point of fact, <i>no tribunal,</i> since Vogt, in his wisdom, had appealed <i>not</i> to <i>that</i> description of Bavarian tribunal which, according to the Bavarian law, <i>had</i> to decide on the case. In respect to this same Vogt, it will suffice to say that at <i>Geneva,</i> his own place of residence, a Swiss paper (<i>Die Neue Schweizer Zeitung, The New Swiss Gazette,</i> in its number of <i>November 12, 1859</i>) has declared to have indignantly repulsed Vogt's attempt at bribing it with <i>French</i> money.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> That same paper, in a leading article, called upon Vogt to take judicial proceedings against itself, same way as I, in a declaration signed with my name, and published in the <i>Augsburg Gazette</i> and the <i>Hamburg 'Reform',</i> had called upon him to sue the <i>Volk</i> at London.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> Vogt, although a Genevese <i>Ständerath</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> and, therefore, a public servant, rested mute to these appeals, while enlisting the favour of the stupid German Liberals by the Augsburg comedy, or rather <i>farce.</i>
<br>You will be so kind to <i>consider this letter as confidential,</i> since the lawyers who carry on my actions for libel at Berlin and London, think it fit that, except on the most urgent emergency, I should not break my silence until <i>after</i> the judicial proceedings have been closed.
<br>Yours faithfully
<br>K. Marx

<p>JENNY MARX (DAUGHTER) TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN</p>
<p>IN HANOVER</p>
<p>[London,] 17 July 1870</p>
<p>My dear Doctor,</p>
<p>I hope you do not think that laziness or negligence has had anything to do with my silence. The fact is, that I no sooner received your letter than I wrote to Mr Pigott, the editor of <i>The Irishman</i> to enquire of him where I could obtain a photograph of O'Donovan Rossa.

Indeed, the Prison Enquiry is solely got up for the purpose of hushing up the unpleasant truths that were oozing out. On the eve of the Enquiry, the pretended object of which is to elucidate things, the prisoners are more <i>closely guarded than ever,</i> lest they might inform their friends of the treatment they are undergoing. A few days ago Mrs Luby, wife of one of the prisoners, visited her husband to bear to him the tidings of his mother's death, (grief for her son's sufferings hastened Mrs Luby's death) and though the unfortunate woman had not seen her husband since <i>three</i> years, she was not allowed to see him face to face without the intrusion of a jailor.

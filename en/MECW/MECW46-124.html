MARX TO ENGELS
<br>IN LONDON
<br>[Postcard]
<br>[Algiers,] 23 March, Thursday [1882]
<br>DEAR FRED,
<br>Just now — after BREAKFAST—MY HELP<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> lanced, etc., the dense throng of greatly distended blisters produced on one side of my chest by yesterday's embrocation; after which [he told] me to idle away another hour or two in bed; so here I am scribbling a few lines on this postcard, as there's no time to be lost; for a messenger from this house is leaving for Algiers at an unusually early hour in order to take letters to the post office there, etc. (There's no post to France on Mondays and Wednesdays.)
<br>Ever since Tuesday (21 March) another storm has been raging night and day save for the usual INTERVALS — thunder, not much lightning, downpours in the evening and particularly at night, <i>today in the morning as well.</i> As the storm approached on Tuesday afternoon, presaged by a SKY SO overcast, pitch-black and lowering, I was particularly struck by the rôle the TRULY AFRICAN SIROCCO played in the said storm.— Dr Stephann here yesterday; EXAMINATION <i>satisfactory;</i> progress; still <i>peccans</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> [are] a place at the <i>very bottom</i> of one side of my chest and a corresponding place on my back. Next week (i. e. ABOUT Wednesday or Thursday of next week), my HELP is to refrain from embrocating those spots; so Stephann is specially reserving this for himself.
<br>Regards to all.
<br>Your
<br>Moor

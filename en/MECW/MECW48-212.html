ENGELS TO HERMANN ENGELS</p>
<p>IN ENGELSKIRCHEN</p>
<p>Eastbourne, 22 August 1889<br>
4 Cavendish Place</p>
<p>Dear Hermann,</p>
<p>The statement of account received with thanks; no doubt it will be correct.</p>
<p>Would you be so kind as to forward the enclosed note to young or now, I suppose, old Caspar<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> —I don't know whether he lives in Krefeld or Barmen. As I learn from R. Blank, whom I ran into here a week ago, things aren't going too well with those chaps; if so, I am sorry.</p>
<p>I have been here a fortnight but am, alas, having more rain than I can do with. Ever since the English have begun holding their naval manoeu- vres in August, the weather during that month has been truly atrocious and yesterday the words of the old song came true here:</p>
<p>On <i>21 August,</i> just gone by, <i>In storm and rain</i> there came a spy, Who tidings to the prince did give, etc.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In consequence of which three big warships sailed past this morning, but we still await the famous naval battle which is to take place in the Channel, before our very eyes.</p>
<p>I shall probably be staying here another fortnight or three weeks, if the rain isn't too bad, for</p>
<p>'Back to my home I cannot go', the place being full of whitewashers, paperers, painters and other work- men, who make three-quarters of the rooms uninhabitable and, once they're in the house, you never know when you'll be rid of them again. This is because in England large-scale industry has ruined the crafts but has not been able to find anything else to put in their place. For a long time now the Germans have not had the sole prerogative of providing shoddy wares in return for good money; the Londoners have a positively stunning aptitude for this. In America, however, it's altogether different. So far as ordinary, everyday business dealings are concerned, in which no speculation is involved, America is, I believe, the most reliable country in the world—the only one in which you will still find 'good workmanship'.</p>
<p>I trust you are all well. Much love to Emma<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> and to the children and grandchildren, as well as to the rest of the Engels-kirchen, from</p>
<p>Your old</p>
<p>Friedrich

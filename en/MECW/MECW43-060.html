ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Bridlington Quay, 22 August 1868</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Best thanks for the <i>Lanterne</i> and the B. Becker.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> The closer one comes to see the details of the Lassalle tragicomedy, the more the comical side emerges. This man was ruined by his IRREPRESSIBLE reflection upon himself, his permanent self-contemplation. 'How do I appear to myself?' was the eternal refrain. Poor Baron Izzy! Comic at that exalted moment when he commissioned his <i>alter ego,</i> Rüstow, to bed the beautiful Helen<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <i>per procura</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> if necessary—he well knew how little danger this involved—as at that other moment when the Wallachian<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> shot away his genitals. Poor Izzy! To be gelded by a shot from a Wallachian.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> You always found it so comical that his <i>gob</i> had been stopped, but now <i>this</i> as well.</p>
<p>Seiler! That is the impression of the whole story. Sebastian Seiler, the only worthy historiographer of this tragicomedy—he will hang himself that he missed this putrid scene. <i>En attendant</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> it is quite amusing that the 'testamentary successor of Lassalle'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> declares him an aristocrat, traitor and cad, and is forced to appropriate all those things that we formerly had published <i>against him himself</i> and against Schweitzer.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> Bastards!</p>
<p>On Wednesday or Thursday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> I shall go back to Manchester from here and shall then visit my mother for a week—probably in Ostend. I am still waiting for a letter from her, and have no idea where I stand in the meantime.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Naturally I would have sent the money for the loan from the insurance company <i>only to you,</i> if you had not from the start shoved the whole affair away from you and onto Borkheim, so that I had to turn to him simply to find out how much had to be paid. <i>That</i> I could, of course, only do with the simultaneous remark that I would send the sum to him, since he was indeed standing surety for the money. As I already wrote to you, it would never have occurred to me to send the money to that jackass Schyler.<sup>g</sup> But I expect to see you before then, in London at the end of next week.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

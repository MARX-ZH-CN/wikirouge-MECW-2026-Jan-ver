<p>Dear Marx,</p>
<p>Herewith:</p>
<p>1. The list of the shares so far subscribed for, 14 in number.</p>
<p>2. A proxy for you.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>3. One for d'Ester (Bohnstedt is an acquaintance of his).</p>
<p>4. One for Bürgers.</p>
<p>It was unavoidable that Bohnstedt and Hecker should have given their proxies to personal acquaintances.</p>
<p>Hühnerbein will appear there in person on behalf of himself and two others here.</p>
<p>The list is not yet closed. Although I have called on Laverrière and Blank x times, I haven't found them at home. Zulauff has taken over the former.</p>
<p>Two others, with whom I made no headway, will be worked upon by Hecker.</p>
<p>Today Zulauff is going to Ronsdorf, where he has good prospects.</p>
<p>The two kinds of people who prove the most difficult are, firstly, the republicans in kid gloves [a nickname of the moderate bourgeois republicans in France, followers of Armand Marrast], who fear for their fortunes and smell communism in the air and, secondly, the local panjandrums, who regard us as rivals.</p>
<p>Neither Nohl nor Bracht were to be persuaded. Of the jurists, Bohnstedt is the only one with whom anything can be done. All in all we've made fruitless moves enough.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I am going to Engelskirchen for 2 days. Let me know at once the results of the shareholders' meeting.</p>
<p>A beginning has also been made with a community of the [Communist] League.</p>
<p>Your<br>Engels

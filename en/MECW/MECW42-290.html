<p><b>Dear Fred</b><i>,</i></p>
<p>I see that I did not enclose the 2 letters from Borkheim for you. But it is not really necessary. Yesterday we had the 'discussion' he desired. He has reverted to the idea (which I suggested to him 2 months ago) of a loan from the 'Atlas' Life Assurance Company, whose secretary is a friend of his. I completed the papers yesterday at his house. You only figure as a <b>reference</b> on them. £150 (of which Borkheim would receive £45), repayable on 1 September.</p>
<p>I no longer have any faith in the success of Borkheim's operations. <i>I have no doubt about his good will.</i></p>
<p>Have you received his '<i>Pearl</i>'? (French and German so far).</p>
<p>Important letter from Schily enclosed. Please send it back <i>by return;</i> give your opinion at the same time. Whatever happens I shall not permit Moses to derive 'profit' from my work without profiting to some extent from it myself.</p>
<p>I am having to be diplomatic about Fenianism. I cannot keep entirely silent, but under no circumstances do I want the fellows, when criticising my book [Capital], to confine themselves to the statement that I am a demagogue.</p>
<p>I am <i>sending</i> you Borkheim's <i>Gentz</i> (important for the article on Russia) without his knowledge. Please return it to me as soon as you have finished.</p>
<p>I now have a rash of furuncles more or less all over, and am glad of it. It puts paid to the carbuncle malady.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your<br>Moro
</p>
<ul><li>My compliments to Mrs Burns. Jenny goes in black since the Manchester execution, and wears her Polish cross on a <i>green</i> ribbon.*</li></ul>

ENGELS TO MARIA MENDELSON</p>
<p>LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 7 February 1893<br>
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Madame Mendelson,</p>
<p>A thousand thanks for the trouble you have taken to translate the two articles for me.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>As for the <i>warning</i>—<i>ostrzezenie</i>—I had already deci- phered it with the help of a Polish dictionary that I inherited from Marx. And the <i>Gazeta Robotnicza</i> has really been of unexpected assistance in my Polish studies—you say that the Polish in this newssheet is too German. Then it is like the Russian of Lavrov, and that explains why the Russian of the one and the Polish of the other present me with so few difficulties. I am indeed making progress, and if I had time to apply myself seriously to it for three months, I would venture to garble in Polish.</p>
<p>I will try to make use of your manuscripts—in the meantime I would ask you to let me know if I may publish the facts contained in your letter on the Moscow students and Russian officers—without, of course, revealing the source of my information.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Kind regards from Mme Kautsky.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F. Engels

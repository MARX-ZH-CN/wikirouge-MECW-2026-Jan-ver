ENGELS TO A. GOUPPY</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London,] 14 June 1875</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>If my memory serves me right, I have seen you only once in my life. Hence it was not without some surprise that I read your suggestion that I should stand surety for you in the sum of £100. In any case, I must forewarn you that I am not in a position to undertake any guarantees for anyone at all.</p>
<p>As for the Dupont children, I explicitly declared to Dupont before his departure that if he were to go to America and leave them in England, he would be doing so at his own risk and peril; that, having advanced him more than a hundred pounds for their maintenance and education, I could do nothing further; and that, in consequence, he could in no way count on obtaining my help again. This I can only repeat to you. Having done all that I could for these poor children,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> there can be absolutely no question of my making any further sacrifices on their behalf.</p>
<p>Respectfully yours, etc.

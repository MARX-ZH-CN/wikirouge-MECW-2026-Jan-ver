ENGELS TO HARRY QUELCH</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London,] 2 April 1895</p>
<p>Dear Comrade,</p>
<p>I have been compelled to decline, at least for this year, all demands for contributions to extra numbers of periodicals both for 18 March and 1st May, and am therefore unable to make an exception in the shape of an 'winterview' for <i>Justice.</i> This, however, does not mean that I should not be quite willing, if you should wish it, to discuss with you <i>privately</i> and in a friendly way the progress and the present position of the movement, in England and out of England.</p>
<p>If this should meet your views and you will be good enough to propose a day and hour when you could call, I will try to arrange to be at home.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully
</p>

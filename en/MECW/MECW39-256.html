MARX TO MORITZ ELSNER
<br>IN BRESLAU
<br>London, Wednesday, 20 December 1854 28 Dean Street, Soho Dear Eisner,
<br>Your letter arrived here on Monday. I myself only got back today after spending a few days visiting Engels and Lupus in Manchester.
<br><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>I shall begin work as correspondent on <i>Saturday</i>. To start off right in the middle of the <i>final part</i> of the 'preliminary' parliamentary session WOULD NOT DO. A <i>resume</i> of this short session would make a better <i>entrée</i>. For the past two years I have been writing—i.e. for publication—only in English. German may give me some trouble at the start.
<br>As you are aware, I edited a Prussian newspaper<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <i>under censorship</i>—for a whole year. So I am quite familiar with the torments which the <i>Neue Oder-Zeitung</i> may have to endure under a new form of censorship, and it is these difficulties, the UNDERHAND struggle AGAINST THE ESTABLISHED POWERS which incline me to work in the interest of this paper.
<br>So far as I am aware, and I know pretty well all the important reading-rooms in London, the <i>N.O.-Z.</i> is not available in any of them. Hence, for the time being, you'll have to send it direct to me. I might perhaps be able to introduce it into a reading-room or
<br>COFFEE-ROOM.
<br>You would particularly oblige me if, by way of an exception, you could send me <i>one</i> issue of the <i>Breslauer Zeitung</i>. Although Edgar Bauer comes to see me every week, he has never spoken about his articles and I would like to get to know his views from one 'sample'.
<br>Since Parliament will be going into recess, and—save for a <i>resume</i> of its sessions and PERHAPS of FINANCIAL MATTERS—there will be little of importance to report, I shall, if these premises hold good, write a number of consecutive articles providing a review of the conduct of the war in the Crimea so far,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> concerning which I have seen nothing sensible, i.e. critical, either here or from Germany. Moreover, I suppose that this subject is of the greatest general interest and at the same time least liable to lead to a conflict with the indirect Royal Prussian Censorship.
<br>Requesting you to convey my kindest regards to your wife whom I have not had the pleasure of meeting.
<br>Yours
<br>K. Marx

This marked the beginning of Marx's collaboration with this newspaper (see Note 603)</span>

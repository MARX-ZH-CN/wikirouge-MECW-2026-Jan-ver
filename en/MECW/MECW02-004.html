<p>Note from MECW vol. 2, 1975 :
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As can be seen from <a href="MECW02-066.html">Engels' letter to his sister Marie of March 12, 1839</a>, this poem was sent to <i>Der Bremer Stadtbote</i> in a fuller version. The publication of Th. Hildebrandt's poem <i>Book Wisdom</i> was mentioned in the <i>Bremer Wöchentliche Nachrichten</i> No. 36, 2. Beilage, S. 2, for March 25, 1839. However, the Publishers do not possess a copy of <i>Der Bremer Stadtbote</i> containing this poem.

<p>He is not wise who from his reading draws<br>Nothing but floods of useless erudition.<br>For all his learning, life's mysterious laws<br>Are a closed book beyond his comprehension.<br>He who acquires a thorough textbook grounding<br>In Botany, won't hear the grass that grows.<br>Nor will he ever teach true understanding<br>Who tells you all the dogma that he knows.<br>Oh, no! The germ lies hid in man's own heart.<br>Who seeks the art of life must look within.<br>Burning the midnight oil will not impart<br>The secret of emotion's discipline.<br>The man is lost who hears his own heart's voice<br>And spurns it, wilfully misapprehending.<br>Of all your words so noble and so wise<br>The most profound is human understanding.</p>
<p><br>
Th. Hildebrandt

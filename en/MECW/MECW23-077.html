<blockquote>
<p>Engels wrote about the formation of the Lodi Section in October 1872, the Rules of which corresponded to the General Rules of the International, to the General Secretary Friedrich Sorge in his letter of November 2, 1872. On December 22, the General Council accepted the section into the International on Engels' proposal. In early 1873, the section ceased its activity because of police persecution.

<p>It is with great pleasure that I have received the news of your formation as a section of the International, and I have immediately informed the new General Council in New York. I append below the address for direct correspondence with the General</p>
<p>Council, while I remain always at your disposal for any information, clarification or service you may desire.</p>
<p>Fraternal greetings,</p>
<p>Frederick Engels

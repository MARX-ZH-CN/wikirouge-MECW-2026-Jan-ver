ENGELS TO FERDINAND WOLFF</p>
<p>IN OXFORD <i>[Draft]</i></p>
<p>[London,] end of October 1893</p>
<p>You write to say that 'I have disclosed...'. I do not know what hoary piece of gossip you are referring to and indeed this is a matter of the utmost indifference to me. But when you start talking pompously about your 'silence', it evidently implies the threat that you might now break that silence. In which case you have met your match. If it really is your intention to threaten me, I have only one answer and that is: 'do your worst'. I don't care two hoots whether you speak or hold your tongue.</p>
<p>But what I cannot understand at all in how you came to write me such an inane letter.</p>
<p>I can find me explanation for it other than the state of nervous tension you are in. Otherwise you would realise that such conduct would debar me absolutely from having any further contact with you until you have rehabilitated yourself in my eyes.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

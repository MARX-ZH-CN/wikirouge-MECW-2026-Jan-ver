ENGELS TO FERDINAND DOMELA NIEUWENHUIS</p>
<p>IN THE HAGUE</p>
<p>London, 29 December 1881<br>
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Comrade,</p>
<p>I am glad to be able to inform you that the news according to which Karl Marx is mortally sick is wholly false and fictitious. He has now got over his illness (bronchitis and pleurisy) and, on the advice of his doctors, has today left for Ventnor (the Isle of Wight); they hope that the warm climate and dry air there will rapidly complete his recovery. I will forward your letter to him.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>F. Engels

- RECIPIENT: Karl Marx
- DATE: December 12, 1867
<br>Scanning the input text, I can see:
1. A letter fragment ending with "F. E." signature (Friedrich Engels), which must be the letter to Marx from December 12, 1867
2. "ENGELS TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN" dated December 13, 1867 (which says "Pursuant to mine humbly of yesterday" - referring to the December 12 letter)
<br>The first letter fragment is the target (to Marx, December 12), but its header is cut off in the input. The second letter (to Kugelmann, December 13) must be deleted.

ENGELS TO MARX
<br>[Manchester, 12 December 1867]
<br>In his letter to Marx of 23 November 1867, Ludwig Kugelmann criticised Liebknecht's point of view, emphasising that in practice this would give such people as the Lassallean Schweitzer and the conservative Wagener complete control over the social issue and the possibility of using it for demagogical aims. You will recall, incidentally, that I was already telling you last autumn that he had become too much of an <i>Austrian</i> owing to his hatred of the Prussians.
<br>This brief epistle just to keep you informed. The articles<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> will follow in a few days time, and you can then at all events tell the Lieutenant-Colonel<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> that there will be a few more, and there will then be something for him to do.
<br>In friendship
<br>Yours
<br>F. E.
<br>I have just been ejected from the office, as it was closing time.

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE</p>
<p>AT LE PERREUX</p>
<p>London, 19 December 1891</p>
<p>My dear Laura,</p>
<p>Today I have just the time to inform you that the box with the usual pudding, cake, etc., has been safely forwarded by the usual in- strumentality yesterday and hope will reach you safely and in time.</p>
<p>20th December. You see I had <i>not</i> 'just the time' yesterday, for the dinner-bell called me off, it being 5.20 and only ten minutes to spare before closing of mail — so I thought it better to wait till today.</p>
<p>Schorlemmer cannot come this Christmas, and Pumps and family, whom I saw at Ryde for a few days last week, are in the same posi- tion. So then it struck me; would it not be a bit of a change and rest for you and Paul to come over and take possession of the top front bedroom for a week or so? Surely you must want some interruption of that restless sort of life which Paul's election 33° and its consequences have thrown you both into. And the bright skies of Paris must make you long for a good old-fashioned London fog such as is now overhang- ing me. So I do hope you will make up your minds, and if Paul should have engagements up to Christmas, you might come first, and he fol- low next week to spend at least the passage from '91 to '92 with us.</p>
<p>In the meantime I must not forget 'the compliments of the season' and the old-established form in which I ought to present them to you, namely the enclosed bit of pink paper which I hope you will do me the kindness to accept.</p>
<p>Schorlemmer is still suffering from deafness but hopes to be cured, if he can keep free from colds this winter. So I have not the heart to press him, especially as his ear-doctor says he always comes back from London worse than he went.</p>
<p>I am glad Paul has deposed a motion on the separation of Church and State. In his first speech, it appears to me as if the violent inter- ruptions from all sides had prevented him from developing clearly and unmistakably what he intended to say, and that the Dumays and Radicals 14<sup>?</sup> and even Floquet tried to use that as a peg to hang on their cheap criticisms. This motion will re-establish clearness.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>My dear Laura, the fog is getting so perfect that I must give up writing in order not to ruin my eyes — writing by gas-light being still strictly prohibited. So in the hope of soon learning that you are get- ting ready for the road, and with kind regards from Louise, I remain</p>
<p>ever yours,</p>
<p>F. Engels

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">On 17 December 1891 Paul Lafargue, on behalf of the French Workers' Party, submitted to the Chamber of Deputies a bill on the separation of the Church from the State, which was, by and large, based on the decree of the Paris Commune of 2 April 1871. It envisaged the cancellation of the cults budget, the confiscation of Church property, with the means thus obtained to be used for popular education and social security, and a ban on the building of churches and the involvement of workers in religious societies. The bill was published in<i> Le Socialiste,</i> No. 66, 26 December 1891.<br>Lafargue's maiden speech in the Chamber of Deputies (8 December 1891) was a substantiation of his bill on a full amnesty for persons charged with political of fences. The speech was repeatedly interrupted by noise and heckling from bour geois deputies. It was published verbatim in<i> Le Socialiste,</i> No. 65, 19 December 1891.</span>

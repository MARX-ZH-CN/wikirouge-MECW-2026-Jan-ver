<br>Adolphe Hubert – French emigrant in London, member of First International – Progress Publishers.

</blockquote>
<br><i>To Adolphe Hubert in London</i>
<br>... The public prosecutor of Versailles has drawn up a grotesque indictment against the <em>International</em>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> In the interest of the defence it may perhaps be useful to communicate the following facts to Mr Bigot.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>1) Enclosed herein (marked No 1) are the two Addresses of the <em>General Council</em> on the Franco-Prussian War.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> In its first Address, dated 23 July 1870, the <em>General Council</em> declared that the war was not the handiwork of the people of France but of the Empire and that basically Bismarck was as guilty as Bonaparte. At the same time the General Council appealed to the German workers not to let the Prussian Government change the war of defence into a war of conquest.
<br>2) The second Address, of 9 September 1870 (five days after the proclamation of the republic), is a very emphatic denunciation of the Prussian government's plans of conquest. It is an appeal to the German and English workers <em>to take the part of the French Republic</em>.
<br>As a matter of fact the workers in Germany belonging to the <em>International Association</em> opposed Bismarck's policy so vigorously that he had the principal German representatives of the <em>International</em> illegally arrested and cast into Prussian fortresses on the trumped-up charge of 'conspiring' with the enemy.
<br>In response to the appeal of the Council, the English workers held large meetings in London to force their government to recognise the French Republic and to oppose the dismemberment of France with all its strength.
<br>3) Does the French government now ignore the support which the <em>International</em> gave France during the war? On the contrary. M Jules Favre's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> consul in Vienna, M Lefaivre, has even committed the indiscretion of publishing, in the name of the French government, a letter of thanks to Messrs Liebknecht and Bebel, the two representatives of the <em>International</em> in the German Reichstag. In that letter he said among other things (I shall retranslate it from a German version of Lefaivre's letter): 'You, gentlemen, and your party [that is to say, the <em>International</em>] have upheld the great German tradition [that is, the humanitarian spirit], etc.'
<br>Well, this letter figures in the criminal proceedings for <em>high treason</em> which the Saxon government was forced by Bismarck to institute against Liebknecht and Bebel and which are still going on at this moment. It served Bismarck as a pretext for having Bebel arrested after the adjournment of the German Reichstag.
<br>At the very time when the villainous press denounced me to Thiers as an agent of Bismarck, Bismarck imprisoned my friends for being guilty of high treason against Germany and gave orders to arrest me should I set foot on German soil.
<br>4) Some time before the armistice<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> the worthy Jules Favre – as the General Council declared in a letter to the <em>Times</em> of <em>12 June</em>, a reprint of which is hereby enclosed (No II)  – asked us through his private secretary, Dr Reitlinger, to arrange public demonstrations in London in favour of the 'Government of Defence'. Reitlinger added, as the General Council said in its letter to the <em>Times</em>, that one should not speak of the '<em>Republic</em>' but only of 'France'. The General Council refused to give any assistance to demonstrations <em>of this sort</em>. But all this proves that the French Government itself considered the <em>International</em> an ally of the French Republic against the Prussian conqueror – and it was indeed the only ally France had during the war.

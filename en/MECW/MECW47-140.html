ENGELS TO PASQUALE MARTIGNETTI</p>
<p>IN BENEVENTO</p>
<p>London, 30 December 1884</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Unfortunately it is not till now that your latest letter dated 18 November has received a reply from me. Please excuse me; I am overwhelmed with work and things to be done.</p>
<p>My <i>Peasant War</i> is a pamphlet which is only of interest to Germany. Besides, I must prepare a completely reworked edition, and I cannot begin before February or March. The book would be published around July (I know what to expect from our party press). Finally, what it deals with has nothing to do with the subject of <i>The Origin etc.</i><sup>b</sup></p>
<p>I think therefore that it will be better to publish the latter separately; as for the way in which it is published, I leave the decision entirely in your hands.</p>
<p>As soon as <i>The Peasant War</i> is published, I shall be honoured to send you a copy. You can then judge whether it is worth the trouble of translating. I doubt it.</p>
<p>I remain with respect your devoted</p>
<p>F. Engels

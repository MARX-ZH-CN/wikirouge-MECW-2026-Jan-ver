ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Ramsgate, Wednesday,<br>
12 August [1874]</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p><i>Peasant War</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> received with thanks. Be so good and write at once a few lines about how you are, if you have not done so already. Jenny<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> has heard from Longuet that your leg is not all it should be and she is so worried about it that yesterday she was talking about going back to see you. The sea is visibly doing her good, the bathing is also good for her and her cough is gone, as far as I can judge. Unfortunately, she is still suffering from insomnia somewhat, and I do not know what to do about that except to advise her to try and snatch a little sleep after meals, which she has just done with success.</p>
<p>In general, it would be good if you could write to her more frequently; you know how much she is attached to you.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

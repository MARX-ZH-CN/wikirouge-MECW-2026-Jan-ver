ENGELS TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN</p>
<p>IN HANOVER</p>
<p>London, 12 October 1877</p>
<p>Dear Kugelmann,</p>
<p>I am writing in great haste (I have a chemist from Mannheim<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and a university lecturer from Munich staying with me) to inform you as requested that I have received your letter and that, if I have the time and am able to do so, I shall gladly supply Mr Ecker with information as soon as I know more precisely what he wants of me.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I doubt if I can be of much help to him, for a perfect working man's dwelling, which on the one hand meets all the sanitary, etc., requirements and on the other won't cost the working man too much, is, as you know, like a triangular square.</p>
<p>We are getting on pretty well here; Marx has been at Neuenahr,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> for the moment his liver is back to normal, his nerves are better, hence also his nights and, but for his being such a prey to colds, there would be little to complain of. I myself am very well; loafed about a lot during the summer, on top of which there have been numerous visitors, but I think I shall be able to get back to work next week.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. Engels

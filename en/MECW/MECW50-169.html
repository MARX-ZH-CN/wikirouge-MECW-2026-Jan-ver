ENGELS TO FILIPPO TURATI</p>
<p>IN MILAN</p>
<p>London, 12 April 1894 122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Turati,</p>
<p>I am sending you by post the Anglo-American edition <i>{Discourse on Free Trade. 358</i> K. Marx) of your discourse, and the German translation of <i>The Poverty of Philosophy,</i> where you will find this speech in the appendix.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> As for the French text, this is to be reprinted in the Paris <i>L'Ère Nouvelle. 357</i> There is only one copy of the French text, namely mine, and if it is lost there will be no way to replace it. I therefore still do not know how to send it to Paris, for if I have a copy made here, this will mean loss of time, and I have too much experience of the post to entrust the original to it.</p>
<p>The 2<sup>nd</sup> volume of <i>Capital</i> came but in Hamburg, published by <i>Otto Meissner,</i> as the 1<sup>st</sup> was, in 1893 (2<sup>nd</sup> edition). If I am not mistaken, the price is 6 marks. The same publishers are to issue the 3<sup>rd</sup> volume in September, to the great pleasure of the illustrious Achille Loria, a charlatan who warned everyone that Marx had never written this 3<sup>rd</sup> volume, but was always referring the reader to it simply to make a fool of him. 360</p>
<p>Kindest regards from myself and Mme Freyberger (ex Kautsky, she has just married a young Austrian doctor living here) to Mme Kulishov.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F. Engels

<blockquote>
<p>This document dates from the time of Engels' stay in Switzerland after the defeat of the Baden-Palatinate uprising (see Note 133). At first Engels lived in Vevey, then in the latter half of August 1849 moved to Lausanne. In his letters of August 1,17 and 23, 1849, Marx invited Engels to London to take part in publishing the journal Neue Rheinische Zeitung. Politisch-ökonomische Revue, as well as in reorganising the ( ommunist League. When he received his permit to leave Switzerland, Engels decided to travel to England via Italy, since the French authorities refused him the right of transit through France. On October 6, 1849, he sailed from Genoa, and after a five-week voyage around the Iberian Peninsula, reached London some time around November 10. (Note from MECW)

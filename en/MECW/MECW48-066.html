<p>TO JOHANNES WEISS IN LONDON<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London, about 10 October 1887]</p>
<p><br>
Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Having carefully considered the matter, I regret to say that it is not within my means to do as you ask and advance you a sum that would put you in a position to complete your studies. As you will be able to imagine without my expressly assuring you of the fact, I have for years been subjected to demands from every possible quarter—and not just Germany and England—in an ever increasing number of cases, these being for the most part cases from which, for private or party consider- ations, I cannot possibly dissassociate myself. In this way I have contracted such a vast quantity of permanently recurring liabilities that I am myself in some perplexity—particularly at this moment—as to how I am to meet them. So much so, indeed, that were I now to tie up a sum such as you desire for, say, 2 or 3 years, I would patently find myself unable to meet those obligations into which I have already entered. This being so, I am forced to look at your proposal from a wholly busi- nesslike point of view and this, unfortunately, leaves me no alternative but to say again how sorry I am that to comply with your wishes would be quite beyond my means.</p>
<p>Trusting that you will succeed in obtaining the money in question elsewhere, I remain,</p>
<p>Yours faithfully
</p>

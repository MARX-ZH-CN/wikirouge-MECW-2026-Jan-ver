<blockquote>
<p>The New Madrid Federation (see Note 157) published this letter together with the information that it had been recognised by the General Council of the International.</p>
<p>The letter was published in English for the first time in The General Council of the First International. 1871-1872. Minutes, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1968.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Executive Committee, entrusted by the General Council with temporarily carrying out all the administrative business of the Association,</p>
<p>in view of the New Madrid Federation's letter of August 5, requesting its recognition by the General Council;</p>
<p>in view of the Spanish regional Federal Council's resolution of July 16, refusing to admit the said federation;</p>
<p>considering that, formally, it would be absurd to share in this matter the attitude of a regional Federal Council, the majority of which are members of a secret society hostile to the International, and which the General Council intends opposing at the Congress; considering that, essentially, the founders of the New Madrid Federation are the very people who were the first in Spain to dare disassociate themselves from this secret society called the <i>Alliance of Socialist Democracy</i>, and disclose and thwart its schemes.</p>
<p>For these reasons,</p>
<p>the Executive Committee, on behalf of the General Council, has resolved to recognise the New Madrid Federation and enter into regular and direct relations with it.</p>
<p>London, August 15, 1872</p>
<p>In the name of the Executive Committee</p>
<p>Secretary for Spain,</p>
<p><i><b>Frederick Engels</b></i>

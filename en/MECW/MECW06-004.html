<p>According to the <i>Rheinischer-Beobachter</i> of January 18, issue No. 18, the <i>Trier'sche Zeitung</i> contains an announcement by the Editorial Board according to which, among a number of writers, Marx also is named as a contributor to this newspaper. In order to prevent any confusion I state that I have <i>never</i> written a <i>single</i> line for this paper, whose bourgeois philanthropic, by no means communist tendencies are entirely alien to me.</p>

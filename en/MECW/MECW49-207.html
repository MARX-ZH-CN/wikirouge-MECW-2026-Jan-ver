ENGELS TO JOHANN HEINRICH WILHELM DIETZ</p>
<p>IN STUTTGART</p>
<p>London, 5 May 1892</p>
<p>Dear Mr Dietz,</p>
<p>In response to your favour of 28 April an unbound copy of the <i>Condition of the Working-Class in England</i> went off to you on the 2nd inst. <i>by registered mail,</i> done up in a strong wrapper; I trust you have received it.</p>
<p>From what you say, it is not clear <i>how much</i> of a free hand Wigand has given you as regards publication in the Internationale Bibliothek 469 —whether for one edition of a stipulated size or for as many, over as long a period, as you and I may agree. To judge by your afore-mentioned letter, the latter would appear to be the case. I would be much obliged if you could let me have further details; in matters of business it is important for me to know what my position is.</p>
<p>Cordial regards,</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F. Engels

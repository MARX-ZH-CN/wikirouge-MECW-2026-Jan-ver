ENGELS TO HENRY WILLIAM LEE
<br>IN LONDON
<br>[London], 16 April 1894
<br>H. W. Lee. Secretary<br>
Social Democratic Federation
<br>Dear Comrade,
<br>Both you and the party who suggested to you the idea of my lecturing for you, 361 must have been aware that I have so far made it a rule not to lecture anywhere. But apart from that, I find myself in a peculiar position with regard to you, that is, if I rightly understand your letter, the Social Democratic Federation. 44
<br>You cannot ignore that for a long series of years and up to a comparatively recent period, <i>Justice,</i> the organ of the S.D.F., has constantly attacked me and brought all sorts of charges against me. While no attempt has ever been made to prove these charges, they have never been withdrawn. Nor has the S.D.F. ever disclaimed any responsibility for what <i>Justice</i> wrote. In consequence I have been compelled to keep entirely aloof from the S.D.F. and do not see how I can change my attitude unless that difficulty is entirely removed.
<br>Yours faithfully,
<br>F. E.

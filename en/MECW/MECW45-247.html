MARX TO HUGO HELLER<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>[IN OXFORD]
<br>[Extract]
<br>[London,] 29 January 1879
<br>Dear Friend,
<br>... You would oblige me by copying for me verbatim the passage in Busch [OR Buret?]<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> in which I am taxed with the bad taste of having preserved the life of the Champagne phiz...<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> 
<div class="mw-references-wrap"><ol class="references">
<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">This extract was first published, in German, in the catalogue<i> Sotheby Parke Bernet and C,</i> London, 1963, as item No. 247. The letter was said to take up half a page and was rendered in English, up to the passage published in this volume, as follows: Marx 'informing his correspondent that he sent off three copies of<i> Das Kapital</i> and received payment for them'. The letter was purchased by an agent of the Maggs Brothers auctioneers; its subsequent fate is unknown.</span>

<li id="cite_note-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-3">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Marx is replying TO HUGO HELLER's letter of 9 January 1879, which stated that in his work<i> Graf Bismarck und seine Leute während des Krieges mit Frankreich</i> (Bd. II, Leipzig, 1878, S. 159) 'court flatterer' Moritz Busch represented Marx as preserver of the late King's life (probably Frederick William IV). Hugo Heller added that 'Champagne was still the King's undoing'.<br>In his next letter, that of 10 February 1879, Heller apologised to Marx for misinterpreting this passage in Busch's book; in actual fact, the reference was not to Marx but to Mr Wiehr. Later, Heller copied out the pertinent passage and sent it on to Marx.</br></span>

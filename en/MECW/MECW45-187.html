MARX TO WILHELM BRACKE</p>
<p>IN BRUNSWICK</p>
<p>London, 8 August 1877</p>
<p>Dear Bracke,</p>
<p>Your letter received. I leave today.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> You will be getting a letter from me in a few days' time (perhaps even in two) directed to Ems <i>poste restante.</i></p>
<p><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Engels cannot be of service to you; he is at a seaside resort and will shortly be moving on, possibly to Jersey or the Isle of Man or elsewhere.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Such little time for work as he has at his disposal is, moreover,— under present circumstances—wholly spoken for.</p>
<p>As regards B. Becker, I must say that I <i>am totally opposed to his being entrusted in any way with Lissagaray's work</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> In Paris he abused me and Engels—not to speak of yourself—in no uncertain terms and now in London (where he has been for the past two months) has taken great care to keep out of my sight. His fury—as I had already heard from Paris—was due solely to your publishing Lissagaray's work! His insults and intrigues are a matter of complete indifference to me, but I cannot under any circumstances permit this individual to be mixed up in anything that has to do with Lissagaray.</p>
<p>As for Isolde,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> she seems to know more about extortion than translation.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>K. M.

The sample translation done by Julius Grunzig failed to satisfy Marx, as did that by Isolde Kurz. Although Marx was already overburdened with work, he had to spend a great deal of time and effort editing the translation. In the autumn of 1877, on Marx's and Engels' proposal, Wilhelm Bios was recruited as another editor. Lissagaray's book appeared in German in Brunswick late in 1877.— 155, 172, 189, 196, 222, 230, 262, 266, 285</span>

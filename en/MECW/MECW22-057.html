<p>ASSEMBLED AT LONDON FROM 17TH TO 23RD SEPTEMBER 1871</p>
<p>(CIRCULAR ISSUED BY THE GENERAL COUNCIL</p>
<p>OF THE ASSOCIATION)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
</center><center>
<p><b>I.</b></p>
<p>COMPOSITION OF GENERAL COUNCIL<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
</center><p>The Conference invites the General Council to limit the number of those members whom it adds to itself, and to take care that such adjunctions be not made too exclusively from citizens belonging to the same nationality.</p><center>
<p><b>II.</b></p>
<p>DESIGNATIONS OF NATIONAL COUNCILS,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> ETC.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
</center><p>1.— In conformity with a Resolution of the Congress of Basel (1869), the Central Councils of the various countries where the International is regularly organised, shall designate themselves henceforth as Federal Councils or Federal Committees with the names of their respective countries attached, the designation of General Council being reserved for the Central Council of the International Working Men's Association.</p>
<p>2.—All local branches, sections, groups and their committees are henceforth to designate and constitute themselves simply and exclusively as branches, sections, groups and committees of the International Working Men's Association with the names of their respective localities attached.</p>
<p>3.—Consequently, no branches, sections, or groups will henceforth be allowed to designate themselves by sectarian names such as Positivists, Mutualists, Collectivists, Communists, etc., or to form separatist bodies under the name of sections of propaganda etc., pretending to accomplish special missions, distinct from the common purposes of the Association.</p>
<p>
4.—Resolutions 1 and 2 do not, however, apply to affiliated Trades' Unions.</p><center>
<p><b>III.</b></p>
<p>DELEGATES OF THE GENERAL COUNCIL<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> </p>
</center><p>All delegates appointed to distinct missions by the General Council shall have the right to attend, and be heard at, all meetings of Federal Councils, or Committees, district and local Committees and branches, without, however, being entitled to vote thereat.</p><center>
<p><b>IV.</b></p>
<p>CONTRIBUTION OF lD.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> PER MEMBER TO THE GENERAL COUNCIL<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> </p>
</center><p>1.—The General Council shall cause to be printed adhesive stamps representing the value of one penny each, which will be annually supplied, in the numbers to be asked for, to the Federal Councils or Committees.</p>
<p>2.—The Federal Councils or Committees shall provide the local Committees, or, in their absence, their respective sections, with the number of stamps corresponding to the number of their members.</p>
<p>3.—These stamps are to be affixed to a special sheet of the livret or to the Rules which every member is held to possess.</p>
<p>4.—On the 1st of March of each year, the Federal Councils or Committees of the different countries shall forward to the General Council the amount of the stamps disposed of, and return the unsold stamps remaining on hand.</p>
<p>
5.—These stamps, representing the value of the individual contributions, shall bear the date of the current year.</p><center>
<p><b>V.</b></p>
<p>FORMATION OF WORKING WOMEN'S BRANCHES<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> </p>
</center><p>The Conference recommends the formation of female branches among the working class. It is, however, understood that this resolution does not at all interfere with the existence or formation of branches composed of both sexes.</p><center>
<p><b>VI.</b></p>
<p>GENERAL STATISTICS OF THE WORKING CLASS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> </p>
</center><p>1.—The Conference invites the General Council to enforce art. 5 of the original Rules relating to a general statistics of the working class, and the resolutions of the Geneva Congress, 1866,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> on the same subject.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> </p>
<p>2.—Every local branch is bound to appoint a special committee of statistics, so as to be always ready, within the limits of its means, to answer any questions which may be addressed to it by the Federal Council or Committee of its country, or by the General Council. It is recommended to all branches to remunerate the secretaries of the committees of statistics, considering the general benefit the working class will derive from their labour.</p>
<p>3.—On the first of August of each year the Federal Councils or Committees will transmit the materials collected in their respective countries to the General Council which, in its turn, will have to elaborate them into a general report, to be laid before the Congresses or Conferences annually held in the month of September.</p>
<p>
4.—Trades' Unions and international branches refusing to give the information required, shall be reported to the General Council which will take action thereupon.</p><center>
<p><b>VII.</b></p>
<p>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS OF TRADES'</p>
<p>UNIONS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> </p>
</center><p>The General Council is invited to assist, as has been done hitherto, the growing tendency of the Trades' Unions of the different countries to enter into relations with the Unions of the same trade in all other countries. The efficiency of its action as the international agent of communication between the national Trades' societies will essentially depend upon the assistance given by these same societies to the General Labour Statistics pursued by the International.
The boards of Trades' Unions of all countries are invited to keep the General Council informed of the directions of their respective offices.</p><center>
<p><b>VIII.</b></p>
<p>AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> </p>
</center><p>1.—The Conference invites the General Council and the Federal Councils or Committees to prepare, for the next Congress, reports on the means of securing the adhesion of the agricultural producers to the movement of the industrial proletariate. 
2.—Meanwhile, the Federal Councils or Committees are invited to send agitators to the rural districts, there to organise public meetings, to propagate the principles of the International and to found rural branches.</p><center>
<p><b>IX.</b></p>
<p>POLITICAL ACTION OF THE WORKING CLASS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup> </p>
</center><p>Considering the following passage of the preamble to the Rules:</p>
<p>"The economical emancipation of the working classes is the great end to which every political movement ought to be subordinate as a means ; "<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup> </p>
<p>That the Inaugural Address of the International Working Men's Association (1864) states: "The lords of land and the lords of capital will always use their political privileges for the defence and perpetuation of their economical monopolies. So far from promoting, they will continue to lay every possible impediment in the way of the emancipation of labour... To conquer political power has therefore become the great duty of the working classes;"<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup> </p>
<p>That the Congress of Lausanne (1867) has passed this resolution: "The social emancipation of the workmen is inseparable from their political emancipation;"<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup> </p>
<p>That the declaration of the General Council relative to the pretended plot of the French Internationals on the eve of the plebiscite (1870) says: "Certainly by the tenor of our Statutes, all our branches in England, on the Continent, and in America have the special mission not only to serve as centres for the militant organisation of the working class, but also to support, in their respective countries, every political movement tending towards the accomplishment of our ultimate end—the economical emancipation of the working class;"<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" id="cite_ref-18">[18]</a></sup> </p>
<p>That false translations of the original Statutes<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" id="cite_ref-19">[19]</a></sup> have given rise to various<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" id="cite_ref-20">[20]</a></sup> interpretations which were mischievous to the development and action of the International Working Men's Association<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" id="cite_ref-21">[21]</a></sup> ;</p>
<p>In presence of an unbridled reaction which violently crushes every effort at emancipation on the part of the working men, and pretends to maintain by brute force the distinction of classes and the political domination of the propertied classes resulting from it<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" id="cite_ref-22">[22]</a></sup> ;</p>
<p>Considering, that against this collective power of the propertied classes the working class cannot act, as a class, except by constituting itself into a political party, distinct from, and opposed to, all old parties formed by the propertied classes;</p>
<p>That this constitution of the working class into a political party is indispensable in order to insure the triumph of the social Revolution and its ultimate end—the abolition of classes;</p>
<p>That the combination of forces which the working class has already effected by its economical struggles ought at the same time to serve as a lever for its struggles against the political power of landlords and capitalists—<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23" id="cite_ref-23">[23]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The Conference recalls to the members of the International:</p>
<p>
That in the militant state of the working class, its economical movement and its political action are indissolubly united.</p><center>
<p><b>X.</b></p>
<p>GENERAL RESOLUTION AS TO THE COUNTRIES WHERE THE REGULAR</p>
<p>ORGANISATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL IS INTERFERED WITH BY</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENTS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24" id="cite_ref-24">[24]</a></sup> </p>
</center><p>In those countries where the regular organisation of the International may for the moment have become impracticable in consequence of government interference, the Association, and its local groups, may be reformed under various other names, but all secret societies properly so called are and remain formally excluded.</p><center>
<p><b>XI.</b></p>
<p>RESOLUTIONS RELATING TO FRANCE<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25" id="cite_ref-25">[25]</a></sup> </p>
</center><p>1.—The Conference expresses its firm conviction that all persecutions will only double the energy of the adherents of the International, and that the branches will continue to organize themselves, if not by great centres, at least by workshops and federations of workshops corresponding with each other by their delegates.
2.—Consequently, the Conference invites all branches vigorously to persist in the propaganda of our principles in France and to import into their country as many copies as possible of the publications and Statutes of the International.</p><center>
<p><b>XII.</b></p>
<p>RESOLUTION RELATING TO ENGLAND<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26" id="cite_ref-26">[26]</a></sup> </p>
</center><p>The Conference invites the General Council to call upon the English branches in London to form a Federal Committee for London which, after its recognition by the provincial branches and affiliated societies,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27" id="cite_ref-27">[27]</a></sup> shall be recognised, by the General Council, as the Federal Council for England.</p><center>
<p><b>XIII.</b></p>
<p>SPECIAL VOTES OF THE CONFERENCE<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28" id="cite_ref-28">[28]</a></sup> </p>
</center><p>1.—The Conference approves of the adjunction of the members of the Paris Commune whom the General Council has added to its number.</p>
<p>2.—The Conference declares that German working men have done their duty during the Franco-German war.</p>
<p>3.—The Conference fraternally thanks the members of the Spanish Federation for the memorandum presented by them on the organisation of the International by which they have once more proved their devotion to our common work.</p>
<p>
4.—The General Council shall immediately publish a declaration to the effect that the International Working Men's Association is utterly foreign to the so-called conspiracy of Netschayeff<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29" id="cite_ref-29">[29]</a></sup> who has fraudulently usurped<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30" id="cite_ref-30">[30]</a></sup> its name.</p><center>
<p><b>XIV.</b></p>
<p>INSTRUCTION TO CITIZEN OUTINE<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31" id="cite_ref-31">[31]</a></sup> </p>
</center><p>Citizen Outine is invited to publish in the journal L'Égalité a succinct report, from the Russian papers, of the Netschayeff trial. Before publication, his report will be submitted to the General Council.</p><center>
<p><b>XV.</b></p>
<p>CONVOCATION OF NEXT CONGRESS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32" id="cite_ref-32">[32]</a></sup> </p>
</center><p>The Conference leaves it to the discretion of the General Council to fix, according to events, the day and place of meeting of the next Congress or Conference.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33" id="cite_ref-33">[33]</a></sup> </p><center>
<p><b>XVI.</b></p>
<p>ALLIANCE DE LA DÉMOCRATIE SOCIALISTE.</p>
<p>(THE ALLIANCE OF SOCIALIST DEMOCRACY)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34" id="cite_ref-34">[34]</a></sup> </p>
</center><p>Considering that the "Alliance de la Démocratie socialiste" has declared itself dissolved (see letter to the General Council d.d. Geneva, 10th August 1871 signed by citizen N. Joukowsky, secretary to the "Alliance"),</p>
<p>That in its sitting of the 18th September (see No. II of this circular) the Conference has decided that all existing organisations of the International shall, in conformity with the letter and the spirit of the general rules, henceforth designate and constitute themselves simply and exclusively as branches, sections, federations, etc., of the International Working Men's Association with the names of their respective localities attached;</p>
<p>That the existing branches and societies shall therefore no longer be allowed to designate themselves by sectarian names such as Positivists, Mutualists, Collectivists, Communists, etc., or to form separatist bodies under the names of sections of propaganda, Alliance de la Démocratie socialiste, etc., pretending to accomplish special missions distinct from the common purposes of the Association<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35" id="cite_ref-35">[35]</a></sup> ;</p>
<p>That henceforth the General Council of the International Working Men's Association will in this sense have to interpret and apply article 5 of the administrative resolutions of the Basel Congress<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36" id="cite_ref-36">[36]</a></sup> : "The General Council has the right either to accept or to refuse the affiliation of any new section or group," etc.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37" id="cite_ref-37">[37]</a></sup> ;</p>
<p>
The Conference declares the question of the "Alliance de la Démocratie socialiste" to be settled.</p><center>
<p><b>XVII.</b></p>
<p>SPLIT IN THE FRENCH-SPEAKING PART</p>
<p>OF SWITZERLAND<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38" id="cite_ref-38">[38]</a></sup> </p>
</center><p>1.—The different exceptions taken by the Federal Committee of the Mountain sections as to the competency of the Conference are declared inadmissible. (This is but a resume of article 1 which will be printed in full in the Egalité of Geneva.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39" id="cite_ref-39">[39]</a></sup> )</p>
<p>2.—The Conference confirms the decision of the General Council of June 29th, 1870.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40" id="cite_ref-40">[40]</a></sup> </p>
<p>At the same time, in view of the persecutions which the International is at present undergoing, the Conference appeals to the feelings of fraternity and union which more than ever ought to animate the working class;</p>
<p>It invites the brave working men of the Mountain sections to rejoin the sections of the Romance Federation;</p>
<p>In case such an amalgamation should prove impracticable it decides that the dissident Mountain sections shall henceforth name themselves the "Jurassian Federation".</p>
<p>
The Conference gives warning that henceforth the General Council will be bound to publicly denounce and disavow all organs<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41" id="cite_ref-41">[41]</a></sup> of the International which, following the precedents of the Progrès and the Solidarité, should discuss in their columns, before the middle-class public, questions exclusively reserved for the local or Federal Committees and the General Council, or for the private and administrative sittings of the Federal or General Congresses. </p><center>

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The resolutions of the London Conference were mainly drafted and moved at its sessions by Marx and Engels. Several resolutions were based on preliminary drafts prepared by them (see this volume, pp. 407-08), Marx's speeches at the Sub-Committee meeting on September 9, 1871 (ibid., p p. 565-66) and also the speeches by Marx and Engels at the Conference. Marx's and Engels' positions were also reflected in resolutions moved by other delegates at the Conference. In his capacity as Conference Secretary for editing and translating resolutions, Engels took a major part in drafting and editing them.

Marx and Engels deemed it necessary to inform the members of the International and the international working-class movement in general about the major decisions of the Conference as quickly as possible. On their initiative, the Conference commissioned the delegates to make reports in the sections of the International about the adopted resolutions. The General Council charged a special commission headed by Marx with the official publication of the resolutions of the London Conference in English, French and German. Marx and Engels carried out the final editing of the Conference resolutions, which they received in rough form. The translation of the resolutions into French and German was done under their direct supervision.

In view of the fact that the decisions of the 1871 London Conference, which was of a consultative nature, were not, according to the Rules, obligatory, in contrast to the decisions of regular congresses, its resolutions approved by the General Council and published as a circular letter of the General Council, were addressed to all the federations and sections of the International. 

The resolutions were published in pamphlet form in English and French at the beginning of November 1871.

The resolutions were published in German in Der Volksstaat, No. 92, November 15, 1871 and as a separate edition early in February 1872. In November-December 1871, on the basis of these three editions approved by the General Council, many newspapers reprinted these resolutions in full or in an abridged form. They were translated into Italian, Spanish, Polish, SerboCroatian and Flemish and widely circulated.

The resolutions were published in the principal organs of the International in 1871: L'Egalite,No. 22, November 19, L'Internationale,No. 150, November 26, Die Tagwacht, Nos. 48, 49 and 50, November 25, December 2 and 9, Der Vorbote, No. 12, December, La Emancipation, No. 24, November 27, La Federacion, No. 119, November 26, L'Egnaglianza, No. 21, December 3, and others.

The decisions were supported by most of the sections and federations of the International.</span>

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Resolution I—"Composition of General Council"—was moved by Laurent Verrycken and César De Paepe, and was adopted at the eighth session of the London Conference on September 22, after a discussion in which Marx and Engels took part; of the four resolutions on the composition of the General Council passed by the Conference, only the first (Resolution I) and the fourth (see Point 1 of the section XIII "Special Votes of the Conference") were published. The second and third resolutions envisaged an extension of the probation period for candidate members of the Council to three weeks, and the right of sections of different countries to nominate candidates for the respective corresponding secretaryships. These resolutions have survived in the minutes of the London Conference and in the Minute Book of the General Council (meeting of October 16, 1871, at which Marx read the four resolutions).</span>

Point 1 of this resolution had already been formulated by Marx and Engels in the preliminary draft resolutions, which were submitted to and approved by the Sub-Committee of the General Council on September 9, 1871 (see this volume, pp. 407-08). This point, with some amendments, was included in the Administrative Regulations as Point 1 of Section II, points 2-4 became points 2-4 of Section V (see present edition, Vol. 23). The resolution was directed against the attempts of the petty-bourgeois elements (Right-wing Proudhonists, Bakuninists, Positivists, etc.) to impose their sectarian views on the local organisations of the International in opposition to the principles of the General Rules, which was reflected in the designations of local sections.</span>

During the preparations for the Conference, Marx raised the question of the contributions at the meeting of the Sub-Committee of the General Council on September 9, 1871 (see this volume, p. 565). The resolution, with slight amendments, was included in the Administrative Regulations as Section III (see present edition, Vol. 23).</span>

During the preparations for the Conference, the question was raised at the meeting of the Sub-Committee of the General Council on September 11, 1871 (see this volume, p. 567). Moving his motion, Marx stressed the need to establish women's branches in countries with a high rate of female employment in industry. The resolution was included in the Administrative Regulations as point 6 of Section V (see present edition, Vol. 23).</span>

Moving the resolution, Marx stressed that general statistics were especially important in organising aid for strikers from the workers of other countries and for other joint actions as an expression of international proletarian solidarity. The resolution was included in the Administrative Regulations as points 1-4 of Section VI (see present edition, Vol. 23).</span>

The resolution passed by the Geneva Congress (its text is included in section VI of the Administrative Regulations, see present edition, Vol. 23), was based on Section 2 (c) of Marx's "Instructions for the Delegates of the Provisional Central Council" (see present edition, Vol. 20).</span>

Delahaye's proposal contained anarcho-syndicalist ideas that specifically denied the significance of the proletarian party.lt was criticised by Marx and other delegates (see Note 406).

During the discussion of Vaillant's resolution and Serraillier's and Frankel's additions to it, Marx and Engels made speeches on the political action of the working class (see this volume, pp. 409-10, 413-14 and Note 259). Their speeches formed the basis of Resolution (IX) "Political Action of the Working Class" which the General Council was charged with drafting by the Conference. On October 7, 1871 a commission was set up; Engels was elected to the commission and Marx also took part in its work. Marx and Engels drafted an essentially new resolution formulating a clear proposition on the political party of the working class as indispensable for the victory of a socialist revolution and the achievement of its final goal—the building of a classless society.

The 9th resolution of the London Conference was approved by the Hague Congress in September 1872 and its main part was included in Article 7 a of the General Rules.</span>

The resolutions were based on propositions expounded at this session by Marx. Of the resolutions on this issue adopted by the Conference only the first two were published, which are given in this volume. The third resolution made the Belgian and Spanish federal councils and the Federal Council of Romance Switzerland ensure contacts between the French sections and the General Council and admit sections formed by French refugees to the respective federations. The fourth resolution proposed that the General Council publish an appeal to the French workers, calling on them to wage an open struggle against the counter-revolutionary government and, despite persecutions, to set up organisations of the International. At its meeting on October 24, however, the General Council resolved to abstain from publishing this appeal since it might do harm to the imprisoned Communards.</span>

Moving his motion, Marx noted that the General Council had previously opposed the formation of the Federal Committee or Council for England, because the English workers were represented on the General Council, which promoted their education in a spirit of proletarian internationalism and socialism and prevented the bourgeoisie from taking over the leadership of the English working-class movement. The tremendous amount of work carried out by the General Council after the establishment of the Paris Commune made, however, the formation of a Federal Council in England imperative. On October 21, 18717 a provisional London Federal Council, which included representatives of the London Section of the International and some trades unions, was set up.</span>

The first resolution was moved by De Paepe and adopted at the eighth session of the London Conference on September 22. The second, adopted at the ninth session on September 22, was based on Marx's speech on the position of the International in Germany and England, in which he noted the solidarity of the German workers with the Paris Commune, and also on a proposal introduced by Utin. The third one was adopted at the fifth session on September 20, in connection with the memorandum of the Spanish Federation on the organisation of the International in Spain. The fourth was moved by De Paepe at the ninth session, on September 22, in connection with Utin's report on Nechayev's case. Marx, who spoke on the issue, noted that the bourgeois press used the Nechayev conspiracy to slander the International (see Note 279).</span>

<li id="cite_note-29"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-29">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The reference is to the activities of Nechayev, who had established contacts with Bakunin and started setting up a secret organisation called Narodnaya Rasprava (People's Justice) in various cities in Russia. Having received from Bakunin the credentials of the non-existent European Revolutionary Union, Nechayev passed himself off as a representative of the International and thus misled the members of the organisation he had created.

When members of Nechayev's organisation were arrested and put on trial in St. Petersburg in the summer of 1871, his adventurist methods to achieve his own ends were made public: blackmail, intimidation, deception, etc. The bourgeois press used Nechayev's case to discredit the International.

Using the material of the St. Petersburg trial, Utin wrote a detailed report in French; its main points he used in his speech at the Hague Congress in 1872.

ENGELS TO THOMAS JAMES KNOWLES 2 2</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London,] 20 April 1883</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>If we do find the ms. in question I shall be glad and give you the re- fusal of it, on two self-understood conditions but which I may as well mention 1) that in case of refusal you do not communicate it to any- body else, and 2) that in case you print it, it appears as a separate ar- ticle out of all connection with any other.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p>Allow me to say that I am no 'Dr' but a retired cotton- spinner. 23

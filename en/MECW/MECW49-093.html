ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY</p>
<p>IN STUTTGART</p>
<p>London, 2 April 1891</p>
<p>Dear Kautsky,</p>
<p>In great haste on the most urgent matters. At last a letter from Bebel, quite amiable, though with sundry reservations, but the tone is as warm as ever and he expresses the wish to let bygones be bygones.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>I have written Meissner a most peremptory letter about the 4th edition<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and again asked him to send it to you. Also about the clean proofs for you of my concoction on Brentano<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> —if I don't get them<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> soon I shall send you—<i>enfin,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> I'd better do it straight away—I shall send you the master proof corrected by me so that you'll at least be able to see what the thing is like in the raw.</p>
<p>No doubt you will have got the introduction to the <i>Civil War;</i> it went off a few days ago. Perhaps you would be so good as to write the introductory note.</p>
<p>Everything has been straightened out with Lafargue. I pointed out to him that his arguments from Ricardo and A. Smith had been anticipated long before in the <i>Critique</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> and my preface to the 2nd volume,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> whereupon he seems to have promptly calmed down.</p>
<p>Schorlemmer is here and sends you his best wishes. It's now time for our meal and Aveling is coming—he is a grass widower, as Tussy is in Norwich drumming up support—so <i>adieu.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F.E.

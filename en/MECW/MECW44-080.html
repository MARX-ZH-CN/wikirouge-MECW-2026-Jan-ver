ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT</p>
<p>IN LEIPZIG</p>
<p>London, 20 April 1871<br>
122 Regent's Park Road, N.W.</p>
<p>Dear Liebknecht,</p>
<p>I must tell you today in all haste about the so-called INTERNATIONAL <i>DEMOCRATIC</i> ASSOCIATION,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> which you may well never have heard of and which, therefore, might be confused with us.</p>
<p>The association is a caricature of the IWMA. It has vegetated in obscurity here for a number of years, but expresses its desire, from time to time, to present itself to a wider public, i.e. to make itself ridiculous, exhibiting at the same time a certain secondary tendency to let itself quietly be mistaken for the IWMA. Since these people again held a meeting on the Paris Commune in Hyde Park last Sunday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> —a meeting which under <i>their</i> auspices was inevitably <i>doomed</i> to failure (they even let it be known that we had sent delegates, even though, when they sent a deputation to us, we roundly refused to do so)—and since they now also intend to establish branches on the Continent and will presumably send deputations to you as well, it has become necessary to make you acquainted with them. In the first place, there is <i>Weber,</i> that old trouble-maker from the Palatinate, whom you know; and secondly, Le Lubez, whom you have also come across. I enclose a cutting in which they present their muddled programme to the world in muddled language. Insofar as it is comprehensible, it is <i>purely bourgeois;</i> what they have to say on the subject of providing work and, alternatively, of making provision for those unable to work, is already fulfilled by the English Poor Law.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> They take good care not to say a word about capital and labour. The NATIONALISATION OF LAND is so universally accepted here that they cannot evade it, and in itself is so little in conflict with bourgeois interests that only the day before yesterday a <i>Tory</i> who has his million thalers in safe keeping told me that he was in favour of it. Weber is also, as you know, a supporter of Heinzen and a pure 'democrat'.</p>
<p>As long as these fellows pursued their activities in obscurity here, we left them to themselves, but if they choose to expand, conflicts will be unavoidable and we shall then have to hit them where it hurts.</p>
<p>So the <i>Volksstaat</i> was confiscated again yesterday for <i>lèse majesté,</i> as we hear on the telegraph.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> I am astonished that it did not happen earlier. You are extremely impudent. But 'after all, this is only right and proper', as Frederick II used to say.</p>
<p>The Vogt story<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> should be kept alive for a while. It is evident from the context that <i>Karl</i> Vogt is the only Vogt who can be meant. In the first place, no other Vogt is so well known as to be referred to as Vogt, <i>tout court,</i> without first name and address. In the second place, what other Vogt performed such valuable services at that time for the Bonaparte family that he should have been given 40,000 frs in August, i.e. immediately after the conclusion of the Italian campaign? Moreover, the formula, <b>il lui a été remis en Août 1859',</b><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> indicates that he had received other remittances. The more frequently you return to the point, the more the bourgeois press, which suppresses all this, will find itself forced to take note of it. You might also bring it to the attention of the <i>Proletarier</i> and the <i>Volkswille.</i> Since experience has taught me that Stieber's agents are as clumsy at opening letters as they are at fabricating conspiracies, I hereby inform you once and for all that <i>all</i> my letters to you are securely sealed with my seal and the initials F. E. in Gothic script. The Prussians cannot yet in all decency break open sealing-wax on rubber, and certainly not so that it cannot be noticed. Mostly they just tear open the side of the envelope with their oafish fists. So if my seal is not clear and legible you will know what has happened. It will at any rate infuriate the fellows to have to let a letter addressed to you and with F. E. on the seal pass through their hands unbroken.</p>
<p>It is time for the post and I still have all sorts of things to tell you, but I must end now.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

In April 1871 members of the Association founded the Universal Republican League. Its leaders invited the General Council of the International to join, but their proposal was rejected unanimously at the General Council meeting on 25 April 1871. With his letter Engels enclosed a newspaper clipping with the League's programme.</span>

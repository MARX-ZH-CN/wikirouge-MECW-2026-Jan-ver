MARX TO ENGELS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 11 December 1876</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>Kovalevsky came to see me yesterday, asked for the Hanssen<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> ; told him he should have it <i>tomorrow evening;</i> at the same time agreed that he and I should call on you that same evening (Tuesday).</p>
<p>I am sending you the Hanssen which, as I did, you will polish off with ease in a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Written about book-binding.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>After the <i>conference</i> (St. James)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Mr Gladstone entered the gallery where Madame Novikov was sitting, offered her his arm—<i>pour montrer<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </i> (or so he said according to Novikov's account) <i>que l'alliance entre l'Angleterre et la Russie existe déjà</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> —and, with her on his arm, strutted through the vast throng which made way on both sides; he a relatively small, skinny chap, she a veritable dragoon. She remarked to Kovalevsky: <i>que ces Anglais sont gauches!</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Generalissimus Chernyayev had twice asked Novikov by telegraph whether he should also appear at the conference; she had to tell him that Mr Gladstone would be pleased to see him personally but thought a public appearance inexpedient.</p>
<p>At the conference (admission by TICKET) Harrison (who, in his article 'Cross and Crescent' in the <i>Fortnightly,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> makes great play with a few HINTS recently picked up from Kovalevsky) told Howell to his face that all the workers present without exception belonged to a paid band well known to him (Harrison).</p>
<p>Unfortunately Charles Darwin also lent his name to the rotten demonstration; Lewes refused to do so.

It ended in Russia's defeat and the signing of the Paris Peace Treaty in 1856. In acoordance with this treaty, Russia renounced its claims to the 'protection' of the Christian subjects of the Turkish Empire, agreed to the neutralisation of the Black Sea and was forbidden to have military bases and warships there, and recognised the collective protectorate of the great powers over Serbia, Moldavia and Wallachia, which remained under the Sultan's sovereignty. Russia also pledged not to erect fortifications on the Aland Islands.</span>

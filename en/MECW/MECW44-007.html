MARX TO ENGELS
<br>IN MANCHESTER
<br>[London,] 29 July 1870
<br>Dear FRED,
<br>You will see from the enclosed that so FAR the <i>Pall Mall</i> business is quite satisfactory and your first article<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> will appear this evening. T h e only reason for displeasure is that MR Greenwood (to whom I have <i>not</i> yet mentioned your name, BY THE BY) has made no reference to the <i>TERMS</i> even though IN MY FIRST LETTER TO HIM I made a specific inquiry about them. 1 7 O n the other hand, Thieblin (i.e. Taran) said to me on his departure for the Continent and at his LEAVETAKING from me that payment was made as a matter of course at the e n d of each month.
<br>At all events it seems to me wisest TO GO ON for a few more articles so that we have a firm case before issuing an OFFICIAL NOTE on this <i>punctum</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>I went to see Smith 24 yesterday. I learned there that no one in London made inquiries about you in Manchester, because your LANDLORD also has a SEAT near Manchester and desired to make his own inquiry there. However, it would be better to write to him and speed the matter up. At all events I understand that no 'third party' has intervened.
<br><i>Salut.</i>
<br>Your
<br>K. M.

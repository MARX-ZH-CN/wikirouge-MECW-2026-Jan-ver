<p><i>To Marx in London</i></p>
<p><b>Manchester, 3 March 1865</b></p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>You must excuse me for neglecting my correspondence this week. Borkheim was here and took up a lot of my time; he left this evening; then there is <b>cotton-panic</b> following Sherman's advance with endless letter-writing and vain attempts to dispose of our <b>stock</b>. I think Richmond will be abandoned within a fortnight, and, unless by some miracle Lee manages to get a fresh respite of 2-3 months, the final, decisive battle will be fought within 4 weeks.</p>
<p>I must go home now and write to Meissner and Siebel, who is putting himself to a lot of trouble — he says he has sent you the statement. I am glad the thing is finally published; <i>still nothing</i> in the damned <i>Social-Demokrat</i> of 1 March — presumably, they tried to go back on it? It's a load off my mind that we have at last made the break with that gang. So, now we have the grand concluding article on Bismarck which was supposed to patch everything up. <i>O, jerum, jerum, jerum!</i></p>
<p>Your<br>F. E.</p>
<p>I have in my hurry not managed to find any decent port, but sent claret yesterday. Will keep looking for some port.

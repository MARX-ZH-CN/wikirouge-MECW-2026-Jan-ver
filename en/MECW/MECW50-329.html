LAURA LAFARGUE TO ISAAK HOURWICH</p>
<p>IN CHICAGO</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>Eastbourne, 2 July 1895<br>
Mr. I. A. Hourwich. Chicago</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>In reply to your letter dated May 18, 634 addressed to Mr. Frederick Engels, I beg to inform you that Mr. Engels has been out of health and is still at the present moment abstaining from literary work. I am commissioned by Frederick Engels to say that he does not consider himself authorised to hand over for publication to third partner any MSS. or fragments of MSS. left by my father, Karl Marx. I am, Sir,</p>
<p>Yours truly</p>
<p>Laura Lafargue
</p>

<p><br>
Mr. <em>Eccarius</em> in the chair.</p>
<p>The minutes of the previous meeting on the motion of Mr. <em>Fox,</em> seconded by Mr. <em>Holtorp,</em> were confirmed.</p>
<p>The <em>Secretary</em> [Cremer] read a letter from Professor Beesly respectfully declining to serve on the Committee, also from M. Talandier thanking the Committee for electing him a member and wishing to know if he could remain a member without taking part in or attending the meetings, as the distance he lived from London would prevent him doing so.</p>
<p>A letter was also read from M.Bocquet asking the same question.</p>
<p>The following were then elected on the Central Council:</p>
<p>Mr. George Lochner proposed by <em>Marx,</em> seconded by <em>Carter;</em></p>
<p>Mr. William Kaub proposed by <em>Marx,</em> seconded by <em>Carter;</em></p>
<p>Mr. Bolleter proposed by <em>Holtorp,</em> seconded by <em>Fontana;</em></p>

<p>Dr. <em>Marx</em> called attention to the reports in the <em>Morning Star</em> and <em>Bee-Hive</em> of the last meeting and complained that in such reports one of the fundamental principles of the Association, viz., truth, had been violated; he also complained of the Address having been published without the sanction of the Committee.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The <em>Secretary</em> explained that he had nothing to do with the reports, at which he was very much surprised; he believed Mr. Hartwell had supplied the reports in question.</p>
<p>To obviate the recurrence of such erroneous reports Dr. <em>Marx</em> proposed, Mr. <em>Fontana</em> seconded:</p>
<p>That the Secretary purchase a manifold writer and for the future all reports for the press be sent through the Secretary.</p>
<p>Mr. <em>Aldovrandi</em> proposed and Mr. <em>Carter</em> seconded:</p>
<p>That Dr. Marx be requested to correct the typographical errors in the Address and that 500 copies of the Address, Programme<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> and Rules be printed. Carried unanimously.</p>

<p><br>
Mr. <em>Eccarius</em> in the chair.</p>
<p>The minutes of the former meeting having been read, were confirmed on the motion of Mr. <em>Weston,</em> seconded <em>by Whitlock.</em></p>
<p>The <em>Secretary</em> [Cremer] read letters from several members apologising for their non-attendance.</p>
<p>A long discussion took place regarding absent members of the Council who reside too far away to allow them to attend its meetings.</p>
<p>A resolution proposed by Mr. <em>Whitlock,</em> seconded by Mr. <em>Dick,</em> to elect them corresponding members of the Committee was ultimately withdrawn with the understanding that as the present Committee was merely provisional in its character that all who had been elected on it should remain, but that no new member should be elected who resided at such a distance as to preclude him from attending the meetings.</p>
<p>Mr. <em>Cremer</em> then proposed, M. <em>Le Lubez</em> seconded:</p>
<p>That 1,000 [copies of the] Address and Rules be printed. Carried unanimously.</p>
<p>Mr. <em>Dick</em> proposed that the design for the cards be referred to the Sub-Committee and that 1,000 be printed.</p>
<p>A long discussion then took place with regard to the terms on which organised bodies should be received into the Association, and ultimately on the motion of Dr. <em>Marx,</em> seconded by Mr. <em>Blackmore,</em> the question was adjourned to the next meeting.</p>
<p>Mr. <em>Cremer</em> then brought forward a plan to provide a home for the Association which was agreed to be referred to the Sub-Committee.</p>
<p>The <em>Secretary</em> then stated that as he had only accepted office till the Rules had been framed and adopted, and such having been done, he now tendered his resignation.</p>
<p>The meeting having refused to accept the resignation, Mr. <em>Blackmore</em> proposed, Mr. <em>Whitlock</em> seconded:</p>
<p>That Mr. Cremer be requested still to continue office till after the assembling of the congress. Carried unanimously.</p>
<p>Mr. <em>Cremer</em> would have preferred that the meeting had elected another but he would accept it on the condition, viz., that it was to be an honorary position.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Mr. <em>Weston</em> proposed, Mr. <em>Longmaid</em> seconded, a vote of thanks to the <em>Bee-Hive</em> for the insertion of the Address, Rules, etc.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> Carried unanimously.</p>

<p>Dr. <em>Marx</em> then brought up the report of the Sub-Committee, also a draft of the address which had been drawn up for presentation to the people of America congratulating them on their having re-elected Abraham Lincoln as President. The address is as follows and was unanimously agreed to: [Here a clipping from The Bee-Hive Newspaper, No. 169, January 7, 1865, carrying the text of the address, is pasted into the Minute Book]
</p>
<blockquote><p>"TO ABRAHAM LINCOLN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"Sir, — We congratulate the American people upon your re-election by a large majority. If resistance to the Slave Power was the reserved watchword of your first election, the triumphant war-cry of your re-election is Death to Slavery.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"From the commencement of the Titanic-American strife the working men of Europe felt instinctively that the star-spangled banner carried the destiny of their class. The contest for the territories which opened the dire epopee, was it not to decide whether the virgin soil of immense tracts should be wedded to the labour of the emigrant or prostituted by the tramp of the slavedriver?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"When an oligarchy of 300,000 slave-holders dared to inscribe for the first time in the annals of the world 'slavery' on the banner of Armed Revolt when on the very spots where hardly a century ago the idea of one great Democratic Republic had first sprung up, whence the first Declaration of the Rights of Man was issued, and the first impulse given to the European revolution of the eighteenth century; when on those very spots counter-revolution, with systematic thoroughness, gloried in rescinding 'the ideas entertained at the time of the formation of the old constitution', and maintained 'slavery to be a beneficent institution', indeed, the old solution of the great problem of 'the relation of capital to labour', and cynically proclaimed property in man 'the corner-stone of the new edifice', then the working classes of Europe understood at once, even before the fanatic partisanship of the upper classes for the Confederate gentry had given its dismal warning, that the slave-holders' rebellion was to sound the tocsin for a general holy crusade of property against labour, and that for the men of labour, with their hopes for the future, even their past conquests were at stake in that tremendous conflict on the other side of the Atlantic. Everywhere they bore therefore patiently the hardships imposed upon them by the cotton crisis, opposed enthusiastically the pro-slavery intervention — importunities of their betters — and, from most parts of Europe, contributed their quota of blood to the good cause.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"While the working men, the true political powers of the North, allowed slavery to defile their own republic, while before the Negro, mastered and sold without his concurrence, they boasted it the highest prerogative of the white-skinned labourer to sell himself and choose his own master, they were unable to attain the true freedom of labour, or to support their European brethren in their struggle for emancipation; but this barrier to progress has been swept off by the red sea of civil war.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"The working men of Europe feel sure that, as the American War of Independence initiated a new era of ascendancy for the middle class, so the American Anti-Slavery War will do for the working classes. They consider it an earnest of the epoch to come that it fell to the lot of Abraham Lincoln, the single-minded son of the working class, to lead his country through the matchless struggle for the rescue of an enchained race and the reconstruction of a social world.</p></blockquote>
<p>"Signed, on behalf of the International Working Men's Association, the Central Council:</p>

<p>The newspaper clipping ends here. Further, on p. 16 of the Minute Book, the minutes are in Cremer's hand</p>
<p>A long discussion then took place as to the mode of presenting the address and the propriety of having a M.P.</p>
<p>with the deputation; this was strongly opposed by many members who said working men should rely on themselves and not seek for extraneous aid.</p>
<p>The Secretary stated he had corresponded with the American Minister and he, the Secretary, had no doubt that if Mr. Adams was asked that he would appoint a time to receive the deputation.</p>
<p>It was then proposed by Whitlock, seconded by Eccarius, and carried unanimously:</p>
<p>That the Secretary correspond with the United States Minister asking him to appoint a time for receiving the deputation, such deputation to consist of the members of the Central Council.</p>
<p>Further, on pp. 16-17 of the Minute Book, the minutes are in an unknown hand.</p>
<p>Mr. Wheeler proposed, Le Lubez seconded:</p>
<p>That the names of all those who are present be appended to the address, also those who are absent and are willing to endorse the views set forth in the address.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Question of members' cards. Mr. Lubez proposed, Mr. Lama seconded:</p>
<p>That 1,000 cards be printed and that 1d. each be charged for them. Carried unanimously.</p>
<p>Mr. <em>Fox</em> then brought forward the following resolution which was seconded by Mr. Wheeler, spoken to by Mr., Holtorp,21 and unanimously adopted:</p>
<p>Resolved that the Polish war of independence was made in the general interests of the peoples of Europe; that in</p>
<p>its defeat the cause of civilisation and human progress suffered a severe shock; 2nd, that Poland has an unimpeachable claim upon the leading nations of Europe to contribute by every necessary means towards the restoration of her national sovereignty.</p>
<p>Mr. <em>Fox</em> also proposed that an address from the British section of the Central Council be drawn up and presented to the Polish people. It was referred to the Sub-Committee to prepare such address.</p>
<p>The meeting then adjourned till December 13th.</p>

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">An analysis of the General Council minutes for October 1864 and of Marx's letter to Engels of November 4, 1864, makes it possible to retrace how Marx drew up the International's programme documents. On October 8, at the first Sub-Committee meeting, Weston submitted his draft of a declaration of principles (see Notes 8 and 10) and Wolff — the Rules of the Italian working men's associations, which he had translated into English (see Note g). On October 11, the General Council, after considering these two documents, referred them back to the Sub-Committee to be revised. At the Sub-Committee meeting of October 15, Le Lubez read the version he had drawn up on the basis of Weston's and Wolff's drafts. This version, which was discussed by the General Council at its meeting of October 18, consisted of a preamble, claiming to be a declaration of principles, and rules.<br>It was only at this meeting that Marx first had the opportunity to familiarise himself with the said documents, his opinion of which he expressed in his letter to Engels of November 4, 1864. Following a discussion, the declaration of principles and the rules were approved in the main by the General Council. Marx, however, managed to have them referred back to the Sub-Committee for final editing. On October 20 the Sub-Committee met at Marx's house; at that meeting they managed to edit only the first point of the rules. The next meeting of the Sub-Committee was to be held on October 27. This gave Marx the needed time to revise completely the documents in question. He wrote the Inaugural Address of the Working Men's International Association, which was not in the original drafts; he altered the whole preamble, throwing out the declaration of principles written by Le Lubez, and reduced the 40 points of the rules to 10, changing the very principle of organisation and only retaining some points of a purely formal character (the name of the organisation, the decision to hold a congress in Brussels in 1865. help to members of the organisation when changing their places of residence, etc.).<br>On October 27 the Sub-Committee approved the Address and the Rules as drawn up by Marx.</span>

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">On November 2, the Liberal London daily The Morning Star, No. 2703, and on November 5, the trade-union weekly The Bee-Hive, No. 160, published a report of the General Council meeting of November 1, 1864, carrying inaccurate information. In particular, they reported that the General Council had passed a resolution to convene a congress of the International Working Men's Association in Brussels in 1865, although no such resolution had been adopted; the compiler of the report had simply taken this information from Point 3 of the Provisional Rules. Furthermore, the same issue of <em>The Bee-Hive</em> had published the Inaugural Address without the knowledge of the General Council.<br><em>The Bee-Hive</em> was published in London from 1861 to 1876 under the titles: <em>The Bee-Hive</em>, <em>The Bee-Hive</em> Newspaper, The Penny Bee-Hive; the paper was under the strong influence of bourgeois radicals and reformists. On November 22, 1864, the General Council decided to make <em>The Bee-Hive</em> the organ of the Association. The paper published the official documents of the International Working Men's Association and the reports of the Council meetings. On repeated occasions, however, Marx had been obliged to protest against the distorted or abridged version in which it printed the International's documents. In 1869 <em>The Bee-Hive</em> became, in effect, a bourgeois organ. On April 26, 1870, the General Council, on Marx's suggestion, decided to sever their connection with it.</span>

MARX TO ENGELS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>London, 15 October 1868</p>
<p>Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow the Lafargue FAMILY is leaving for Paris. This will greatly reduce our HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES.</p>
<p>I have written to A. Frank et Co. in Paris. Since I know that he has sold COPIES OF MY <i>Anti-Proudhon</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> as recently as <i>in the past few weeks,</i> I asked in my letter for accounts of the whole affair, REMINDING MR Frank that he and Vogler were only my <i>agents de vente</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> and that I had paid all the printing costs. Thereupon I received, a few days ago, the following reply:</p>
<p>'J'ai l'honneur, Monsieur, de vous informer que j'ai racheté la Maison A. Frank le 21 Oct. 1865, <i>sans</i> actifs et passifs.— Il y avait à cette époque 92 exemplaires de votre brochure <i>Misère de la philosophie</i> en magasin que je tiens à votre disposition.— Quant à ce qui pourrait vous revenir de solde, il faudra vous adresser soit à.M r Vogler soit au curateur de la succession de mon prédécesseur, M r Bassot, 58 rue de Bondy, Paris, etc. per <i>F. Vieweg,</i> propriétaire actuel de la maison A. Frank.'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>I shall now grant Lafargue power of attorney to collect the 92 <i>exemplaires,</i> which he will sell amongst his friends. For the remainder (there were 1,500 <i>exemplaires),</i> I am granting Schily power of attorney to start legal proceedings. I do not know Vogler's whereabouts, but his former <i>associé</i> Shee still has a <i>librairie</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> in Brussels, where I can mobilise a handful of young lawyers belonging to our Association. It would be nice if I could still squeeze out some cash.</p>
<p>Attached packet of the <i>Social-Demokrat,</i> upon which you should please write me a few marginal notes (regarding the TRADES UNIONS stories) since I did not have the time to read the stuff. The letter to Schweitzer has gone off.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> Enclosed also the latest number of <i>Lanterne</i> and a pamphlet about Plon-Plon, said to be written by Charras.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Apropos. I had a meeting with Beesly. The SUB-EDITOR of Morley (the EDITOR for the SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT) declared that the argument was irrefutable. However, the article was too 'DRY' for A MAGAZINE. Beesly asked me to put it in a more popular form, without sacrificing the SCIENTIFIC POINTS. This is RATHER DIFFICULT. However, I'll try. In particular, he wants a longer introduction, including personalia about MY PAST and the book's impact in Germany. This, OF COURSE, you must write. But there is time for this until I send you the BULK of the article. The whole shit is then to go into <i>The Westminster Review. Salut</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>Have you read <i>A. Slade: 'Turkey and the Crimean War'?</i> It appears that 'Bosh' is a Turkish word, since Slade says: 'bosh lakerdeh' (empty words).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> </p>

Vieweg. The publication was undertaken on a commission basis: Marx paid part of the expenses as the author and was to receive a certain sum from the sale of each copy. By 1868, the demand for the book grew steeply owing to the mounting campaign against the Proudhonist elements in the International, while the book became a bibliographical rarity. In view of this, Marx applied, in October 1868, to the Paris publisher, who, as is clear from the letter, had stopped the sales altogether. Nothing is known about the results of Lafargue's negotiations on this issue.</span>

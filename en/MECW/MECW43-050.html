ENGELS TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN</p>
<p>IN HANOVER</p>
<p>York, 31 July 1868</p>
<p>Dear Kugelmann,</p>
<p>This scrawl must be excused by the fact that I am on my way for a few days to bring my dear spouse<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>to the seaside resort at Bridlington (I bet you couldn't guess how this name is pronounced), and by the haste in which I send you the enclosed composition.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>The business is splendid, that is, if it can be done and Kertbény is not bragging.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>The enclosed scribble has been composed, as far as possible, in the spirit of the rag,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>but it should possibly be made milder here and there. Marx thinks the title 'A German <i>Socialist"</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>would be better, which would be very nice, if Monsieur Kertbény did not object; but this must be prevented <i>above all,</i> so I find your suggestion, being the 'milder' one, is better.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Marx has, for the time being, kept your letter with him, and since it is already late today anyway, and everybody in the hotel is hurrying to bed, I shall have to answer it next week. I put Lupus' photogram aside for you some time ago; luckily it is still one of the old good prints; recently I had another 24 prints made, but in the meantime the negative had faded so much that they turned out very badly. As for me, a blood vessel burst in the conjunctiva of my left eye a fortnight ago, and left behind a red patch on the apple (south-west side) which has not yet vanished, and with which I would not like to be eternised. So you will just have to wait for a while.</p>
<p>N.B. There are two corrections, marked A and B, written here later; please insert them in the right place.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>It would be desirable for Kertbény neither to know the author of the article, nor see the original handwriting.</p>
<p>So until next week.</p>
<p>Yours</p>
<p>F. E.

In July 1869, Engels revised it for <i>Die Zukunft</i> newspaper, and it appeared in No. 185 under the heading 'Karl Marx' on 11 August 1869 (see present edition, Vol. 21).</span>

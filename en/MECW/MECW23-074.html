<br>122 Regent's Park Road. N.W.
<br>London, 16th October, 1872
<br>Citizens,
<br>I had the honour of submitting to you, by citizen Dupont, at your meeting of September 26, a communication addressed to me by the Lisbon Federal Council regarding some trade matters of International Sections there, which required immediate action here.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I have seen this communication published in <i><b>The International Herald</b></i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> but have not had any intimation that the Federal Council has taken any further steps in the matter.
<br>As I am bound to give an account to my Lisbon Correspondents of what I have done on behalf of the parties interested, I hope the Federal Council will be good enough to let me know whether anything, and what, has been done by the Council with regard to the subject in question.
<br>I remain Citizens fraternally yours,
<br><i><b>F. E.</b></i>

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The Portuguese Federal Council sent a letter to the British Federal Council c/o Engels, with the request to take urgent measures to prevent the importation of strike-breakers from Britain. The threat of importation arose because all the foundry workers of Lisbon went on strike on September 19, 1872. The strikers were joined by the workers of other trades and they demanded shorter working hours. The Portuguese Federation of the International supported the strike in Lisbon. Its letter was read out at the meeting of the British Federal Council on September 26 and published in The International Herald on October 5, 1872.</span>

ENGELS TO PYOTR LAVROV</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>London, 9 August 1871</p>
<p>My dear Sidorov,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Here are the prices of the English books:</p>
<p>Lecky, <i>History of the Spirit of Rationalism</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>—£-. 16/
Ditto, <i>Ditto of European Morals</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>1.8/-
Tylor, <i>Primitive Culture</i> 1.4/-
Lubbock, <i>Origin of Civilisation</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>-. 16/-
Maine, <i>Ancient Law</i> -. 12/-
Ditto, <i>Rural Communities</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>-. 9/-</p>
<p>These are bookseller's prices and there would be a discount of about 15 per cent on the above. However, if you authorise me to try and get them for you second-hand, I would probably have to pay no more than half the price and my little bookseller would gladly attend to the matter. I would have let you have this information sooner, but my bookseller has been away on his travels.</p>
<p>You will have received a letter from Williams<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>yesterday. We have not had more recent news from the indisposed traveller,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>but we have found the means of conveying a letter by safe hand to IleTep6yprb<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>and hope soon to have the more detailed news for which we have insistently been asking.</p>
<p>As to the <i>Tauchnitz</i> edition of Buckle,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>I know nothing about it but I should be very surprised if it does not exist—any German bookseller in Paris would, by the way, be able to tell you.</p>
<p>I am sending you the last two numbers of <i>The Eastern Post.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>We have had various new arrivals here, amongst others BaAbaH-b, Teöcb, AoHré,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup>probably Williams has written to you about that.</p>
<p>Could you arrange a subscription for me to the <i>Gazette des Tribuneaux</i> beginning on 7 August or even 1 August? We need the most authentic text of the Versailles trials<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup>for our historical studies and there is no other journal to my knowledge that would give as comprehensive a report. At the same time I don't know how to get hold of it over here, and there is no time to lose, for if we delay we might miss the most interesting numbers. You would greatly oblige us if you could see to this matter; we shall attend to your outlays afterwards.</p>
<p>Another thing. In order to make a study of military events during the two sieges of Paris,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup>I need a plan of Paris and its environs, the best that is to be had, giving if possible also the street names in Neuilly and the other minor localities where fighting took place. I have tried in vain to obtain one here. Perhaps you could give me the title of a detailed map and the publisher's name after which I should have no difficulty in procuring it.</p>
<p>So you see, my dear friend, that you cannot live in Paris with impunity and that I shall probably have more commissions for you than you will have for me. Meanwhile let me know what to do about the English books and rest assured of my cordial respects.</p>
<p>F. Engels

It included Marx, Vaillant, Verrycken, MacDonnel and Eccarius; Engels also took part in the commission's work. The meeting mentioned by Marx was held on 18 September 1871. Marx reported on the commission's findings at the sitting of 21 September 1871, which unanimously adopted the resolution tabled by him (see present edition, Vol. 22, pp. 419-22).
The question of Robin's expulsion from the General Council for his attempt to disrupt the work of the commission was considered at several Council meetings. On 17 October 1871 Robin was expelled.</span>

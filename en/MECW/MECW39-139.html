MARX TO ADOLF CLUSS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN WASHINGTON</p>
<p>[London,] 21 January 1853</p>
<p>... Yesterday I read a letter from Heinzen to Bamberger. He complains of money troubles and says he has been <i>forced</i> to resign from the <i>Janus</i>. As regards Dr Kellner, he was for a time correspondent of the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i>. You should see if you can't make contact with him <i>d'une manière ou d'une autre</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>Once Weydemeyer has put out feelers, your first step might be to send him a 'pithy' article... The wretched Willich, who is done for here, sailed for America last week as Kinkel's agent; so it is important that <i>at least</i> those parts of the pamphlet<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>which relate to him should appear in the press. It would be best if you could arrange for the pamphlet to be published in magazines; it has already come out in Switzerland, so it is no longer so important. Could not <i>Börnstein</i>, who wants to catch us with 'his bait', also be of some use in this matter? From what I know of him and his <i>compagnon</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>Bernays, they will be much tickled by the account of the trickery of the police. I think it <i>politic</i> to establish contact with these people. I can assure you that if Bernays finds the means—and we must provide him with it—to re-establish contact with us, I could have these two chaps eating out of my hand. Have you heard nothing more from <i>Schramm</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>or, on the other side, from <i>Teilering</i>?

MARX TO EDOUARD VAILLANT</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 22 October 1871</p>
<p>Dear Mr Vaillant,</p>
<p>As I am having my pamphlet<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>printed next Monday, please make your corrections as soon as possible.</p>
<p>As to the resolution on political action,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>the form initially produced by the Committee (Engels, [Martin],<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>Le Moussu) and the amendments subsequently adopted by vote of the General Council have created such an imbroglio that I have been compelled to alter the arrangement.</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

In the course of the discussion of this resolution and Serraillier's and Frankel's addenda to it Marx and Engels made speeches which provided the basis for the resolution 'Political Action of the Working Class' (IX). To draw up the resolution a special commission of the General Council was set up which included Engels, Martin and Le Moussu. The resolution was then discussed at the General Council's meeting of 16 October. Marx was asked to prepare it for the press.</span>

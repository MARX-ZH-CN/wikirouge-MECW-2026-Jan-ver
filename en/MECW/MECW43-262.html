MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 12 November 1869</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>This week something suspicious has displayed itself in my left arm-pit (as in Manchester<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> ), and on my leg. Arsenic again immediately. Additionally, Tussy forces me to take long walks with her after 1 or 2 o'clock every day. Finally, today introduced surreptitiously <i>for the first time</i> a flannel vest, since a cold in this state is not pleasant.</p>
<p>You are surprised by the pluck of the French, and speak SOMEWHAT SNEERINGLY of us upright Germans. What risks we take you will see from the enclosed extravaganza.</p>
<p>In Stuttgart, in accordance with his habit, Freiligrath once again had himself photographed in several dozen poses, decked out as a statue, etc. The most successful holy picture of this Classen-Kappelmann-hero<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> is—<i>verbotenus</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> —a scene in which he <i>as a lion</i> rides on a <i>camel.</i> This is probably a back-hander for Heine's camel who defeats the lion.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Liebknecht will be taking off next week for 3 months in prison, and has sent Borkheim a desperate plea for money.</p>
<p>What scares me about the French is the terrible confusion in their heads. Ledru-Rollin's circular letter is quite that of a pretender.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> He really appears to take <i>au sérieux</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> the dictatorship over France offered him by Heinzen. On the other hand, <i>Zukunft</i> has been good enough to offer Mr Acollas, whom nobody in Paris knows, a post in the provisional government, because he had called the French to accept Dr J. Jacoby's programme instead of the antiquated human and <i>citoyen</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> rights of 1793. One good turn deserves another. I find that OLD Jacoby himself is not playing properly the role he dictated for himself. Grasping the opportunity of the Hanoverian event,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> should he not call on the Prussian sergeant-major-government—since Prussia is, after all, a 'military state'—also to lay aside those useless and, at the same time, expensive decorations, such as chambers, civil courts and the like? Wrapping oneself up silently in the depths of one's own moral indignation does not lure a soul from his hearth.</p>
<p>A while ago, the Russian gentlemen bombarded an island near Korea just for amusement, as Borkheim discovered in a Moscow newspaper.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> Not a word about it in the English papers. If things go on like this, these fine fellows will soon be in possession of Japan.</p>
<p>The latest MEETINGS in Ireland were very nice; the clerics were seized by their collars and removed from the speaker's stand. Instead of the programme on Ireland,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> for which there is no proper motive, I have had (in order to adopt resolutions) the following placed on the agenda for next Tuesday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> </p>
<p>1. Proceedings of the English ministry on the Irish amnesty question!</p>
<p>2. The attitude of the English working class to the Irish question.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Marx ironically likens Freiligrath to the manufacturer Classen-Kappelmann, member of the Cologne city council, who became a notorious figure in 1865. In July 1865 he took part in the preparation of a banquet for the Party of Progress members who were deputies of the Chamber of Representatives of the Prussian Landtag in opposition to the Prussian Government. The banquet was banned and Classen-Kappelmann, who feared arrest, left for Belgium. The guests arrived to find the premises closed and assembled at the Zoo. The assembly was dispersed by the police.</span>

Describing it as that of a pretender, Marx alludes to the fact that in the Presidential elections in France on 10 December 1848, Ledru-Rollin nominated himself as a representative of petty-bourgeois democrats. His letter, dated 7 November 1869, was published in <i>Le Réveil</i> on 10 November under the heading 'Aux électeurs'.</span>

While working on the review, Engels wrote out excerpts from <i>Capital,</i> which later made up a synopsis (see Note 26). The review was written around 20 May-1 June 1868, but rejected by the editorial board (see present edition, Vol. 20).</span>

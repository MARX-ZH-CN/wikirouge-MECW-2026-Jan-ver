<p>ENGELS TO LOUISE FREYBERGER</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Eastbourne,] 1 July 1895</p>
<p>Dear Louise,</p>
<p>Will you also please bring me a small bottleful of the carbolic acid solution in my bedroom? My nose is again suffering from hallucinations.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>You would also be well-advised to rig yourself and the baby out for rather chilly weather. Yesterday it was certainly not above 12 or 13 degrees Centigrade here.</p>
<p>With regard to E. Aveling's article on the Independent Labour Party, which I left in your keeping on my departure, would you please forward it to him at Green Street, Green NEAR Chislehurst, Kent. Edward and Tussy left this morning. Laura, too, intends to take the day boat from Newhaven on Wednesday morning so as to be home that same evening. So you won't be seeing her again. She sends her love. This morning it was fine, then wet, and now it's sunny again. I slept very well last night, but on Saturday evening the powders didn't have much effect, whereas yesterday they acted all the more effectively—in consequence am somewhat muzzy today. Regards to Ludwig. Love and a kiss to the little one and to yourself from</p>
<p>Yours</p>
<p>F.E.

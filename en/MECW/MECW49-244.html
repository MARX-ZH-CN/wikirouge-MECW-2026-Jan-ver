ENGELS TO REGINA BERNSTEIN
<br>IN ZURICH
<br>London, 25 July 1892
<br>Dear Gine,
<br>We were delighted to get your and Ede's letter and showed it to Tussy yesterday. From the picture the château<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> has the appearance of a really splendid little castle; a garden restaurant for some 500 people and, next to a couple of giant poplars, a few mysterious trees that look like unassuming palms; on the slope below the vines whence comes the sour wine.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Still, one gets used to that too and in any case it's better than London ALE, while the air up there must be a lot better than in Highgate. I'm glad it's doing Ede good and that you can hope to bring him back with his nerves functioning in such a way that he is no longer conscious of them.
<br>Here too the summer holidays have started. Louise left for Cologne yesterday afternoon and by now — 5 p.m.— will doubtless be very close to Berlin. The day after tomorrow I set off for a fortnight's stay with Pumps,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> after which I shall pay another visit to the dear fatherland about the time you will be preparing to leave; indeed it is not impossible that I may venture as far as Zurich shortly after you have gone — that, however, is entirely between ourselves. But why did you buy those confounded return tickets? They are the main obstacle that prevents us from sauntering along the lake together. I'm glad to hear that your mama is still such a doughty mountaineer. If I really do get to Berlin — alas, the dream is far too beautiful for one to believe it might come true — I shall in any case see her there.
<br>Tell Ede that Louise was so overwhelmed on hearing that he had said <i>Massel</i> and <i>Broche</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> three times on her behalf that I had to administer a potent draught of cognac before she set off on her journey to help her recover from the shock.
<br>What follows next is for Ede. Namely, in the first place, Tussy's and Edward's article<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> was ready by Sunday (a week ago yesterday) and was sent off to Stuckert.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> <br>Secondly, our successes in the elections<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> have now been generally acknowledged over here. The present situation is that, in view of the marked preponderance of the <i>Radical</i> wing in his party, Gladstone must largely rejuvenate his cabinet if it is to survive;
<br>further, that his HOME RULE BILL will at once be thrown out by the Upper House;
<br>but that to be able to dissolve with any certainty of success, he must at the same time introduce ONE MAN ONE VOTE by drawing up a sensible electoral register which will ensure the workers do in fact get what was promised them on paper in general terms in 1867 and 1884 but was subsequently retracted in matters of detail,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> i.e. a 1-1½ million increase in the Labour electorate — and perhaps a SECOND BALLOT;
<br>and that not until <i>this</i> has gone through will he dissolve. So it is a splendid situation so far as we are concerned. Many regards to Ede and you yourself,
<br>Yours
<br>General

<li id="cite_note-8"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-8">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">This refers to the second and third electoral reforms in Britain.<br>Under the reform of 1867 the suffrage in urban areas was granted to all house-owners and house tenants, and also to apartment tenants who had resided at the place in question for no less than a year and paid no less than £10 rent. The property qualification for voters in the counties was reduced to £12 rent a year. As a result of the reform a section of the industrial workers obtained the vote. In 1872 balloting was introduced. The 1884 reform extended the provisions of the 1867 reform to the rural constituencies, thus making part of the rural population eligible to vote. However, even after these reforms the voters made up only 13 per cent of the country's population. The urban and rural poor and all women still had no access to the ballot box.</br></span>

ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester,] 15 June 1854</p>
<p>Dear Marx,</p>
<p>Cluss' letter most amusing. I had wanted to write to you at greater length today, but now find it's too late, so will confine myself to telling you that I have not been able to finish by <i>today</i>, as I had intended, the article on relative strengths and Silistria's chances of relief. That would involve looking up a lot of old stuff and since anyhow, in view of your wife's illness, your greatest difficulty will be to have an article ready for Tuesday's steamer, I shall see what sort of a piece I can concoct for you by then.</p>
<p>Heise, too, is ill now; I don't yet know what ails him, but he's said to be in bed and to have all sorts of pains in his chest. Pfänder got something in his eye which will prevent him from working for a couple of days. Bad luck everywhere, <i>je n'y vois plus clair</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Regards to your wife and children.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

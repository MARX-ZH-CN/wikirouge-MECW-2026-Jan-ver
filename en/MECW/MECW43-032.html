MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>London, 26 June 1868<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>BEST THANKS FOR £10. The business with the children is going relatively <i>well.</i> (Tussychen was very pleased with your letter?<sup>8</sup>) Our doctor is our neighbour, the Irishman Dr Korklow, who is known in the neighbourhood particularly as a scarlet-fever doctor (also in the school which my children attended). In case of need, i.e. as soon as there is the slightest disquieting change, Lafargue will bring a doctor from his hospital. So far this has not been necessary.</p>
<p>I would appreciate it if you could send me a bit more money, since the major part of the £20 had to be spent to partly pay off the most urgent small debts.</p>
<p>Lafargue has told Beesly that 1 article is pending.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>Beesly says it must come in good time to find a place in the <i>August</i> number.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>My head is naturally IN TURMOIL. Since I can do nothing serious, I am writing up the stuff for Eichhoff.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>It will go off tomorrow.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Moor (verte<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>)</p>
<p>Jennychen<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>told Tussy that she had turned from her former higher Chinese character into a LOCALISED (IRISH) BEING and was therefore no longer showing due respect to the EMPEROR. Tussy replied: FORMERLY I CLUNG TO A MAN, NOW I CLING TO A NATION.

While working on the review, Engels wrote out excerpts from <i>Capital,</i> which later made up a synopsis (see Note 26). The review was written around 20 May-1 June 1868, but rejected by the editorial board (see present edition, Vol. 20).</span>

<li id="cite_note-4"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-4">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">A reference to the collection of material for Wilhelm Eichhoff's work on the history of the International Working Men's Association, its foundation, organisation, political and social activity and growth: <i>Die Internationale Arbeiterassociation. Ihre Gründung, Organisation, politisch-sociale Thätigkeit und Ausbreitung.</i> Wilhelm Eichhoff conceived it in the summer of 1868 when his brother Albert, a publisher, planned to put out a Workers' Calendar for 1869. Wilhelm Eichhoff proposed to write a leading item on the establishment, development and activity of the International Working Men's Association. On 6 June 1868, he informed Marx of his intention and asked him to send the necessary material and help him with the article. As early as 27 June Marx sent to Berlin a great number of documents of the Association, newspaper clippings and his own notes. In his reply of 29 June Eichhoff thanked Marx for the material and informed him that he was going to use his notes word for word and supplement and expand them as advised by Marx. Eichhoff's work grew into a pamphlet because of the abundance of material. It was written with Marx's direct assistance. Eichhoff's letters show that as his work progressed, Marx answered his numerous questions, gave advice, made suggestions, and wrote certain parts of the pamphlet. From 12 to 22 July 1868, Marx edited the pamphlet and read the proofs. On 29 July the work was completed and the edition came out in August (see present edition, Vol. 21, p. 322).</span>

<blockquote>
<p>At the General Council meeting of December 15, 1868 Dupont proposed that a short report on the activity of the IWMA since the Brussels Congress should be drawn up and published. Jung was instructed to draw up the resumé and Marx expressed his willingness to help. The resumé contains chiefly the material of the General Council meetings of November 3 and 24, December 22, 1868 and January 5, 1869 and includes Marx's reports. The resolution moved by Marx and Applegarth, probably on Marx's initiative, was not entered in the Minute Book. That is probably why Marx decided to include it in this resumé.

<p>Sir, — At the meeting of this Association, held on the 5th inst., letters were read from Germany announcing the adhesion of 2,000 miners, from Lugau, in Saxony, and arrangements are in progress with two other bodies, of 7,000 miners each, with a view of their Joining the International Working Men's Association.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>A democratic Working Men's Club has been formed at Berlin;<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> the members have joined the International Working Men's Association, and declared themselves opposed to the Prussian Government and to Schultze-Delitzsch. The trades' unions in Germany, on the model of the English ones, with some improvements suggested by the resolutions of the Geneva, Lausanne, and Brussels Working Men's Congresses, brought into existence by the efforts of the International Working Men's Association, number already 110,000 members.</p>
<p>The Belgian secretary [Marie Bernard] stated that in Belgium they had sixty branches, and that they were getting new members at the rate of 1,000 per week.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The secretary for Switzerland [Hermann Jung] stated that he had received information concerning some riband weavers of Basel, who had been locked out.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> The matter will come up again on Tuesday, when the Council will be in possession of the facts.</p>
<p>The secretary for France [Eugene Dupont] reported an agreement come to between the cotton masters of Rouen, the northern and some other departments of France, to reduce the workmen's wages, in order to undersell the English manufacturers in their own markets.</p>
<p>The following resolution, proposed by Citizen Applegarth, and seconded by Citizen Marx, was unanimously agreed to: —
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resolved — That in the opinion of this Council the attempt of the employers of Rouen, of the northern and other departments of France, to reduce the wages of their workpeople with the avowed object of underselling the manufacturers of England in their own markets is deserving the reprobation of the workmen and employers of all nations. That while recognising the right of free competition carried on by legitimate means, we utterly deprecate the extension of trade by reducing the wages of workpeople already underpaid.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Resolved — That the various societies be invited to send delegates to the next meeting of the Council, to be held on Tuesday 19 inst. at eight p. m., to devise the best means to frustrate the unwarrantable attempts of the French manufacturer, and to render to the workmen concerned such assistance as they may need.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> </p>

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE
<br>IN HOBOKEN
<br>London, 26 July 1873
<br>Dear Sorge,
<br>I telegraphed yesterday, cost £1,16: ENGELS TO SORGE, BOX 101, HOBOKEN, NEW YORK. <i>Serraillier YES'<b><sup>2</sup></b></i><b> Therefore, send Serraillier instructions and the material at once so that he has enough time to prepare himself and doesn't have to appear without having read the papers. Ditto the money.</b>
<br>Neither Marx nor I could have taken on the task without setting off the old hue and cry again: they are up to their old tricks, it is Marx who is behind it all, as usual, and he is just using the New-Yorkers as a front! It was only with difficulty that I could persuade Serraillier to take it on; he has found a position at last that can feed him decently and first had to cover himself there; hence the 3 days' delay.
<br>Have sent an invitation to the Congress to Bignami, who is at liberty once more.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Have also informed Serraillier, but as I have already mentioned,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> he no longer has any correspondents in France.
<br>Am sending off to you by today's post 2 parcels d 16 copies of Congress resolutions.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> You could have had them long since had you asked. But since you had no French sections, I thought that those I had sent for the use of the General Council would suffice.—8 or 10 have been sent off to Buenos Aires.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> <br>Have still not received any money. The issue of <i>The International Herald</i> with the English transla- tion of the Congress resolutions is no longer to be obtained. Moreover, Riley has seceded and gone over to the republican camp, and the reports of the FEDERAL COUNCIL are appearing once again in <i>The Eastern Post,</i> to the great annoyance of Jung and Hales, whose organ this was up to the time of the Manchester Congress<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> ; the Congress, however, finished them off. For this reason I have <i>not</i> ordered <i>The International Herald</i> for Meyer.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> <br>The statement about the French mandates has gone off to Italy, Portugal and Spain.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> <br>Marx and I would welcome mandates from there. We shall presumably have to go, for various reasons, although we would, of course, prefer to stay here.
<br>Marx will send on the instalments of <i>Capital,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> if he has not done so already. Four instalments of the French translation are out already,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> the publisher<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> is afraid, and not without reason, that under the present clerical regime it may be confiscated, hence the slow appearance.
<br>Admission for TRADES UNIONS varied. Some paid Id per member, others a lump sum; yet others only enrolled the CENTRAL COUNCIL directly and they too paid a lump sum. In conformity with the relevant article in the Rules, affiliation was approved by simple resolution and a certificate was issued to them.— For lsh. they could receive a printed illustrated version of it to hang on the wall.
<br>The <i>Demokratische Taschenbuch</i> and the <i>Geheimnisse von Europa</i> might be obtainable if further details about the time and place of publication were available; the book-lexica do not stretch to such things and it is hardly worthwhile searching through 20 half-year issues of Hinrich's Bibliography<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> in order to discover finally that they are <i>not</i> there (which is all too likely to be the case with books of this sort).
<br>I still have the Geneva money in my pocket, thanks to the impossible instructions you have lumbered me with. How am I to discover an address to send money to for the widows and orphans of the Commune? This part of the money really must be retained here for your further instructions, since we simply cannot carry out your orders. I would suggest transferring it to Serraillier with a request to devote it to the purpose specified, <i>if at all possible,</i> but otherwise using it for any refugees of the Commune in general. Or else transferring it to the International, which can certainly put it to good use.—The refugees here who have still not been fixed up are a pretty worthless lot. I shall send £10 to Geneva and hold the rest here, pending further instructions from you.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> <br><i>Oberwinder.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> We are entirely of your opinion as far as we can judge from the <i>published</i> documents.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup> Oberwinder has always been a TRIMMER who may have made too much of the backwardness of Austrian conditions in order to have an excuse to act as mediator. Andreas Scheu, on the other hand, is a muddle-headed fellow at best, who wants to stand out as a man who 'goes as far as possible' and whose ambition quite certainly outstrips his abilities. We have long suspected him of being in contact with the Bakuninists, and now, in his programme (<i>Volksstaat</i> No. 59), he has used the phrase taken directly from Bakunin that all other parties <i>constitute a single reactionary mass</i> vis-à-vis the proletariat.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup> <br>We shall reserve our judgment until we learn more. Very suspect too is the fact that Heinrich Scheu, who was present at The Hague, has been here for 4 weeks and only looked up Marx after Mrs Marx had met him in the street. Up to now we have taken care not to discuss the matter with him, otherwise he behaves quite decently and heaps abuse on Bakunin and the Blanquists, but it is peculiar all the same.
<br><i>Würtz</i> was described to me by Pihl as a vain, importunate fellow who imagines he is indispensable and whose indiscretion in pushing himself forward has done them considerable harm. THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT is that, thanks to the Lassalleans in Flensburg and others in North Schleswig, the Danes lean more towards the General Association of German Workers<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup> and have got them- selves into a mess as a result. Hence their silence. The devil take the socialists of all these peasant countries, they, are always fooled by fine phrases.
<br>Look at our Bakuninists in Spain, for example. On Bakunin's orders they abolished the state in Alcoy (the so-called atrocities were, of course, reactionary inventions), and set up a <i>Comité de salut public</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup> (which includes Severino Albarracin, a member of the Bakuninist Federal Council of Valencia and of the Correspon- dence Commission that has now been established in Cordoba<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" id="cite_ref-18">[18]</a></sup> ). So what happens? At the suggestion of some deputies anxious to mediate, peace is concluded; on the one hand, an amnesty, on the other, all resistance is abandoned and the troops move in amidst the jubilation of the bourgeois!<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" id="cite_ref-19">[19]</a></sup> In Barcelona they are neither strong nor courageous enough to attempt anything of the sort, but wherever they are, they strengthen 'anarchy', general confusion, and—they smooth the way for the Carlists.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" id="cite_ref-20">[20]</a></sup> <br>The report on the Alliance<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" id="cite_ref-21">[21]</a></sup> is in print—I read the first proofs yesterday. It is supposed to be ready in a week but I very much doubt that it will. It will be some 160 pages long, I shall advance circa £40 for the printing costs. Edition of 1,000—price: 2 francs=l/9d sterling. I shall send you the first copies to come off the press. But since the thing simply has to be <i>sold</i> so as to recover our costs, please let me know right away how many copies can be <i>ordered</i> for you over there; we shall then have a few more sent. Could you also look around for a <i>reliable</i> bookseller who would distribute it over there. Because of the additional expenses you will probably have to fix the price at about 60-75 cents in your CURRENCY—<i>c'est votre affaire</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" id="cite_ref-22">[22]</a></sup> —at any rate, we here have to receive l/9d per copy, with the exception of those sold through the bookseller since his discount will have to be subtracted, otherwise we shall not recover our costs. The book will hit the autonomists like a bombshell, and if anyone at all can be broken, it will finish off Bakunin. Lafargue and I wrote it together; only the <i>conclusion</i> is by Marx and myself. We shall send it to the entire press. You yourself will be surprised at the infamies revealed in it; even the people from the Commission<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23" id="cite_ref-23">[23]</a></sup> were quite astonished.
<br>The FEDERAL COUNCIL here proceeds on its somnolent way. Apart from the printed reports I see and hear little of them. At all events, Jung, Hales, Mottershead and Co. are finished as far as their pseudo-International is concerned.
<br>Get some Copenhagen addresses for me through Würtz <i>right away,</i> so that I can send there a few copies of the Alliance report. Have not heard another word from Pihl, so that I do not know if his address is still valid.
<br>Apart from that things are jogging along here. My wife<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24" id="cite_ref-24">[24]</a></sup> is in Ramsgate and Mrs Marx was due to go there today too. Jenny Longuet will probably enlarge the family in a week or two (do <i>not</i> write to Marx or Mrs Marx about it until you receive official notice, THEY ARE VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT FAMILY MATTERS). Lafargue and Le Moussu have started up an ENGRAVING business, based on a patent.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25" id="cite_ref-25">[25]</a></sup> <br>Dupont too is attempting to exploit his patent in BRASS INSTRUMENTS, but keeps coming up against obstacles, mostly of his own making, since he knows as much about business as my dog. All this between ourselves. You have no idea how sensitive these people are about private communications, moreover their sensitivity is in direct proportion to their own tendency to gossip.
<br>Finally, it would still be best if one of you were to come. How can we possibly represent the General Council here as effectively as this would be done by one of its members?
<br>Your
<br>F. Engels

However, Ferdinand Lassalle and his followers directed the activities of the Association along reformist lines.<br>With the formation of the International, the sectarian and nationalistic line adopted by the Lassallean leadership became an obstacle to the involvement of the German workers in the international proletarian movement. Thanks to the persistent campaign by Marx, Engels and their followers against Lassalleanism, the foremost German workers had parted company with it by the early 1870s. At the Gotha Congress held in May 1875 the General Association of German Workers merged with the German Social-Democratic Workers' Party (Eisenachers).</br></span>

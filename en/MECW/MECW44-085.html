MARX TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT</p>
<p>IN LEIPZIG</p>
<p>[London,] 4 MAY 1871</p>
<p>Dear LIBRARY,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Just this in great haste. The <i>Papiers et correspondance de la famille impériale,</i> in which <i>Vogt</i> figures among others as someone who was subsidised from the official coffers,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>were <i>not</i> published by the <i>Commune,</i> which has no time for such trivia, but by the <i>gouvernement de la défense,</i> i.e. by Jules Favre et Co., the honest republicans so greatly admired by Vogt in his letters to Kolb.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Extracts from these official publications (and particularly the <i>names of those who received subsidies)</i> were printed in almost all the Paris papers. The cutting I enclose comes from the <i>Petit Journal</i> (issue of <i>3 May 1871</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>), a paper which to this very day is conducting in Paris the same sort of campaign against the Commune as Signor Vogt in Vienna. From a sense of spiritual affinity with Vogt it even prints a (?) after his name.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Vogt himself retracts all his talk when he says at the end of his gibberish:</p>
<p>'It is <i>even</i> possible that my name was misused as far back as 1859, albeit, so it seems, without my first name Karl.'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>So Louis Bonaparte misused 'Vogt' by inscribing his name in his expenses-book! <b>Vogt</b> as someone subsidised by Louis Bonaparte <i>in August 1859</i>—and moreover, just plain 'Vogt', Vogt without 'first name', Vogt <i>sans phrase</i>—naturally, that could only be the 'celebrated' Karl Vogt of Geneva! Mr Vogt is so well aware of that that he says <b>my name<i> was </i>misused'.<i> The good man feels so stung that he forgets to have recourse to the simple evasion: Just as there are many 'Karls' in the world, so too are there many 'Vogts'. What does it matter to me if some 'Vogt' or other without a first name received 40,000 frs in August 1859 from the Emperor's central treasury? No, says Vogt, I am </i>the<i> Vogt, the Vogt to whom people refer even without 'first name', but </i></b><i>my name<b> has been ' </b></i><b>misused</b>!</p>
<p>You must use all this to make the necessary statement in your paper. It is quite absurd to mince words for the sake of Mr Weiß and similar 'People's Partyites'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

Liebknecht stressed the need to publish more material on this question. In connection with this, Engels sent to<i> Der Volksstaat</i> his article 'Once Again "Herr Vogt"' (see present edition, Vol. 22). On the<i> People's Party</i> see Note 71.</span>

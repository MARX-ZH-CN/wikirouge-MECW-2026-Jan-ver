<br>re. No. 2474
<br>To the Royal Oberpräsident of the Rhine Province
<br>His Honour Herr Eichmann, 
<br>at Coblenz
<br>We have the honour to communicate to Your Honour a copy, enclosed, of the order issued to the local Police Superintendent relating to the expulsion of the writer Carl Marx, in execution of the directive of 13th inst.

</center><br>To the Royal Police Superintendent 
<br>Herr Geiger, in Cologne
<br>Following your report of 1st ult., for which the supporting documents are returned enclosed, we decided to ask the Minister of the Interior concerning the expulsion of Dr. C. Marx, informing him at the same time that although we were in no doubt that his expulsion from the state should be carried out forthwith if he gives any specific cause, but that on the other hand it was more doubtful whether his expulsion should take place merely on the grounds of the dangerous tendencies of the newspaper which he has been editing in like manner for some considerable period.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> We hereby send you for your information a copy of the Minister's instructions of 7th inst.,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> as communicated to us, and instruct you to arrange and carry out the expulsion of the aforesaid Marx from the state when direct cause is next given for such action by an unequivocal offence on the part of the aforesaid Marx. We would furthermore observe that we have no knowledge of the allegations which, as we are informed by the Minister, have quite recendy brought upon the aforesaid Marx the grave suspicion of treasonable activities endangering the state,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> and request you to apprise us forthwith of whatever knowledge you may have of them, so that we may determine whether to proceed with the expulsion on those grounds.

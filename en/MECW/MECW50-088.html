<p>ENGELS TO HERMANN BAHR</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p><i>[Draft]</i></p>
<p>[London, beginning of June 1893]</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I regret that I am unable to comply with your request.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>In the first place, it so happens that my party comrades in Germany are conducting an election campaign against, among others, anti-Semitic candidates,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>which means that at this juncture party interests preclude my expressing an impartial opinion about anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>In the second place, I believe that my party comrades in Vienna and in Austria generally would never forgive me were I to allow myself to be interviewed for the <i>Deutsche Zeitung.</i></p>
<p>I remain, Sir, etc.

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">By anti-Semitic candidates, Engels means representatives of Die Christlich-soziale Arbeiterpartei (The Christian Social Worker Party) founded in 1878 by Adolf Stoecker, a reactionary German political figure and advocate of anti-Semitism. This party saw its aim in combatting the socialist movement; subsequently it used the slogan of anti-Semitism to mount a demagogic campaign against financial capital. Its members succeeded in winning support among the backward strata of the peasantry and artisans in some districts of Germany; this success had a part to play in the setup of the poll. In 1895 A. Stoecker transformed his organisation into Die Christlich-soziale Partei. About the election to the German Reichstag, see Note 204.</span>

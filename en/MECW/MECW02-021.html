<p>I sit in the garden. 'Neath the ocean's rim</p>
<p>The old day's sun has slowly slipped from sight,</p>
<p>And hidden shafts that draw their strength from him</p>
<p>Now fill the heavens with scintillating light.</p>
<p>But with day's brilliance fading from the sky,</p>
<p>The flowers stand and grieve in silent sadness;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the birds, safe in the tree-tops high,</p>
<p>Carol their love-songs full of joy and gladness.</p>
<p>Ships that have traced the oceans with their wake</p>
<p>Now lie at anchor in the peaceful bay.</p>
<p>From end to end the timbered bridges shake</p>
<p>As the tired people trudge their homeward way.</p>
<p>The cool wine bubbles in the crystal glass.</p>
<p>I leaf through Caldetön's great comedies,</p>
<p>Drinking my fill to very drunkenness</p>
<p>On heady wine and headier tragedies.
</p>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="2">2</h3>
<p>The radiance in the West is almost gone.</p>
<p>Patience! A new day's coming — Freedom's day!</p>
<p>The sun shall mount his ever-shining throne</p>
<p>And Night's black cares be banished far away.</p>
<p>New flowers shall grow, but not in nursery beds</p>
<p>We raked ourselves and sowed with chosen seeds:</p>
<p>All earth shall be their garden full of light;</p>
<p>' Written in English in the original. (Shelley, Queen Mab.)</p>
<p>All plants shall flourish in far alien lands.</p>
<p>The Palm of Peace shall grace the Northern strands,</p>
<p>The Rose of Love shall crown the frozen wight,</p>
<p>The sturdy Oak shall seek the Southern shore</p>
<p>To make the club that strikes the despot down,</p>
<p>And he who brings his nation peace once more</p>
<p>Shall wear upon his head the oak-leaf crown.</p>
<p>The Aloe, flourishing all over Earth,</p>
<p>Is like the People's spirit everywhere,</p>
<p>As prickly, coarse, and lacking grace as they are,</p>
<p>Till, with a crash, there suddenly bursts forth</p>
<p>Through every obstacle a blossom bright —</p>
<p>The Freedom flame, that glowed concealed from sight;</p>
<p>Its scent is far more like to reach the Lord</p>
<p>Than all the incense of the pious fraud.</p>
<p>Only the Cypress-trees are left alone,</p>
<p>Abandoned in the grove, their meaning gone.
</p>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="3">3</h3>
<p>The birds on their green branches greet the dawn</p>
<p>With paeans of tumultuous song, and know</p>
<p>That when the drifting cloudlets have withdrawn</p>
<p>Their steamy summits to the vales below,</p>
<p>Then shall the sun begin to mount his throne —</p>
<p>These birds are minstrel singers, every one;</p>
<p>Their words fly free as the free winds that blow;</p>
<p>And winds and words as one united go.</p>
<p>These songsters do not haunt the castle walls</p>
<p>(Those stately homes have long since tumbled down),</p>
<p>But, in proud oaks unbent by howling squalls,</p>
<p>Boldly they look towards the rising sun,</p>
<p>Though they be dazzled when his brilliance falls</p>
<p>To ring the earth with radiant light around.</p>
<p>1, too, am one of Freedom's minstrel band.</p>
<p>'twas to the boughs of <i>Börne's</i> great oak-tree</p>
<p>I soared, when in the vales the despot's hand</p>
<p>Tightened the strangling chains round Germany.</p>
<p>Yes, I am of those plucky birds that make</p>
<p>Their course through Freedom's bright aethereal sea.</p>
<p>Though I be just a sparrow in their wake,</p>
<p>Rather that little sparrow would I be</p>
<p>Than the caged nightingale that can't take wing</p>
<p>And only to a prince's car may sing.
</p>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="4">4</h3>
<p>No longer does the cargo vessel press</p>
<p>Across the ocean to enrich the few</p>
<p>Or swell the greedy merchant's revenue:</p>
<p>It bears the seeds of human happiness.</p>
<p>It is a noble stallion prancing high,</p>
<p>Whose rider slays all hypocrites and crawlers,</p>
<p>It is the fearless scourge of human dolours,</p>
<p>It is a thought that dreams of Liberty.</p>
<p>The flag bears not the royal coat of arms</p>
<p>For the ship's frightened crew to tremble under;</p>
<p>It bears the cloud on which, after the thunder,</p>
<p>After the lightning bolts of raging storms,</p>
<p>The reconciling Freedom rainbow forms.
</p>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="5">5</h3>
<p>The bridge of Love shall throw its spans unseen</p>
<p>Across from heart to heart; between the piers</p>
<p>Runs Passion's wild and ever-rushing stream,</p>
<p>The swiftly flowing torrent of the years.</p>
<p>The bridge is diamond hard: it will not sag.</p>
<p>Across goes Freedom's bravely shining flag.</p>
<p>Across goes Man. Where'er his feet may lead him,</p>
<p>Wherever he may choose to cast his eye,</p>
<p>He sees a friendly roof against the sky</p>
<p>And knows that food and drink are there to meet him;</p>
<p>A very home from home awaits to greet him,</p>
<p>Wherever he may make his bed and lie.</p>
<p>A bridge of purer faith shall pierce the clouds.</p>
<p>Man shall ascend it, climbing without fear</p>
<p>Its heavenward steps to gaze on, humbly proud,</p>
<p>The Eternal Archetype of All the Spirits.</p>
<p>Out of his bosom issues forth Mankind,</p>
<p>And to his bosom Men return again,</p>
<p>All conscious links in the great spirit-chain</p>
<p>By which Eternal Matter is confined.
</p>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="6">6</h3>
<p>New wine shall fill your glasses to the brim,</p>
<p>Pure Freedom wine's intoxicating brew:</p>
<p>Not the unwary senses to bedim,</p>
<p>But jaded senses to exchange for new,</p>
<p>That with revived perception you may hear</p>
<p>The spheres in heaven singing high and low;</p>
<p>That the blood coursing through your veins may clear,</p>
<p>Transformed into pure Aether, which flows through</p>
<p>The Infinities; that your eye-beams may spear</p>
<p>Primordial Space, like warriors bold that go</p>
<p>To storm the starry summits without fear.</p>
<p>Between, like jack-o'-Lanterns in the sky,</p>
<p>Images of past woe are gliding by.
</p>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="7">7</h3>
<p>And there shall rise another Calderön,</p>
<p>Pearl-fisher in the tide of poetry,</p>
<p>With images like flames ascending from</p>
<p>The layered wood of the sweet Cedar-tree.</p>
<p>With golden lyre, he shall exalt in song</p>
<p>The bloody stamping out of Tyranny.</p>
<p>Mankind shall hear proud Victory's refrain,</p>
<p>And Peace shall flourish in the world again.</p>
<p>He too shall sing how Mankind made a stand</p>
<p>Against the cruel hordes of Tyranny</p>
<p>Upon <i>Mantible Bridge</i>* <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> ; how that brave band</p>
<p>Fought on through levelled spears to victory</p>
<p>And so set foot on Freedom's hallowed land;</p>
<p>How <i>Doctor of His Honour</i>** came to be</p>
<p>Man, like the <i>Constant Prince</i>,*** condemned to languish</p>
<p>In chains until deliverance from anguish;</p>
<p>How Freedom came, <i>The Daughter of the Air</i>,****</p>
<p>Descending earthwards from aethereal space</p>
<p>To sing her magic songs, so wondrous fair;</p>
<p>How <i>Life</i> became a <i>Dream</i>***** of joy and grace,</p>
<p>And how the Cup of Happiness shone clear</p>
<p>Of furious ferment showing not a trace;</p>
<p>And how the sun shall put the clouds to flight,</p>
<p>Bringing sweet <i>April-and-May-Mornings</i>****** light.
</p>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="8">8</h3>
<p>But say, when is the new sun going to rise?</p>
<p>When will the bad old times be cracked asunder?</p>
<p>We saw the old sun sinking in the skies —</p>
<p>How long must night's oppression keep us under?</p>
<p>The melancholy moon peers through the cloud,</p>
<p>And white mists, bivouacked in the vales below,</p>
<p>Hide all that lives on earth beneath their shroud.</p>
<p>Like blind men tapping through the dark we go.</p>
<p>Patience! For look, already heavenward bound,</p>
<p>The sun would chase the gloomy clouds away.</p>
<p>The very mists that crawl along the ground</p>
<p>Are Spirits' dawn-breeze-wakened roundelay.</p>
<p>The morning star dances his upward way.</p>
<p>The mists are pierced by shafts of blood-red fire.</p>
<p>Do not the flowers unfold to greet the day?</p>
<p>Do you not hear the joyful feathered choir?</p>
<p>Now half the heavens are filled with radiance bright.</p>
<p>The snow-capped mountains blaze with ruby light.</p>
<p>The golden clouds rear up their noble heads</p>
<p>Like the sun's fiery chariot-drawing steeds.</p>
<p>Look yonder, where the densest light rays run</p>
<p>In joyous throng to greet the new-born sun!</p>

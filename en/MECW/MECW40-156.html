ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester, 26 March 1858]</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Herewith a five-pound note, number as below.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>'Cavalry' progressing well. I have again found some good stuff in Mommsen's Römische Geschichte (Hannibal's cavalry). Unfortunately it's difficult to get hold of anything about the Seven Years War.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>You'll have received the Guardians I sent off yesterday. They were the only ones containing reports from Paris or anything at all of special interest.</p>
<p>In haste—it's half past seven—and the office-boys are waiting to lock up.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

ENGELS TO STRUTT AND PARKER</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London,] 23 September 1890</p>
<p>Dear Sirs,</p>
<p>In pursuance of a conversation I had yesterday with Mr Jakins, I wrote to him a letter stating what repairs and alterations I should expect to be made in the house occupied by me before signing a new three years agreement. This letter he promised to lay before you.</p>
<p>As this question cannot well be settled before the impending quarterday Mr Jakins found it quite natural that I should give you notice to quit, so as to protect myself. This notice I beg to enclose. It is however perfectly understood that I am willing to withdraw such notice again as soon as we shall have satisfactorily settled the conditions and terms of the new agreement.</p>
<p>Trusting that this will not be a matter of difficulty</p>
<p>I remain, etc.</p>
<p>Gentlemen,</p>
<p>I hereby give you notice that on the 25th day of March next (1891) I shall quit and deliver up possession of the house and premises I now hold on the Estate of the late Richard R. Rothwell Esq. and situated at 122 Regent's Park Road, N. W. in the Parish of St Pancras. Dated this 23rd day of September 1890.

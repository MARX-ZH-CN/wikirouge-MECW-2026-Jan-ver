MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 21 May 1853 28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Today the bill for £25 goes off to Freiligrath, who will immediately notify Lièvre of its receipt.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Herewith Wolff's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>address; he is still sulking. By the by, now that so much has been brought out into the open, I have become convinced that Dronke has been purveying the most abject lies, rumours and gossip at my expense. The only activity, indeed, of which this self-important midget and WOULD-BE Blanqui was capable. His addiction to tittle-tattle had turned him into such a dyed-in- the-wool liar that he himself no longer knew what he was saying or had said.</p>
<p>Don't for God's sake send me <i>any more</i> copies of Weydemeyer's statement or my own.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>Here alone I have 14 of each which I received the day before yesterday. It would have been more to the point had Weydemeyer sent at least 2 or 3 copies of 'Hirsch's' revelations. E.g., Schabelitz could make use of 1 in Switzerland should further proceedings be taken against him. I like the inevitable Weydemeyerian misprint, where Bangya is made to say <i>Ähnliches</i> instead of <i>Rühmliches</i>.</p>
<p>Nothing else of interest here. I have not seen Blind recently. Have you sent him his Herzen<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>?</p>
<p><i>The People's Paper</i> is on the up and up and, for the time being, financially secure. Jones is convening mass meetings for 19 June <i>et seq.</i> at Blackstone Edge, Skurcoat Moor, Mount Sorrell and Nottingham Forest.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Apropos. I was only able to give Pieper 10/-, Strohn having shown me the wrong RAILWAY GUIDE which caused me to miss the PARLIAMENTARY TRAIN,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>so that I had to travel 2nd class.</p>
<p>Write to me soon.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 26 August 1854 28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>My wife got back on Wednesday,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>quite well. In the Fatherland, she tells me, everyone is down in the dumps on account of the 'uncertain conditions'.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine what has become of Cluss. The fellow hasn't written for months. Perhaps it's too hot over there.</p>
<p>It is a very good thing that you are rid of Heise. I don't see that a 'loafer' of this sort can be of any interest. I have not, of course, seen Imandt's correspondence with Dronke and Heise, but I do know that, if he takes part in their childish nonsense, he does so at most in a 'theoretical' sense. Down here, Imandt lives the life of a sober, hard-working citizen.</p>
<p>I have heard from Lassalle who announces triumphantly that the Hatzfeldt woman's 7, or rather 8, years' war is now over.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Enfin!</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>'Victory' for the old woman, who would appear to have emerged from the campaign with her virtue and, what is more, her money bags, <i>vierge</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>Lassalle now intends to move his domicile to Berlin, but has already heard talk about difficulties with the police.</p>
<p>Meyer writes to tell me that the trial of the Berlin demagogues<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>(in which Gottfried's Gottfried played a part) has been quashed by the court in Berlin (which, he doesn't say), 'because <i>Hentze</i>, the principal witness for the prosecution, was "questionable" '. <i>Qu'en dis-tu?</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>I have also had a letter from Miquel in Paris. He intended to come here but first he had cholera and then a haemorrhage, whereupon his doctors suggested that he had better drop the idea of sea travel and make for home overland with all dispatch. Bad luck.</p>
<p>Cherval, who under the name of 'Cramer'—this time the real name was the pseudonym—had diverse experiences in Switzerland, <i>inter alia</i> engraving plates for Mr Vogt, who had taken him under his wing, is now living in Paris. I have his address.</p>
<p>Daniels has been seriously ill for months and it seems doubtful whether he'll pull through.</p>
<p>Reports, particularly in the <i>Débats</i>, suggest that there is a state of splendid anarchy in Spain. So far as I can gather from the papers, the Polish and Hungarian emigres in the Turkish Asiatic army do nothing but engage in mischief, place-seeking and petty intrigues. <i>Toujours les mêmes</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Vale faveque.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Totus tuus</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>K. M.

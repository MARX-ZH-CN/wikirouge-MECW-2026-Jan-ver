ENGELS TO LUDWIG KLOPFER</p>
<p>IN GENEVA</p>
<p>London, 22 May 1883</p>
<p>Dear Mr Klopfer,</p>
<p>I should be only too glad to help you if I possibly could. However I have <i>absolutely no</i> publishing or literary connections in Germany and should not know whom to approach.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> The party, however, still has various periodicals, etc., in Germany, e. g. Liebknecht's and Kautsky's <i>Neue £eit</i> in Stuttgart (Dietz Verlag); you should get Becker to give you letters for them. If anything can be done for you, it is over there; we here are as cut off from everything as you are in Geneva.</p>
<p>Your letter of the 9th bears the Geneva postmark of the 13th. I hope that this will at least partly explain my delay in replying.</p>
<p>Trusting that the adoption of the above course will enable you to achieve your object, I remain,</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>F. Engels

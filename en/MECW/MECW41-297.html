MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 2 December 1863</p>
<p>DEAR FREDERICK,</p>
<p>Two hours ago a telegram arrived, saying my mother<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>was dead. Fate laid claim to one of our family. I myself have already had one foot in the grave. Circumstances being what they were, I, presumably, was needed more than my mater.</p>
<p>I have got to go to Trier to settle the question of the legacy. Was in much doubt as to what Allen would say, as it is only 3 days since I first began taking a recuperative WALK of half an hour a day.</p>
<p>However, Allen has given me 2 enormous bottles of medicine to take with me and actually thinks it advisable for me to go. The wound hasn't stopped discharging yet, but all along the route I should find good Samaritanesses<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>to apply the plaster for me.</p>
<p>I must now ask you to send me enough money <i>by return</i> to enable me to leave for Trier <i>forthwith. Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Postcard] [Argenteuil,] 15 June 1882</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>I thought I should be able to report progress over the past week or so. But the <i>temperature fell</i> as soon as I arrived, in fact <i>one day after my arrival.</i> The weather, therefore, according to what I've been told by Dr Dourlen, as also by his MEDICAL FRIEND<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>in Enghien, won't allow me to begin my sulphur treatment yet. In my former condition, during the happy time when I could smoke, I should have found the weather DELIGHTFUL. True, the sky is overcast more often than not, a bit of rain now and again, gusts of wind, not so much summer as late autumn, but nice weather for all that, if you're in good health!</p>
<p>Yesterday — as a result of a note to St Paul the Gascon<sup>b</sup> — he came to visit me. I WAS GLAD TO SEE HIM. In compliance with my <i>avis'</i> he will keep silent — <i>until further orders</i> — about my presence here.</p>
<p>I go early to bed, get up late, spend a large part of the day with the children and Jennychen and take advantage of every favourable moment to go for a short stroll. All things considered I feel better than AT ANY TIME in Algiers, Monte Carlo or Cannes. It seems likely that the weather too will change for the better here. I shall write you a letter as soon as I've made my first trip to Enghien.</p>
<p>Best wishes to everyone.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Moor</p>
<p>Tussychen has sent Jennychen an interesting eye-witness account of the Hyde Park meeting.</p>

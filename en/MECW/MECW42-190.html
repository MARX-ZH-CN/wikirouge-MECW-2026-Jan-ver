MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 1 October 1866</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>I do not know whether I told you last time I wrote that there is a <i>bill of exchange</i> (no longer in the LANDLORD'S hands) outstanding against me for the rent. Sawyer had written that the bill was due on the 2nd inst., i.e., tomorrow. I called on him yesterday, as by my reckoning the thing could not be due until 3 October, as I had drawn the bill on 1 July for 3 MONTHS, so that 3 days sight must be added. And it turned out I was right. The amount is £46 (3 QUARTERS), and I have been <i>sans sou</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> for many weeks, since the SMALL SUMS, which were still obtainable via pawnbrokers, dried up.</p>
<p>As I am furthermore now HARD PRESSED from the daily 'supplies' which have once more accumulated in recent months and in present circumstances (Lafargue) must avoid any <i>éclat</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> more than ever, I would leave for the Continent at once to see what I can arrange there 'personally'. However, I must defer that until my manuscript<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> is completed, so that I can take it with me and am not subjected to fresh interruption.</p>
<p>You must forgive me for constantly BorHERing and plaguing you with my private morass. I had put too much reliance on having the money from Holland.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. Marx</p>
<p>What do you think of Moilin?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </p>

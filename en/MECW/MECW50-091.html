ENGELS TO STOJAN NOKOFF</p>
<p>IN GENEVA</p>
<p>London, 9 June 1893 122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear citizen Nokoff,</p>
<p>A thousand thanks for the trouble you have taken in being the intermediary between the editorial board and myself, and dispatching No. 2 of the Bulgarian <i>Social-Demokrat.</i> I, for my part, dare to count on your good will in asking you to forward the lines enclosed to his address.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> If it is not too much to ask, I would be grateful if you would let me know, merely by postcard, whether I am mistaken in identifying Sevlievo<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> as the town otherwise known as Philippopolis? I do not have a Bulgarian dictionary, my Serbian dictionary offers no clarification, but I have the vague impression of having read somewhere that this was the Bulgarian name of this town. 222 If I am correct, you need not reply.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>F. Engels

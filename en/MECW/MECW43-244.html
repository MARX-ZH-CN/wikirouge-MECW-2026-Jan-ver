ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 16 August 1869</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Yesterday I received a telegram informing me that my mother will not be getting to Ostend until Wednesday evening. Since I must now wait for a letter from home providing me with more detailed information and since yet another reason requires that I still be here tomorrow, I telegraphed you today that I will not be coming until Wednesday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>Also, I am worried that if in the meantime the Lafargues should come I may not find night quarters in your doubtless full house and, this being the case, would like to know whether I might find lodging somewhere near you.</p>
<p>Tussy's tooth is out; the dentist found that since one of the three roots was inflamed the only solution was to extract. The pain is now gone.</p>
<p>I am planning to take the 3:30 Midlands train that arrives in London at 8:50.</p>
<p>Best greetings.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

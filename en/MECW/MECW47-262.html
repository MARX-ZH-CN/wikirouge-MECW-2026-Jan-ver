ENGELS TO HERMANN SCHLÜTER</p>
<p>IN HOTTINGEN-ZURICH</p>
<p>London, 3 June 1886</p>
<p>Dear Mr Schlüter,</p>
<p>Mrs Wischnewetzky has sent me some printed sheets<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>which I have got to return; she also gave me a Paris address, which I can't decipher properly, and without telling me whether they should be sent there. For safety's sake I am taking the liberty of posting my reply and cor- rections to you, with the request that you kindly forward them. You may perhaps know the Paris address, or else you could make inquiries at the Pension Tièfenau — it looks like c/Drexel, Harjes &amp; Co., Paris.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>I apologise for putting you to this trouble.</p>
<p>Your Chartism's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>turn will come round as soon as the English translation of <i>Capital</i> allows me a free moment. Printing has just begun and, as only the first half is ready for the press, I absolutely must attend to the remainder first.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>Hence I <i>cannot</i> allow anything more to stand in its way just now.</p>
<p>Regards to Ede.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F. Engels

<li id="cite_note-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-3">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">On 10 March 1886 Hermann Schlüter informed Engels that he intended to pub lish as a separate pamphlet a speech by the Reverend Joseph Stephens, one of the leaders of the Chartist movement, which had been printed in Georg Weerth's arti cle 'Joseph Rayner Stephens, Prediger zu Staleybridge, und die Bewegung der en glischen Arbeiter im Jahre 1839' contained in<i> Rheinische Jahrbücher zur gesellschaftlichen Reform,</i> Herausgegeben unter Mitwirkung Webserer von Hermann Pütt mann, Vol. II, Belle-Vue, near Constanz, 1846. Schlüter asked Engels to look through the introduction he had written for this publication. He later changed his plans and published the manuscript anonymously after Engels had looked through it under the title<i> Die Chartistenbewegung in England,</i> Hottingen-Zürich, 1887 (see also Note 453).</span>

<li id="cite_note-4"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-4">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The idea of translating<i> Capital</i> into English occurred to Marx as early as 1865, when he was working on the manuscript (see Marx's letter to Engels of 31 July 1865, present edition, Vol. 42). The British journalist and member of the Interna tional's General Council, Peter Fox, was to help Marx find a publisher. However, this matter was not settled due to Fox's death in 1869. The English translation of the first volume of<i> Capital,</i> edited by Engels, did not appear until after Marx's death, in January 1887, and was published by Swan Sonnenschein, Lowrey &amp; Co., London. The translation was done by Samuel Moore and Edward Aveling between mid-1883 and March 1886. Eleanor Marx-Aveling took part in the preparatory work for the edition (see also this volume, pp. 33 and 127-28).</span>

LAURA MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 13 January 1868</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>As Mohr is once more being victimised by his old enemies, the carbuncles, and is, by the arrival of the latest, made to feel very ill at ease in a sitting posture, he has asked me to write you these lines in his stead.</p>
<p>As regards the article for <i>The Fortnightly Review,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>I am to tell you that there is no question of a mere brief notice like the reviews of books generally found at the back of that periodical, but of an article of the length of those usually inserted.</p>
<p>Also I am to beg you to send back, as soon as possible, the earlier numbers of the <i>Courrier français</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>With best regards from all of us and in the hope that the late frequent Christmas entertainments you have been 'undergoing' may not have interfered with your health, I remain, dear Engels,</p>
<p>Affectionately yours,</p>
<p>Laura Marx

As can be seen from their subsequent correspondence, Marx and Engels exchanged opinions several times on the content and form of the article.<br>In spite of Professor Beesly's request, the review was rejected by the editorial board and has only been preserved in manuscript form (see present edition, Vol. 20).</span>

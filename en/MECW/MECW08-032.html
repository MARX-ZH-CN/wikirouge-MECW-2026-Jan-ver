<p><i>Cologne,</i> November 24. <i>The Minister Manteuffel declared yesterday to the imperial commissioners at present in Berlin that the Prussian Government would not submit to the decision of the Frankfurt Assembly to form a popular Ministry</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <i>because this was an</i> <b>internal</b> <i>matter</i>.</p>
<p>Hence <i>Manteuffel</i> agrees with us that the decision of the Frankfurt Assembly on the <b>refusal to pay taxes</b> is also null and void, because it concerns only an <b>internal</b> matter.</p>
<p>It is possible, of course, that the Brandenburg-Manteuffel Ministry will help to convert the <i>Rhine Province into an external matter for Prussia</i>.

For this purpose, first Bassermann (one of the liberal leaders) and then Simson and Hergenhahn went to Berlin as imperial commissioners. In mid-November the Frankfurt National Assembly adopted a decision calling on the Central Authority to help, through the imperial commissioners in Berlin, to form a Ministry which would enjoy the confidence of the country, that is a Ministry more acceptable to the Prussian bourgeoisie than the obviously counter-revolutionary Brandenburg-Manteuffel Ministry. However, this decision proved ineffective because the Frankfurt Assembly's liberal majority openly disapproved of the campaign for refusal to pay taxes as a means of struggle against the coup d'état. The mediation of the imperial commissioners proved to be helpful to the counter-revolutionaries since it diverted the democratic forces in the German states from real support of the Prussian National Assembly in its struggle against the Brandenburg-Manteuffel Ministry</span>

ENGELS TO PAUL ARNDT</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p><i>[Draft]</i></p>
<p>[London,] 5 December 1893</p>
<p>Dear Mr Arndt,</p>
<p>I, too, can understand that you should have preferred not to call on me on a Sunday since, in view of various things that have happened in the meantime, I cannot possibly consort with you on the same easy footing as hitherto.</p>
<p>However, if you wish to speak to me, I shall be at home the day after tomorrow, Thursday, from 8 pm. onwards.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>F.E.
</p>

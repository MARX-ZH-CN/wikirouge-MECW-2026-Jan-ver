MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN RAMSGATE</p>
<p>[London,] 9 September 1873</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>Letter from Hepner enclosed.<sup>780</sup></p>
<p>The copies of the <i>Alliance</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>which were meant to go to your house have not yet arrived, even though Darson had them as early as last Saturday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>. Therefore, so far I have had nothing to send off but the 12 copies still at your home.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>That sorry piece of work signed Perret, Duval, etc., was written—according to Trusov—by <i>ClusereL</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>I said to you at the time that it could not have been written by those oafs because of t h e AFFECTATION OF A SMALL SORT OF LITERARY STYLE.

ENGELS TO NIKOLAI DANIELSON</p>
<p>IN ST PETERSBURG</p>
<p>London, 2 September 1891</p>
<p>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>Today I return to you six more letters which include everything to end of 1878 — remainder will follow.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Your prophecy about the famine has but too soon been verified, and we here in England, too, will have to suffer severely. The crop seemed excellent on the whole, when about 10 days ago terrible weather set in—just as corn cutting began in the South of Eng- land— and played terrible havoc with both cut and uncut corn, 20 to 30 per cent of the crop are said to be severely damaged if not ruined. There is but one advantage connected with this calamity: it will render a war impossible for some 20 months to come, and that, in the present state of universal armament and mutual distrust, is a blessing.</p>
<p>Allow me to return, on another occasion, to your very interesting communication of 1 May.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Today I am on the eve of a journey and my principal object is to request you in future to address all your let- ters to</p>
<p>Mrs Kautsky, 122 Regent's Park Road, N. W. London. The letters will be handed to me <i>unopened,</i> so there is no necessity for a second cover <i>[enveloppe).</i> The fact is I shall be so often absent from London<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> that I am afraid letters addressed in the usual way might</p>
<p>miscarry; I should have to trust to the intelligence and punctuality of servants.</p>
<p>My health is on the whole excellent; but I require once a year a hol- iday of about eight weeks and a considerable change of air. A sea voyage is always the best remedy for me. If I keep as well as I expect to be in a month, I shall set at once about the 3rd volume,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> it <i>must</i> be finished. But I better not make any promises as to time.</p>
<p>Very truly yours,</p>
<p>P.W. Rosher<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> </p>

ENGELS TO PYOTR LAVROV</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>London, 24 March 1883</p>
<p>My dear Lavrov,</p>
<p>I have received a long telegram from Moscow asking me to lay a wreath on Marx's grave on behalf of the students of the Petrovsky Academy of Agriculture; not having my address, they telegraphed the editorial department of <i>The Daily News.</i> Now they are asking me to let them know the price of the wreath and my address. But it is not signed with a name — merely: Students of the Petrovsky Academy in Moscow.</p>
<p>To whom should I reply? Perhaps you could advise me. As the telegram arrived after the burial, and the grave has today been re-opened for the burial of Longuet's little boy,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> who died last Tuesday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I shall not be able to lay the wreath on it till next week. But then I should like to let the worthy young men know that I have received their telegram and carried out the task they entrusted to me.</p>
<p>Yours ever, in haste,</p>
<p>F. Engels

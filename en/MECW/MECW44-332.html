JENNY MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London, around 13 September 1870]</p>
<p>Dear Mr Engels,</p>
<p>Warmest thanks for your kind long and interesting letter.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>To come back to the subject of our house,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>I am sorry that you were put to the trouble of writing once again. The position with the wallpapering is as follows: Smith and the other agent said they were prepared to paper the room if you desired it; they both thought, however, that the red wallpaper, once it had been cleaned, mended and generally renovated, would be preferable to any other cheaper one, that it was 3 times as expensive as the one in the FRONT ROOM and that it was a genuine DINING ROOM paper. So I went back with Lenchen<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>to have another look at it, as I did not trust my own judgment entirely, and Lenchen was <i>definitely</i> of 'Smith's' opinion and still claims that she prefers it to any other. I remained undecided and since I did not really know what to do, I waited for your letter. It might perhaps be best if you could look at it for yourself and made up your own mind. It will only take a day if you want to have a new one. Please let me know what you would like to have. Apart from that, the house seemed in good REPAIR from top to bottom, and neither of us could find anything amiss. Two broken windows were just being replaced and also a new <i>robinet</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>(I can't just think of the German word) on the stone sink in the washhouse. Apart from that everything seemed to be in good order and I think that the man will replace anything still missing without delay. He appeared very willing in every respect.</p>
<p>At any rate, you must stay with us for a few nights and use our house as a base from which to make your ARRANGEMENTS. We shall be able to find room for everyone. For our house is a veritable palace and much too large and dear for us in my view.</p>
<p>Serraillier has written a very interesting letter from Paris which confirms everything we already knew long since about those amiable phrasemongers.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Serraillier says you can almost get torn in pieces if you tell the truth, and even the better and the best ones are living on their memories of 1792. He is absolutely delighted about Rochefort, whom he has now seen for the second time, and he has enrolled in the home-guard unit <i>du cher</i> Gustave.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>It might be better not to tell Dupont for the moment that Serraillier is helping to defend <i>le sol sacré</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>He might after all start to suffer from <i>le coeur gros</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>and want to be off. <i>Et à quoi bon?</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>With his quick temper Dupont would make a fine impression. We have had no news from the Lafargues. I am overjoyed that he is SAFE.</p>
<p>Jenny is feeling better, but is greatly affected by the fate of the <i>grrande nation,</i> with which both girls<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>are completely infatuated. Time will change all that. Indeed, we have all experienced that enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Best regards to your dear wife<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup>from</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Jenny Marx

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE</p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>London, 15 December 1888</p>
<p>In haste: You might tell Speyer that Lessner has found his sister-in-law. His people are still living in the old house and the woman has promised to write to the Speyers straight away. However, I did not wish to delay sending you this information.</p>
<p>Volume III<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>is proving more of a handful than I had imagined. I have had to recast the whole of one chapter from the existing material and there's another, of which only the title exists, which I am having to produce myself. However it's going ahead and will cause much surprise among their worships the political economists. My eyes are better and I still feel five years younger than I did last July. Regards to your wife.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Mr. Fox has rolled up a rather phantastic picture of the foreign policy of the French Ancient Regime. According to his view, France allied herself with Sweden, Poland, and Turkey in order to protect Europe from Russia. The truth is that France contracted those alliances in the 16th and 17th centuries, at a time when Poland was still a powerful state and when Russia, in the modern sense of the word, did not yet exist. There existed then a Grand Duchy of Muscovy, but there existed not yet a Russian Empire. It was therefore not <i>against Russia</i> that France concluded those alliances with the Turks, the Magyars, the Poles, and. the Swedes. She concluded them against <i>Austria</i> and against the <i>German Empire</i>, as a means of extending the power, the influence, and the territorial possessions of France over Germany, Italy, Spain. I shall not enter upon details. It will suffice for my purpose to say, that France used those alliances in the midst of the 17th century to bring about the <i>treaty of Westphalia</i>, by which Germany was not only dismembered, one part of it being given to France and the other to Sweden, but every little German prince and baron obtained the treaty right to sell his country and France obtained a <i>protectorate</i> over Germany. After the treaty of Westphalia, in the second part of the 17th century, Louis XIV, the true representative of the old Bourbon policy at the time of its strength, bought the king of England, Charles II, in order to ruin the Dutch republic. His <i>system of vandalism and perfidy</i> then carried out against Holland, Belgium, Spain, Germany and Piedmont — during about 40 years, cannot be better characterised than by the one fact, that <i>in a memorandum</i>, drawn up in 1837 by the Russian chancellery for the information of <i>the present Czar</i>, the system of war and diplomacy of Louis XIV from the middle to the end of the 17th century is <i>recommended as the model system</i> to be followed by Russia.</p>
<p>—Modern Russia dates only from the 18th century, and it is therefore from that time alone that resistance to Russia could have entered into the policy of France or any other European state.</p>
<p>I proceed at once to <i>the time of Louis XV</i> which Mr. Fox has justly pointed out as the epoch when the French foreign policy was most favourable to Poland and most hostile to Russia.</p>
<p>Now there happened three great events under the regime of Louis XV — in regard to Russia and Poland, 1) the so-called <i>Polish succession war</i>, 2) <i>the Seven Years' War</i>, and 3) <i>the first partition of Poland</i>. I shall consider the attitude taken by the French government in regard to these events.

<h3 class="mw-headline" id="ME20-48-2">1. The So-called Polish Succession War</h3>
<p>After the death of <i>Augustus II</i> (king of Poland and elector of Saxony), in <i>September 1733</i>, one party of the Polish aristocracy wanted to elect his son <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>as king. He was supported by Russia and Austria, because he had promised to the Czarina <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>not to reclaim Courland, formerly a fief of Poland, and because he had promised to the Emperor <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>the guarantee of the pragmatic sanction. The other party, instigated by France, elected <i>Stanislaus Leszczinski</i>, who had formerly been made Polish king by Charles XII of Sweden and who was at that time the father-in-law of Louis XV. There broke consequently a war out between France on the one hand, Russia and Austria on the other. This is <i>the only war which France has ever professedly carried on behalf of Poland.</i> France made war in Germany and Italy, but as far as her Polish protégé was concerned, limited herself to sending 1,500 men to Dantzick, then a Polish town. The war having lasted two years, what was its upshot? A <i>treaty of peace</i> (<i>Peace of Vienna, October 1735</i>), by which the <i>duchy of Lorraine</i>, a German fief, was <i>incorporated into France</i>, and the Bourbon dynasty planted in <i>Naples</i> and <i>Sicily</i>, the same dynasty of which king Bomba <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>was the last lively representative. In all other respects this <i>"war about the throne of Poland"</i> ended in acknowledging the <i>Russian candidate</i>, Augustus III, as king of Poland, but securing to Louis XV's father-in-law the prerogative of being called king and a very large yearly pension to be paid by Poland. This war instigated and carried on by France under false pretences, ended in the humiliation of Poland, the extension of the Russian power, and great disadvantages to Turkey and Sweden, which France had also driven into a false position and then left in the lurch. But I shall not enter upon these details.</p>
<p>The conduct of the French government cannot be excused on the plea that the British government prevented it during this so-called <i>Polish succession war</i> of acting in the right direction. On the contrary. When the Emperor Charles VI appealed to England, the latter clung to the Anglo-French alliance which had continued since 1716 and was barren of any good results whatever. At all events: this time the French government's good designs for Poland were not baffled by England.</p>
<p>Before leaving the subject, I. must mention that the <i>peace between Turkey and Russia</i>, brought about by French mediation (<i>Villeneuve</i>, French ambassador) in 1739, was a great blow to Poland. I quote <i>Rulhière;</i> he says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"it <i>annulled</i> the <i>treaty of the Pruth, the only shield that remained to the Poles"</i> ("cet unique bouclier qui restait à la Pologne"), et le nouveau traité, signé à Belgrad, in 1739, déclara dans son dernier article "que toutes les conventions antérieures n'auraient <i>plus aucune force".</i> <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="ME20-48-3">2. The Seven Years' War (1756-1763)</h3><a id="2._The_Seven_Years'_War_(1756-1763)"></a>
<p>I come now to the 7 Years' War.</p>
<p>Mr. Fox has told you that that war was very unhappy for France, because it deprived her, to the benefit of England, of most of her colonies. But this is not the question before us. What we have to inquire into is, what part France played during that war in regard to Poland and Russia.</p>
<p>You must know that from <i>1740 to 1748</i>, during the so-called Austrian succession war, France had allied herself with <i>Frederick II of Prussia</i> against <i>Russia, Austria and England.</i> During the <i>Seven Years' War</i> she allied herself with <i>Austria and Russia</i> against <i>Prussia and England, so</i> that, at all events, during this war England was the official enemy, and France the avowed ally of Russia.</p>
<p>It was first in <i>1756</i> under the Abbe Bernis, and then again <i>1758</i> under the duke of Choiseul, that France concluded her treaty with Austria (and Russia), against Prussia.</p>
<p>Let us hear <i>Rulhière. (Histoire de l'Anarchie de Pologne</i> etc. Paris 1819. 2nd edit.)
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When <i>Count Broglie</i> arrived in <i>1752 as ambassador at Varsovie, France had no party in Poland.</i> People thought of the promises which France had already so often failed to fulfil (auxquelles la France avait déjà si souvent manqué). They had not forgotten that three times since a century, France had rallied around her powerful Polish factions... but that after having formed them with passion (ardeur), she had always abandoned them with levity (elle les avait chaque fois abandonnées avec légèreté). She had left in distress the majority of those who had trusted to the seductions of her pretended projects for the welfare of the republic" <i>(t. I, 213).</i> ("Elle avait laissé dans l'infortune la plupart de ceux qui s'étaient livrés à la séduction de ces prétendus projets pour le salut de la république.")</p>
<p>"The Duke of Broglie, after three years' activity, had formed a counterparty against the Czartoryski, <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>won over the Polish court, put into motion the Swedes, the Tartars, the Turks, opened a connection with the Cossacks of the Ukraine" etc. <i>"Frederick II</i> contributed to call into life this formidable coalition against the Russians, from which he expected himself his own security. The Russian minister <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>had lost all influence at Warsaw. In one word, in the first months of 1756, at the moment when the hostilities between England and France, first opened in America, were on the point of embracing the whole of Europe, Count Broglie had it in his power to form in Poland a confederation which, supported by the subsidies of France, provided by her with arms and munitions, and protected by so many border nations would have altogether withdrawn Poland from the yoke of Russia and restored to that republic laws, government, and power. But France suspended all the help (secours) she had promised, and upset all the measures of her ambassador." <i>(Rulhière</i>, t. I, p. 225.)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The levity with which France abused her influence may be seen — en passant — from the way in which she treated <i>Sweden.</i> First she goaded her into a war with Prussia against Russia (in the Austrian succession war), and then into a war with Russia against Prussia, Sweden being both times the victim of those French intrigues, and Russia gaining both times in that quarter.</p>
<p>Well. What were the consequences of the Seven Years' War which France carried on as the <i>ally of Russia</i> (and Austria) against <i>Prussia</i> (and England)?</p>
<p>That the material resources of Poland were exhausted, that Russia founded her supremacy in Germany, that Prussia was made her slave, that Catherine II became the most powerful sovereign in Europe, and that the <i>first partition of Poland</i> took place. Such were the <i>immediate consequences</i> of the <i>French policy during the Seven Years' War.</i></p>
<p><b>1)</b> During the Seven Years' War the <i>Russian</i> armies treated Poland as their property, took there their winter-quarters etc. I shall quote <i>Favier:</i>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The peril was that Russia, improving the pretext of the war against the king of Prussia, enforced, on the territory of Poland, the passage of her troops, appropriated herself the means of subsistence, and even took her winter-quarters in Poland. By allowing her to employ anew those arbitrary means, that vast country was surrendered to the greediness of the Russian generals, the despotism of their court, and all the projects of future usurpations which Russia would be tempted to form, from the facility of exercising all sorts of vexations against a nation divided, insulated, and abandoned." <i>(Politique de tous les cabinets de l'Europe</i> etc. <i>2nd edit. par L. P. Ségur, Ex-ambassadeur.</i> Paris, 1801, t. 1, p. 300.)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>France discredited herself by giving the Russians such free scope.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That weakness on her part seemed the less pardonable (excusable) because ... she was then in a position to make the law to Russia and Austria, and not at all to receive it from them."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Count Broglie had made in vain proposals to that effect... France allowed Russia to treat Poland like her own property... <i>The Polish nation, from that moment, considered France as a mere instrument in the hands of the courts of Vienna and Petersburg.</i>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"This was the origin of our discredit, of our nullity</i> at the time of the election of Count Poniatowski, and of the bad success of everything we attempted or favoured since that epoch". (303, 304,1. c. <i>Ségur.)</i> ("la nation polonaise ne vit plus dés lors la France que comme un instrument des cours de Vienne et de Pétersbourg. [...] Voilà l'origine de notre discrédit, de notre nullité etc.")
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>France was bound, by the <i>Treaty of Oliva</i> (1660) to protect the Polish Republic.</p>
<p><b>2)</b> During the 7 Years' War the Russians used <i>Poland</i>, although she was ostensibly neutral, as their basis of operations against <i>Prussia.</i> This the Poles <i>allowed under the diplomatic pressure of France.</i> It was thus that the Russians were enabled during 7 years to devastate Prussia proper, Silesia, Pomerania, Brandenburg, and even sack Berlin. They in fact ravaged the Prussian monarchy like wild beasts, while the French acted in the same style in Hanover, Westphalia, Saxony, Thuringia etc. Now, Poland was by the <i>treaty of Wehlau</i> (1660 or so) obliged to defend Prussia, against Russia. Frederick II insisted upon the fulfilment of this treaty. That he was right in asking the Poles to observe at least a complete neutrality, and not allowing the Russians to use their country etc., is proved by the fact that on all the <i>diets</i> kept in Poland since the opening of the Seven Years' War, it was impossible to come to any resolution, because the <i>patriotic party</i> declared, the Poles could not deliberate as long as Russian armies occupied the Polish soil and acted against Prussia. In the last year of the war (1762) the nobility of Posen (Great Poland) had even formed a confederation against the Russians.</p>
<p>If f. i. Belgium allowed Prussia to use it during 7 years, despite its neutrality, as a basis of warlike operations against France, would France not be entitled to treat Belgium as an enemy, and, if she could, to incorporate Belgium, or destroy its independence?</p>
<p><b>3)</b> The immediate upshot of the 7 Years' War was a treaty between Prussia and Russia, by which the king of Prussia professed himself the <i>vassal of Russia, Poniatowski king of Poland</i> but was allowed, in compensation, to share in the <i>partition of Poland.</i> That the latter was already convened upon in the treaty of <i>1764</i> between Russia and Frederick II is shown by the fact that in the same year Frederick II's and Catherine II's ambassadors at Warsaw <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>solemnly <i>protested</i> against that <i>"calumny"</i>, and that a few years later the English resident at Berlin <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>wrote to his court that Austria, although at first protesting, would be compelled by her proper interests to share in the partition of Poland.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Favier</i> says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Our exclusive alliance with the court of Vienna deprived Frederick II of all hope, and reduced him to the necessity of joining that very court which had let loose France upon him, in order to destroy him" <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same <i>Favier</i> avers that the secret of all the future successes of <i>Catherine II</i> and of the first partition of Poland is to be found in the infeodation to her of Prussia. <i>(Frederick II.)</i></p>
<p>Such was the result of the French policy during the 7 Years' War. It cannot be said that England this time prevented her good designs for Poland, because France was then the ally of Russia, while England stood on the other side.
</p>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="ME20-48-4">[3.] First Partition of Poland</h3><a id="[3.]_First_Partition_of_Poland"></a>
<p>Now I must say that even if France had acted more energetically during the Polish war which ended in the first partition of Poland than she really did, it would not have made up for the immense services she had rendered to Russia during the Seven Years' War. The sending of some French officers and subsidies to Poland during the war of the <i>Confederation of Bar</i> could in the best case only prolong a useless resistance. It is true that France incited (1768) Turkey to a war against Russia, but only to betray Turkey as usually, and prepare for her the "treaty of <i>Kudjuk Kainardji"</i> (1774), from which the supremacy of Russia over Turkey must really be dated.</p>
<p><i>1770. Russian Expedition into the Mediterranean.</i> The then almost dying republic of Venice showed much more courage than France. In that year <i>Choiseul</i> still French foreign minister. It was only at the end of 1770 (beginning of 1771) that he was replaced by the <i>Duke d'Aiguillon.</i>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"How," says Favier, "did it happen that, while France was at peace with England, no step was taken for a convention of neutrality for the Mediterranean? Or why did France alone not oppose this Russian enterprise in a quarter so important for her interests?"
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The opinion of Favier is, that
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"the <i>destruction of the Russian fleet in the Mediterranean by the French</i> [which] might have been easily effected, would probably have changed the whole course of events both in Turkey and Poland, and would, moreover, have taught Austria to respect the French Alliance" <i>(Ségur etc. Politique de tous les cabinets etc., v.</i> II, p. 174).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But France who had goaded Turkey into the war against Russia did not move one finger against the Russian expedition of 1770, the only one which was of any import. (The <i>Turkish fleet</i> destroyed in the narrow bay of Tschesmé.) <i>The same Choiseul</i> had English bluster <i>(Chatham</i> himself) not allowed to prevent him a year ago from buying Corsica from the Genoese. You must not forget that at that time <i>North</i> was minister, and could only keep himself in office by keeping the peace at any price. He was one of the most unpopular ministers. At that time revolutionary, anti-dynastic movement in England. It is true that <i>in 1773</i> (the Russians made then a new naval expedition which, however, remained without any influence upon the war with Turkey) the duke of Aiguillon allowed himself to be prevented by the English Ambassador at Paris, Lord <i>Stormont</i>, from attacking the Russian fleet <i>in the Baltic</i> (and Mediterranean). At that time the first partition of Poland was already consummated. The true object of the French demonstration was not Poland, but Sweden, and France so far succeeded, that <i>Gustave III</i> was not forced by Russia to rescind his <i>coup d'état (1772).</i></p>
<p>Moreover, what sort of fellow this d'Aiguillon was?</p>
<p><i>Ségur says</i> in his notes to <i>Favier:</i>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When the rumour got first afloat as to the partition which was to give Prussia an increase of territory which Austria was afraid of, the court of Vienna warned France, and gave her to understand that she would oppose herself, if the court of Versailles would support her. Louis XV, at that time only occupied by his pleasures, and M. d'Aiguillon by his intrigues, the Austrian cabinet received no re-assuring answer and liked better to concur to the partition of Poland than to maintain alone a war against the Prussians and Russians combined." ([t. I], 147 Note.) "Count <i>Mercy —</i> Austrian ambassador — has publicly given out" (répandu dans le public) "that the king of Prussia had communicated to the Austrian minister <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup>the answers of the Duke of Aiguillon, by which that minister assured His Prussian Majesty that France was indifferent to all that could be done in Poland and that she would not consider a <i>casus foederis"</i> (case of war) "anything that might be agreed upon, in regard to that subject, by the courts of Berlin and Vienna" (245, Note).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, although I do not put any confidence whatever in the assurances of the Austrian court, which was then acting with the utmost perfidy, the very fact, that a <i>French ambassador</i> of Louis XVI (Ségur), published this at Paris, shows the estimation Louis XV and his d'Aiguillon enjoyed — and were worth enjoying.
</p>
<h3 class="mw-headline" id="ME20-48-5">[4.] French Republic</h3><a id="[4.]_French_Republic"></a>
<p><i>From September 21, 1792 to November 11, 1799</i> (the day after 19 Brumaire, when the Executive Directory was overthrown). <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>The second partition treaty <i>between</i> Russia and Prussia <i>on 4 January 1793.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup></i></p>
<p>The first crusade against France <i>1792</i> had taken such an unfortunate turn, that already in the beginning of winter the Austrian Netherlands (<i>Belgium)</i> were occupied by the French. Prussia withdrew her troops from the field of action, the condition insisted upon by her <i>on the Congress of Verdun</i> for continuing her participation in the Anti-Jacobin war was that she should be allowed to make with Russia <i>a second partition of Poland.</i> Austria was to be compensated by indemnities in the Alsace.</p>
<p>At the end <i>of 1793 (September)</i> Prussia again withdrew her troops to march them, under the king, <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup>to the Polish frontier (to "secure" his Polish possession), because some differences had broken out, in regard to some definitive stipulations, between Prussia and Russia, the latter seeming to turn against Prussia her influence over the expiring diet of the traitors of Targowicze. The result of this second withdrawal of Prussia, to take real possession of her Polish provinces, forces the Austrians to <i>withdraw from the Alsace.</i></p>
<p><i>In the spring of 1794</i> Kosciuszko's revolutionary rising. Prussia marched at once her troops against Poland. Beaten. In <i>September 1794</i>, while forced to retreat from Warsaw, at the same time rising in Posen. Then the king of Prussia declared his intention to withdraw from the contest carried on against France. Austria also, in the autumn 1794, detached a body of troops for Poland, by which circumstance the success of the French arms on the Rhine and so forth was secured. Already towards the end of 1794 Prussia commenced negotiations with France. Withdrew. Consequence: <i>Holland</i> succumbed to the French (conquest of Holland through Pichegru).</p>
<p>Those diversions facilitated by turns the conquest of Belgium, the success on the Alps, the Pyrenees, the left bank of the Rhine, and, 1795, the conquest of Holland by Pichegru. In the very months October, <i>November</i> (1794) everywhere French successes when Kosciuszko succumbed, Praga was taken by Suvorov etc., immense murdering etc.</p>
<p><i>Third Partition of Poland signed: 24 October 1795.</i></p>
<p>By the outbreak of the French Revolution Catherine got the opportunity quietly first to carry on her war with Turkey, while all Europe was turned to the West.</p>
<p>As the Pope has issued bulls for crusades against the infidels, so Catherine II against the Jacobins. Even while <i>Leopold II</i> chased the <i>French Émigré's</i> from his states and forbade them to assemble on the French frontiers, Catherine, through her agent Rumjanzev, provided them with money and quartered them in the frontier provinces, bordering upon France, and ruled by ecclesiastic princes.</p>
<p>After the conclusion of her war with Turkey, Catherine II did not commence her hostilities against Poland before she had been informed that the National Assembly had <i>declared war to Austria.</i> This news arrived at Vienna on 30 <i>April 1792</i>, and on the 18 <i>May</i> the Russian ambassador Boulgakov <i>presented a declaration of war to the Polish king Stanislaus</i>. <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup>The first in impressing upon England, Austria and Prussia the dangers of the revolutionary principles, Catherine steadily pursued her own separate interests (in Turkey and Poland) without furnishing a single Cossack or subscribing a single rouble for the "common cause".</p>
<p><i>Poland was blotted out under cover of the French Revolution and the Anti-Jacobin war.</i></p>
<p>Rev. <i>L. K. Pitt</i> (a nephew or cousin of the English minister), chaplain to the British factory at St. Petersburg, writes in a <i>secret document: "Account of Russia during the Commencement of the Reign of the Emperor Paul":</i>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"She" (the Czarina) "was not perhaps displeased to see every European power exhausting itself in a struggle, which raised in proportion to its violence her own importance ... the state of the newly acquired provinces in Poland was likewise a point which had considerable influence over the political conduct of the Czarina. The fatal effects resulting from an apprehension of revolt on the late seat of conquest, seem to have been felt in a very great degree by the combined powers who, in the early period of the revolution, were so near re-instating the regular government in France. The same dread of revolt deterred likewise the late Empress of Russia from entering on the great theatre of war."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question is now: How behaved revolutionary France towards this useful ally.</p>
<p>Let us first hear a French historian, <i>Lacretelle</i> (t. XII, p. 261 sqq.)
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Republic", says he, "had shown itself very indifferent to the troubles and misfortunes of Poland. It was on the contrary a great motive of security for it to <i>see the Empress of Russia occupy all the forces of her powerful empire</i> for <i>the conquest and dismemberment of</i> that <i>unfortunate country.</i> Very soon the French Republic became aware that Poland freed it of its most ardent enemy, the king of Prussia etc." <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But republican France actually betrayed Poland.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Polish agent <i>Bars</i> at Paris presented to the government", says <i>Oginski</i>, an eye-witness, "the plan of the revolution which was preparing in Poland, and which was received with a general enthusiasm and approbation. He enumerated the assistance of every kind which would be necessary for that important and daring enterprise. The <i>Comité du Salut Public</i> found his demand very just and promised to do every thing possible; but to promises all the negotiation was limited." <i>(Michel Oginski: Mémoires sur la Pologne etc., from 1788 to the end of 1815. Paris, 1826</i>, t. I, p. 358.)</p>
<p>"The comité of public welfare had promised to general Kosciuszko a sum of 3 millions of livres and some officers of artillery; but we did receive neither one single sou nor one single officer",
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we are told by an aide-de-camp of <i>Kosciuszko, J. Niemcewicz: Notes sur ma captivité à St. Pétersbourg, en 1794-1796. Paris, 1843. (V. p. 90.)</i> <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>On 5 April 1795</i> the directory (which had then replaced the comité du salut public) concluded with Prussia the <i>Peace of Basel.</i> By this peace <i>Holland and the left bank of the Rhine were surrendered to France.</i> The <i>northern part of Germany</i>, designed by a line of demarcation, was <i>neutralised</i>, Prussia to be indemnified by the secularisation of several German bishoprics. That treaty of Basel
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"by <i>guaranteeing the respective possessions</i> of the two contracting powers, and including no clause whatever in regard to the newly invaded provinces of Poland, granted their possession to the king of Prussia". <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" id="cite_ref-18">[18]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Oginski</i> tells us that when the Poles were informed of the peace-negotiations, their agent <i>Bars</i> addressed the members of the directory peculiarly friendly to Poland, and asked for a clause obliging the king of Prussia to renounce etc.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"He was answered that the condition was not acceptable since it would retard the negotiations with Prussia, that France wanted to restore her forces, that the peace with Prussia would not last long, that the Poles should keep themselves ready for new efforts which would be asked from them in the cause of liberty and their country etc."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same <i>Oginski</i>, t. II, p. 133 and 223, tells us:

<p>"The treaty concluded between the French Republic and the king of Prussia had made a very bad impression upon the Divan, which pretended that if France had been unable to obtain anything for Poland in her negotiations with the court of Berlin, it was impossible that the Turcs alone could act in favour of Poland."

<p>After the <i>third division</i> Russia was forced to keep quiet for a few years. The Poles now participated in all the campaigns of the <i>French Republic</i>, principally in Italy. (See: <i>Chodzko: Histoire des Légions Polonaises en Italie, dè 1795 à 1802. Paris, 1829.)</i></p>
<p><i>Before the conclusion of the Peace of Campo-Formio (17 October</i> 1797), after a plan mutually agreed upon, and with the consent of Bonaparte, General <i>Dombrowski</i> was to march through Croatia and Hungary, into Galicia. and thus make a diversion in favour of Bonaparte, who would have marched upon Vienna. <i>Charles de la Croix</i>, minister of foreign affairs (see <i>Oginski</i>, t. II, p. 272-278) proposed to Oginski <i>"to insurge Galicia".</i> Oginski was afraid lest the Poles should be treated as mere tools thrown away after having been used. He therefore demanded a positive assurance that those sacrifices would earn for them French assistance for the recovery of their country. Lacroix played then the irritated bully. The French government did not want them; if they had no confidence, they might try their fortune somewhere else etc. He gave Oginski three days' time for considering, after which they were to accept or [to] refuse, but without putting <i>any conditions</i> whatever. The poor Poles declared ready for whatever the French: government wanted. But that government wanted only their formal acceptance in order to intimidate Austria by it and so to: hasten the conclusion of peace. <i>Armistice at Leoben, 18 April 1797.</i></p>
<p><i>Treaty of Campo-Formio</i> in which the Poles were again sacrificed in the same way as they had been in the <i>treaty of Basel.</i></p>
<p>In 17<i>99</i> at last <i>Suvorov</i>, the effect of the disappearance of Poland made itself felt to the French republic. <i>Russian armies</i> appeared in Holland and in <i>Italy.</i> Suvorov penetrates to the very frontiers of France.</p>
<p>When on <i>27 July 1799</i> <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" id="cite_ref-19">[19]</a></sup>the French surrendered Mantua to the <i>Russian</i> general Vielhorski, there was a <i>secret article</i> in the capitulation by which the Austrians got back their deserters, viz. the Austrian <i>Poles</i> who had entered the legions. After the surrender of Mantua, the 2nd legion fell into the hands of the enemy; the first legion, under Dombrowski, joined the Great Army, and was almost entirely annihilated in the great battles against the Russo-Austrian armies.

<blockquote>

<p>He enrolled a Polish army. The campaign lasted until <i>6 May 1807.</i></p>
<p><i>25 and 26 June 1807.</i> Fraternisation between Napoleon and Alexander on the Niemen.</p>
<p><i>Treaty of Tilsit, signed 7 July 1807</i> (<i>9 July</i> with Prussia).</p>
<p><i>Art. V</i> of that treaty proclaimed the foundation of <i>the duchy of Warsaw</i> which Napoleon cedes
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"in all property</i> and <i>sovereignty</i> to the king of Saxony, <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26" id="cite_ref-26">[26]</a></sup>to be ruled by constitutions, which, while securing the liberties and privileges of the duchy, were compatible with the <i>tranquillity of the neighbouring states".</i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This duchy was cut out of <i>Prussian Poland.</i></p>
<p><i>Art. IX</i> cedes to Russia a part of Poland, the circle of Byalistock, recently conquered from Prussia, and which
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"shall</i> be united in perpetuity to the Russian empire, in order to establish the natural limits between Russia and the duchy of Warsaw". <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27" id="cite_ref-27">[27]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Dantzic</i>, on the pretext of being made a free town, was made a French maritime fortress.</p>
<p><i>Many large estates</i> in the new duchy were made a present of by Napoleon to the French generals.</p>
<p><i>Lelewel</i> calls this justly the <i>Fourth Division of Poland</i>. <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28" id="cite_ref-28">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>Having beaten the Prussians and the Russians by the assistance of the Poles, Napoleon disposed of Poland, as if she was a conquered country and his private property, and he disposed of her to the advantage of Russia.</p>
<p>The duchy of Warsaw was small, without position in Europe. A large civil list; <i>civil</i> government by Saxony, <i>military by</i> Napoleon. <i>Davout</i> ruled like a Pasha at Warsaw. He made in fact of the duchy a recruiting place for France, a military depôt.</p>
<p><i>(Sawaszkiewicz, Tableau de l'influence de la Pologne sur les destinées de la Révolution française. Paris, 1848, 3ème édit.)</i></p>
<p>The duchy of Warsaw was for Napoleon not only an advanced post against Russia. Napoleon had possessed himself of those very points which would serve him as a basis of offensive operations against Prussia and Austria. <i>Nicholas</i> acted in his spirit when he fortified those points by a chain of fortresses.</p>
<p>(By inserting at the head of the <i>treaty of Tilsit</i> the declaration that <i>only out of courtesy for Alexander</i> he restored to the king of Prussia <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29" id="cite_ref-29">[29]</a></sup><i>half of his old territories</i>, Napoleon proclaimed that king, and Prussia, a mere appendage to Russia.)</p>
<p>By the <i>secret articles</i> of the <i>treaty of Tilsit</i> the public ones were partly revoked. Thus f. i. only to deceive Austria, the public treaty contained articles for the <i>integrity of Turkey.</i> By the secret articles Napoleon sacrificed <i>Turkey and Sweden</i> to the Czar who surrendered to him <i>Portugal, Spain, Malta, and the North African coast;</i> promised his accession to the continental system, and the surrender of the Ionian islands to France. The <i>partition of Turkey</i> was only prevented by the opposition of Austria. All the arrangements for a partition of Turkey were beginning after the conclusion of the Tilsit treaty. In <i>August 1808</i> Alexander handed over to Napoleon the strong places of Dalmatia, also the protectorate over the Ionian islands; while the <i>Danubian principalities</i> were occupied by his troops, Napoleon ordered <i>Marmont</i>, the French commander in Dalmatia, to prepare the march upon Albania and Macedonia. The negotiations about the <i>partition of Turkey</i> were continued at Petersburg, whither Napoleon had sent <i>Savary</i>, the head of his gendarmes and mouchards. The <i>Report</i> on his <i>negotiations with Rumjanzev</i>, the Russian foreign minister, has been recently published. Even <i>Thibaudeau</i>, one of Napoleon's senators and admirers, says about the negotiations of Savary with Alexander I and Rumjanzov:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Putting aside every diplomatical form, they transacted their business in the impudent and reckless way of robber-chiefs dividing their booty". <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30" id="cite_ref-30">[30]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the negotiations between Napoleon and Alexander at Tilsit, <i>Sweden</i> and Denmark were to be forced to join the continental system. Napoleon ceded to Alexander <i>Finland</i> (which the Russians occupied in 1808, and have ever kept since), and besides Denmark was interested in the robbery of Sweden by making Norway over to her. Thus Napoleon succeeded in completely breaking <i>down this old antagonist</i> of Russia.</p>
<p><i>27 September 1808. Napoleon and Alexander at the Erfurt Congress.</i></p>
<p>Never before had any man done so much to exalt the Russian power as Napoleon did from <i>1807-1812. From 1808 to 1811 the Poles were consumed by Napoleon in Spain.</i> For the first time in their history they were prostituted as the mercenaries of despotism. Of the army of <i>90,000</i>, formed in the duchy, so many were despatched to Spain, that the duchy was denuded of troops when the Austrian archduke Ferdinand invaded it in <i>1809.</i></p>
<p><i>1809, April.</i> While Napoleon marched upon Vienna, the archduke Ferdinand upon Warsaw. The Poles invade Galicia, force the archduke to withdraw from Warsaw (1 June); the Russians, Napoleon's allies, enter Galicia <i>to assist in fact the Austrians against the Poles.</i></p>
<p><i>14 October 1809:</i> The Polish provinces called by the Austrians <i>"New Galicia"</i>, together with the district of Zamojsk, was reunited to the duchy of Warsaw. Napoleon left to Austria <i>old Galicia</i>, after having separated from it, in <i>order to make it over to Russia</i>, the district of <i>Tarnopol</i>, part of <i>old Podolia.</i> What we have to think of this <i>Fifth Partition</i> (Lelewel) may be seen from a satirical letter of Czar Alexander I to <i>prince Kourakin</i>, published at the time in <i>the gazettes of Petersburg and Moscow</i>, <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31" id="cite_ref-31">[31]</a></sup>d. d. <i>Petersburg 1/13 November 1809.</i> The Czar writes:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The treaty is being ratified between France and Austria, and consequently our hostile movements against the latter cease simultaneously. According to the principles of that peace, Austria remains, as before, our neighbour by her possession of Galicia, and the Polish provinces, instead of being united into one single body, are divided for ever between the three crowns. Thus the dreams of a political revolution in Poland have vanished. The present order of things fixes the limits between Poland and Russia who has not only not suffered any loss in this affair, but on the contrary extends her dominion" (au sein de la Pologne) "in the very heart of Poland." <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32" id="cite_ref-32">[32]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Poles</i> now demanded the restoration of the name of <i>Poland</i> for the duchy. The Czar opposed. On <i>October 20, 1809 Champagny</i>, minister of foreign affairs, addressed a note, by order of Napoleon, to the Russian government, in which it was stated that he approved the <i>effacing [of] the name of Pole and Poland</i>, not only from <i>every public act, but even from history.</i> This was to prepare his proposal — after his divorce with Josephine — for the hand of the Czar's sister. <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33" id="cite_ref-33">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>4 January 1810:</i> Secret convention between Napoleon's ambassador <i>Caulaincourt</i> and count <i>Rumjanzev</i>, to this effect:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"Art. 1.</i> The kingdom of Poland shall never be re-established. <i>Art. 2.</i> The <i>name of Poland and Pole</i> shall never be applied to any of the parties that previously constituted that kingdom, and they shall disappear from every public or official act." Besides "the Grand duchy shall never be aggrandised by the annexation of any of the old Polish provinces; the orders of Polish chivalry shall be abolished and, finally, all these engagements shall be binding on the king of Saxony, Grand Duke of Warsaw, as on Napoleon himself." (<i>Thiers, Consulat et l'Empire, XI</i>, [357, 358].)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was after the negotiations for that convention that Napoleon proposed for the hand of Alexander's sister. Napoleon's irritation and wounded self-love at the hesitation of the Czar (who delayed declaring himself from middle of December to middle of January, under various pretexts), and the repugnance of the Czar's mother, <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34" id="cite_ref-34">[34]</a></sup>made Napoleon look elsewhere for a wife, and break off negotiations.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Emperor Napoleon," says <i>Crétineau-Joly: "Histoire de l'église Romaine en face de la Révolution</i>", "did not allow his policy to lose itself in a phraseology sentimentally revolutionary. With one stroke of the pen his minister effaced, even from history, the <i>name of Poland</i>, and a treaty, which subsequent events rendered null, struck out that name as if it were a geographical superfetation."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After his <i>marriage with</i> the <i>daughter of the Austrian Emperor</i>, <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35" id="cite_ref-35">[35]</a></sup>Napoleon had a new opportunity for the <i>restoration of</i> Poland. I quote from a French author, whose history is an apotheosis of Napoleon. <i>Norvins</i> says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Napoleon was enabled, in 1810, to realise, at last, that noble project", viz. the restoration of Poland, "because Austria offered him both the Galicias, but he refused, in order not to have a war with Russia who prepared war against him the very day after the conclusion of the treaty of Tilsit." <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36" id="cite_ref-36">[36]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After what has preceded, it is almost superfluous to say that Napoleon made his <i>war of 1812</i> against Russia not out of any regard for Poland. He was forced into it by Russia who on <i>19/31 December 1810</i> allowed the import of colonial commodities in neutral ships, prohibited some French commodities, hardly taxed others, and made not the least concession despite all the diplomatic efforts of Napoleon at preventing the war. He must either resign his <i>continental system</i>, or make war against Russia.</p>
<p><i>28 June 1812.</i> Day of entry of Napoleon at Vilna. On that day the existence of <i>confederate Poland</i> (that is Poland united to Lithuania) was proclaimed at the diet of Warsaw, and a <i>national war.</i> Napoleon told the deputies of Warsaw, that he did not want a <i>national war</i>. (<i>Charras</i> tells <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37" id="cite_ref-37">[37]</a></sup>us that by his hatred of such a war etc. 100 days.)

ENGELS TO HERMANN SCHLÜTER
<br>IN HOBOKEN
<br><i>No. 2!!</i>
<br>[London,] 2 December 1893
<br>Dear Schlüter
<br>As regards <i>Census</i> I,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I first got a letter from the General Post Office, Washington, saying that, because of the way it was packed, the book must be paid for <i>as a letter.</i> I must either send $10.36c. for this purpose or let them have the sender's address (I didn't know either what was in it or who had sent it), or else say whether I wanted it <i>sent per express.</i> I asked for further details, at the same time saying they were at liberty to send it <i>per express,</i> which they did, and I got it ON PAYMENT OF 6/-. When sending me things in future, would you be so good as to put <i>your address</i> on the outside in order that delays of this kind may be avoided or dealt with direct over there. I could not quite gather from the Washington General Post Office's letter why they didn't send the thing—whether because of the way it was packed or perhaps because it was inadequately stamped for book-post. Thanks again.
<br>Yours,
<br>F. E.

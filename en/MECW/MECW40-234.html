MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 1 April 1859</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Herewith letter from Lassalle. Herewith letter from Dana, which you must return. I shall wait to hear from you before answering it.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Have written articles on the Reform Bill, MINISTRY.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> My article for next week: <i>Indian Finances.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> All the rest of the world is therefore at your disposal.</p>
<p>So Palmerston, as was decided at Compiègne<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> (but in effect at Petersburg), is to return to the MINISTRY whatever its denomination. Without him Russia could not allow a war. Now, as in 1852 and 1855, Bright and Russell have pulled the chestnuts out of the fire for him.</p>
<p>By the by, the debate in parliament was very funny. The Whigs and Radicals attacked the Tories largely on the grounds of their being REVOLUTIONISTS. Here, Bright's and Gibson's role most abject. (The latter even went so far as to declaim romantically <i>against</i> ELECTORAL DISTRICTS.)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> On the other hand, the farce of Tories, in the name of the MIDDLE CLASS, advocating their own rubbish in opposition to Whigs and MIDDLE CLASS, who advocate theirs in the name of the WORKING CLASS. A sign of great progress in England.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

Dana also requested Marx to write articles on 'Fortification' and 'Infantry' for <i>The New American Cyclopaedia.</i> Both articles were written by Engels (see present edition, Vol. 18).—410</span>

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Besides 'The New British Reform Bill' (see present edition, Vol. 16), Marx wrote two more articles on the 1859 Reform Bill, on 22 March and 1 April 1859, but they were not published in the <i>New-York Daily Tribune</i> and have not reached us.—406, 411</span>

<li id="cite_note-5"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-5">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">On 31 March 1859 the House of Commons rejected, after a second reading, the Reform Bill proposed by the Tory government of Derby-Disraeli, which led to the government's fall. In the preceding debate, on 24 March, Bright and Gibson spoke against the Bill. Gibson quoted Bright, who said in one of his earlier speeches that 'there was no Bill so revolutionary as a bad Bill'. While favouring the preservation of some elements of the obsolete system of 'rotten boroughs', Gibson opposed the new distribution of electoral districts proposed by the government. The ideas expressed in this letter were probably discussed in greater detail in Marx's article on the Reform Bill written on 1 April 1859, which was not published by the <i>New-York Daily Tribune</i> editors.—411</span>

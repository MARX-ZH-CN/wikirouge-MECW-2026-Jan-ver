MARX TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>[London,] 23 May 1872</p>
<p>Dear Sorge,</p>
<p>Just a few lines in great haste.</p>
<p>I am overwhelmed with work. Quite apart from all the International BUSINESS—everything is at sixes and sevens—every day I have to correct the <i>German proofs</i> of the second edition of <i>Capital</i> (which will appear in instalments)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and the <i>épreuves</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> of the French translation<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> in Paris, which I often have to re-write completely to make matters clear to the French. And in addition I also have the <i>épreuves</i> of the <i>ADDRESS ON THE CIVIL WAR</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> which we are bringing out in French in Brussels. You will be receiving a constant flow of instalments in German and French from me.</p>
<p>In Petersburg a splendid Russian translation<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> has appeared.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <i>Russian</i> socialist paper, <i>Die Neue Zeit</i> (its German title, the paper comes out in Russian), recently published a five-column-long leader lavishing praise on the book, which, however, was only meant as an introduction to a series of articles.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> For this, the paper duly received a warning from the police, who threatened to suppress it.</p>
<p>I shall send Liebknecht my answer to the jackasses from the <i>Concordia</i> today.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> I was unable to get round to it sooner. Moreover, it does no harm to leave that factory-owning mob their illusions of victory for a while.</p>
<p>AS TO HEINZEN, I CARE NOT ONE FARTHING FOR THE <i>faits et gestes</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> OF THIS 'democratic numbskull'. He is the true representative of the 'KNOW-NOTHINGS', in the literal sense of the word.</p>
<p>It will do no harm to send me the French translation of the <i>Communist Manifesto.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>I shall tell you in my next letter why the GENERAL COUNCIL is simply abiding by its resolutions<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> for the time being without proceeding in a more aggressive manner. We shall not continue to correspond with those people any more but have only instructed Le Moussu to ask them to return the letters from Eccarius (who has probably already given the <i>ordre</i> to print his letter over there) and Hales.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>(Between ourselves.</i> Eccarius has been demoralised for quite some time now and is now a scoundrel pure and simple—<i>canaille,</i> even.)</p>
<p>In sincere friendship,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

However, its contents and Marx's correspondence on the subject indicate that it was addressed to the heads of the Lachâtre publishing house in Paris. On 13 February 1872 Marx received a reply from the manager Juste Vernouillet, who informed him about the despatch of copies of the agreement on the publication of the French translation of Volume I of <i>Capital.</i> The agreement was signed on 15 February by Marx on one side, and Maurice Lachâtre and Juste Vernouillet on the other. It stipulated that the French edition was to be published in 44 instalments, and sold five instalments at a time.<br>The French authorised edition of Volume I of <i>Capital</i> was published between 17 September 1872 and November 1875. The translation was done by Joseph Roy, who began in February 1872 and completed work in late 1873. The quality of the translation largely failed to satisfy Marx; besides, he was convinced that the original needed to be revised to adapt it to French readers.</span>

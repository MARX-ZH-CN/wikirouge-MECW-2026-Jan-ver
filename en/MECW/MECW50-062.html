<p><i>To Paul Lafargue at Le Perreux</i>
</p>
<h4 class="mw-headline" id="ME50-62-2">London, 25 February 1893</h4><a id="London,_25_February_1893"></a>
<p>My dear Lafargue</p>
<p>How time passes! Old Harney<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> has reminded me this morning that yesterday was the anniversary of the February revolution. 'Long Live the Republic!' Lord, we have so many other anniversaries to celebrate now that one forgets these semi-bourgeois occasions. And to think that in five years it will be a half century since that one took place. At the time we were all enthusiasm for the republic – with a small <i>r</i>; since it has been written with a capital <i>R</i>, it seems worthless, save as an almost obsolete historical stage.</p>
<p>Your speech was very good and I regret only one thing: that it was not delivered two months ago. But better late than never. It doesn't surprise me that the Chamber and the press found it ill-timed; if we were to wait upon their <i>placet</i> we should never open our mouths. As for the Radical Socialists <i>à</i> <i>la</i> Millerand &amp; Co,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> it is absolutely essential that the alliance with them should be based on the fact that our party is a separate party, and that they recognise that. Which in no way rules out joint action in the forthcoming elections, provided that the distribution of seats to be jointly contested is made in accordance with the actual state of the respective forces; those gentlemen are in the habit of claiming the lion's share.</p>
<p>Do not let the fact that your speeches do not create as much stir as formerly discourage you. Look at our people in Germany: they were booed for years on end, and now the 36 dominate the Reichstag. Bebel writes saying: if we were 80 or a hundred (out of 400 members), the Reichstag would become an impossibility. There is not a debate, no matter what the subject, in which we do not intervene and we are listened to by all the parties. The debate on the socialist organisation of the future lasted five days, and Bebel's speech was wanted in <i>three and a half million copies</i>. Now they are having the whole debate published in pamphlets at five sous, and the effect, already tremendous, will be doubled!</p>
<p>You are absolutely right to make preparations for the elections. We ought to capture at least 20 seats. You have the immense advantage of knowing, from the municipal elections,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> the <i>minimum</i> extent of your strength in each locality; for I am sure that, since last May, you have appreciably increased it. That will help you greatly in apportioning candidatures between yourselves and the Radical Socialists. But possibly you would prefer to put up your candidates wherever you stand a chance, with the proviso to withdraw them, if necessary, in favour of the Radicals, for the second ballot, in the event of the latter having polled more votes.</p>
<p>The most important thing in the elections is to establish once and for all that it is our party which represents socialism in France, and that all the other more or less socialist factions – Broussists, Allemanists,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> and pure or impure Blanquists – have been able to play a part beside us only by virtue of the temporary dissensions, incidental to the more or less infantile phase of the proletarian movement; but that now the stage of infantile disorders is over, and the French proletariat has reached full consciousness of its historic role. Should we win 20 seats, all the others combined will not have as many, since they are more likely to lose some than to gain any. In which case things will go forward. In the meantime, <i>nurse your re-election</i>: I have a feeling that your absences from the Chamber have not contributed any too much to ensure it.</p>
<p>Panama is not finished, not by a long chalk.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> And it is a disgrace that the trouble and honour of making disclosures should be left to the Royalists and their dubious allies. They could not have a better battle-cry than 'Down with the robbers', and if the great mass of the <i>stupid</i> countryside takes their part against the Republicans, it is to the cowardice of the <i>Radical</i> Republicans that they will owe this triumph. You say that the republic is not in danger, that the deputies have returned from the recess with this certainty; well, then, they should strike for all they are worth and not let themselves be confused with the robbers by their silence. You are quite right: the political ineptitude of the whole bourgeoisie defies the imagination.</p>
<p>The only country where the bourgeoisie still has a little common sense is England. Here the formation of the Independent Labour Party<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> (though still in embryo) and its conduct in the Lancashire and Yorkshire elections have put a match to the government's backside; it is stirring itself, doing things unheard-of for a Liberal Government.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> The Registration Bill 1) unifies the suffrage for all parliamentary, municipal, etc, elections, 2) adds at least 20 to 30 per cent to the working-class vote, 3) removes the cost of election expenses from the candidates' shoulders and places it on those of the government. The payment of an honorarium to MPs is promised for the next session; and there are also a whole number of juridical and economic measures for the benefit of workers. Finally, the Liberals recognise that, to make sure of governing at the present time, there is nothing for it but to increase the political power of the working class who will naturally kick them out afterwards. The Tories, on the other hand, are behaving at the moment with unbounded stupidity. But once Home Rule is on the Statute Book, they will realise that there is nothing for it but to enter the lists to gain power, and to that end there remains but one means: to win the working-class vote by political or economic concessions; thus Liberals and Conservatives cannot help extending the power of the working class, and hastening the time which will eliminate both the one and the other.</p>
<p>Amongst the workers here, things are going well. They begin to realise their strength more and more, and that there is only one way of using it, namely, by forming an independent party.</p>
<p>At the same time international feeling gains ground. In short, things are going well everywhere.</p>
<p>In Germany the dissolution of the Reichstag is still a possibility; but it becomes less and less likely; everyone, apart from us, is afraid of it. We should win 50 to 60 seats.</p>
<p>On 26 March there will be an international conference at Brussels which is to make preparations for the Zurich Congress. Shall you go to it?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Good riddance to your taenia, and look after your bowels; I was going to make an <i>Irish bull</i> by saying: they are the sinews of war!</p>
<p>Ever yours<br><b>F Engels</b>

<p><i>Cologne,</i> July 7. We have a <i>new ministerial crisis</i>. The <i>Camphausen</i> Ministry <i>fell</i>, the <i>Hansemann</i> Ministry <i>faltered</i>. The <i>Government of Action</i> had a life-span of <i>a week</i> in spite of all the little household remedies, cosmetics, press trials, arrests, in spite of the arrogant impudence with which the bureaucracy once again reared its document-dusty head, hatching petty, brutal plots of vengeance for its dethronement. The " <i>Government of Action</i>", composed entirely of mediocrities, was at the start of the Agreement Assembly's most recent session still so deluded as to believe in its own imperturbability.</p>
<p>By the end of the session it was completely routed. This momentous session convinced Prime Minister von <i>Auerswald</i> that he should tender his resignation; nor did Minister von Schreckenstein want any longer to remain as Hansemann's train-bearer and thus the entire Ministry yesterday betook themselves to the King at Sanssouci. What was decided there we shall learn tomorrow.</p>
<p>Our Berlin # correspondent writes in a postscript:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Just now the rumour is spreading that <i>Vincke</i>, <i>Pinder</i> and <i>Mevissen</i> have been urgently sent for to help in the formation of a new Ministry."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this rumour is confirmed we shall <i>finally</i> have come from the Government of mediation through the Government of Action to the Government of the counter-revolution. <i>At last!</i> The very brief life-span of this ministerial counter-revolution would suffice to show to the people in full life-size these dwarfs who raise their diminutive heads at the slightest stirring of reaction.

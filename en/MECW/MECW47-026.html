ENGELS TO GABRIEL DEVILLE</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>London, 12 August 1883</p>
<p>122 Regent's Park Road, N.W.</p>
<p>Dear Citizen Deville,</p>
<p>I have received your letter and your manuscript, for which I thank you.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Next week I shall be leaving London for a seaside resort.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>There I shall have sufficient leisure to look over your work which will be returned to you as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Your manuscript arrived at an opportune moment. Only yesterday I completed the final editing of the 3rd German edition of <i>Capital,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> and have undertaken to begin editing the 2nd volume immediately on my return from the seaside. So your work reached me precisely at the moment when I happened to have a short interval of time.</p>
<p>I have read the section you sent to Marx a little while ago; it seems to me very clear and very accurate. And, since it comprises the most difficult part of the work, there would appear to be no reason to anticipate any misapprehensions in the remaining sections.</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>F. Engels

On 2 August 1882 he met Marx in Paris where the latter looked through part of his manuscript. On 10 August 1883 Deville wrote to Engels that Paul Lafargue had told him he (Engels) was willing to read the rest of the work. He sent Engels the manuscript with the request that he make the necessary corrections. Deville's book was published that year under the title <i>Le Capital de Karl Marx. Résumé et accompagné d'un aperçu sur le socialisme scientifique.</i> In the Preface the author wrote that he had done the work 'at the courteous request and benevolent encouragement of Karl Marx'. Deville sent Engels a copy with his own dedication. For Engels' assessment of the book see this volume, pp. 61, 76-77.</span>

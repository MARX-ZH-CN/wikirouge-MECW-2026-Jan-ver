MARX TO ADOLPHE HUBERT</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 15 September 1871</p>
<p>My dear Citizen,</p>
<p>Go tomorrow (but you must be there <i>before ten o'clock in the morning)</i> to Mr Fuisse, 35 Richmond Terrace, Clapham Road.</p>
<p>Mr Fuisse is French, former refugee, <i>merchant</i> Yesterday I spoke to him about your business; I told him I should be much obliged if he could help you. In reply, he said that he might be able to facilitate the sale of some of your pictures. To gain entry to Mr Fuisse's house, present the card enclosed herewith.</p>
<p>Fraternal greetings,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

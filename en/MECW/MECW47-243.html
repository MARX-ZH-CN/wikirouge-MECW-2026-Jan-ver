ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT</p>
<p>IN BORSDORF NEAR LEIPZIG</p>
<p>London, 25 February 1886</p>
<p>Dear Liebknecht,</p>
<p>It's really quite impossible to do anything about getting your Russian speech<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>published in this country for, as you know, the <i>big</i> newspapers are barred to us and the monthly <i>Commonweal</i> is too small to take on that sort of thing. You will have to see to the matter yourselves, e. g. by getting in touch with the <i>Standard</i> correspondent as Longuet, for instance, did in Paris with Mother Crawford, the <i>Daily News</i> correspondent. Knowing that the Reichstag has no real say in anything, the British press very rarely mentions it, save for quite short telegrams. If you had not virtually confined yourself to Faerber's view of the harm suffered by German capitalists,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>but had introduced the present eastern imbroglio<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>and blamed it on Bismarck as the man who, because of the loan, has the Russians eating out of his hand, your speech could not have been passed over in complete silence. But what you say about the worthlessness of Russian paper is common knowledge even in this country.</p>
<p>Now as regards those charming German literati who infest the neutral border zone between ourselves and the armchair<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>and state socialists, and want to pocket all the advantages to be derived from our party while carefully shielding themselves against any disadvantage arising out of intercourse with us— I've just had another demonstration of what shits the said literati are. An importunate fellow by the name of Max Quarck — <i>nomen est omen</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>—wrote to me saying that Deville in Paris had given him <i>exclusive rights</i> to translate his abridgment of <i>Capital,</i> and asking me to recommend him to Meissner and write <i>a preface</i> for him.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>It was all a lie, a fact of which I have received confirmation from Paris and as he himself informed Kautsky in a letter the <i>selfsame day.</i> And now the wretch has the effrontery to suggest that <i>I</i> should beg his pardon for <i>his</i> having lied to me! Just let him try that again, the scoundrel.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>You people will find you have competitors in France. The three working men, Basly, Boyer and Camélinat, since joined by Clovis Hugues, have set themselves up in the Chamber as a socialist labour group<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>in opposition to the Radicals,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>and when, at a meeting last Sunday, the Radicals tried to inveigle the constituents into passing a vote of no confidence, they met with a resounding defeat — so much so that at the meeting they themselves had convened, the Radicals did not dare to open their mouths.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>These three French working men will make more of an impact in Europe than your 25 because they sit in a Chamber which, unlike the Reichstag, is not a debating society, and because they have shaken themselves free of the milk-and-water petty-bourgeois following which hangs like a millstone round your necks. Clemenceau is now faced with a last crucial decision, but we can be almost sure that he will not hesitate to join the bourgeois camp, in which case, though he will indeed become a minister, he will be done for.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F.E.

The congress was to work out the German Social Democrats' political line on the social reforms being carried out by the bourgeois government, to decide on the party's tactics and the position to be taken by <i>Der Sozialdemokrat,</i> its printed organ, given the Anti-Socialist Law in Germany (see Note 37). The congress unanimously called on the party to expose the demagogy of Bismarck's domestic policy, endorsed the stance of the main printed organ and the general line of conduct of the parliamentary group (see Note 49). It further made it incumbent on every party member, including the Social-Democratic representatives in the Reichstag, to observe party discipline and help carry out party decisions (see also Note 16).</span>

<li id="cite_note-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-3">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The reference is to the so-called Bulgarian crisis which began in September 1885. In the night of 5-6 September an uprising of Bulgarian patriots occurred in Plovdiv, the capital of Eastern Roumelia (Southern Bulgaria), which, according to the 1878 Treaty of Berlin, was under the control of Turkey (see present edition, Vol. 45, Note 430). The Turkish governor was overthrown. Roumelia was reunited with Bulgaria and Grand Duke (formerly Prince) Alexander Battenberg of Bulgaria proclaimed himself ruler of the united Bulgaria on 8 September. Russia, showing its displeasure at the rapprochement between Battenberg and Austria-Hungary which had begun some time previously, recalled its officers from the Bulgarian army. Reports on this were carried by the <i>Kölnische Leitung,</i> Nos. 276, 277, 278 and 279, 5, 6, 7 and 8 October 1885.<br>On the subsequent course of the Bulgarian crisis, see Engels' article 'The Political Situation in Europe' (present edition, Vol. 26, and also this volume, pp. 512-20 and notes 478 and 634).</span>

The Radicals had their main base in the petty and, to some extent, the middle bourgeoisie and continued to press for a number of bourgeois-democratic demands: a single-chamber parliamentary system, the separation of the Church from the State, the introduction of a system of progressive income taxes, the limitation of the working day and settlement of a number of other social issues. The leader of the Radicals was Clemenceau. The group formed officially as the Republican Party of Radicals and Radical Socialists [<i>Parti républicain radical et radical-socialiste</i>] in 1901.</span>

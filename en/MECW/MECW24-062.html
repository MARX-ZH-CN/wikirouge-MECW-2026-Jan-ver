<p>London, March 16, 1883</p>
<p>Karl Marx's death occurred at 3 o'clock in the afternoon of Wednesday, the 14th inst, at Argen teuil, France. For several weeks Marx had been suffering from bronchitis, this being further complicated by an abscess of the lung, and ultimately an internal haemorrhage put an end to his life. His death was an easy and painless one.</p>

ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Waterloo near Liverpool, 29 July<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>(Wednesday) 1857</p>
<p>Dear Marx,</p>
<p>Here I am at last at the seaside, where I have been since the evening of the day before yesterday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>It's 3 miles beyond New Brighton, but to the north of the Mersey. Unfortunately I arrived with a raging cold which has temporarily aggravated the glandular trouble, caused me a great deal of pain and spoilt my sleep. The worst of it is that for a day or two I shall be pretty well incapable of work, my daily report for Heckscher and other such unavoidable notes being as much as I can manage. In the evening I'm in such intense pain and so enervated that up till now I haven't even been able to read. That this damned thing should have had to happen now! Thus, since Friday evening or Saturday morning all my time has been wasted first by interruptions, then</p>
<p>by my illness. I'm one of your really miserable figures, stooped, lame and weak and—e.g. as at present—beside myself with pain.</p>
<p>I had a hamper of wine sent to you from Manchester which will do your wife good: 6 bottles of Bordeaux, 3 of port, 3 of sherry. It should be there by now if the thing was properly attended to. Let me know the colour of the seals on the port and sherry so that I can keep a check on my wine merchant. Sherry ought to be <i>yellow,</i> port, I think, green. The Bordeaux bears the label Co. Destournel; I have just imported it.</p>
<p>You will have the <i>militaria</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>as soon as at all possible. Unfortunately I don't know whether the post reaches London in 1 day; I shall only discover that from experience within the next few days.</p>
<p>I hope that the sea air will soon make me fit again for the usual drudgery. As things are now, I'm bored to death.</p>
<p>Warmest regards to your wife and daughters.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p>You'll have received the <i>£5</i> note.</p>
<p>Address: F. E., care of Mr Swingwood, Bath St., Waterloo near Liverpool

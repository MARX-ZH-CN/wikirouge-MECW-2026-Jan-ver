<p>TO F. WALTER IN LONDON<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>London, 21 December 1888</p>
<p>Mr F. Walter 47 Marshall Street, Golden Sq., W</p>
<p>Dear Mr Walter,</p>
<p>The first time you wrote to me I knew nothing about you and hence could take no more account of your letter than of the many others on a similar subject which I receive from strangers.</p>
<p>You now refer to Most from which I must conclude that you belong to the anarchists. But as long as the weight of the anarchists' attack is directed at our embattled party in Germany rather than at the common enemy, my resources will be devoted to the victims of persecution at the hands of the German governments, and it cannot be expected of me that I should support people who maintain a hostile stance towards my friends and party comrades in Germany and elsewhere.</p>
<p>In no circumstances would I be capable of getting the broker out of your house.</p>
<p>If, however, I should be mistaken about your political affiliations, you will have no difficulty in establishing your bona fides with my old friend Lessner, 12 Fitzroy St, in which case I shall be happy to do something for a <i>genuine</i> member of the party, although the settlement of a debt such as yours would be far beyond my means.</p>
<p>Yours very truly
</p>

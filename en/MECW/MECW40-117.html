<p>Dear Lassalle,</p>
<p>Of the various letters you mention I have received only one, that sent via Freiligrath. I didn't answer, or rather was awaiting a private occasion for answering which, for reasons that cannot very well be committed to paper, did not present itself. I would point out, by the by, that it was you who <i>first</i> broke off the correspondence by failing for such a long time to answer a letter dated Manchester [8 Nov 1855].</p>
<p><b>My thanks for</b> <i>Heraclitus</i>. I have always felt a great <b>tenderness</b> for this philosopher, whom I prefer above all the Ancients save Aristotle. [Later] philosophy — Epicurus (him in particular), Stoa and Scepticism — [I] had made the object of <i>special</i> study, but for [political] rather than philosophical [...] reasons. While [tendering] my thanks, [I] must at the same time [say] that the work has not yet reached me.</p>
<p>Doubtless [Nutt's] will send it as soon as it comes into their [...] to write [... Mi]nistry. My views on Palmerston you know, and these have not changed. Besides, I know nothing whatever about the paper since Austrian journals are nowhere on display here, and am thus quite ignorant of its general line. Whatever the case, I should be interested to see one or two numbers.</p>
<p>I live in great isolation here, all my friends except Freiligrath having left London. Anyway, I have no desire for intercourse. <i>Relativement parlant</i>, Freiligrath is doing quite well as <b>manager</b> of the Swiss Bank and is still the same good-natured, sterling fellow he has always been. Lupus and Engels are in Manchester as before. We still lament the loss of Weerth.</p>
<p>The present commercial crisis has impelled me to set to work seriously on my outlines [<i>Grundrisse</i>] of political economy, and also to prepare something on the present crisis. I am forced to fritter away [...] my days earning a living. [Only] the nights remain free for real work and that is disrupted by ill-health. I [have] not yet looked round for a publisher as I know from experience the [...] come of it [...] when I cannot send you any news, living as I do like a hermit. Throughout last winter and summer my wife was very unwell, but has now recovered in some measure.</p>
<p>If you know Dr Elsner's address please send him my regards.</p>
<p>That old ass Ruge has, I am told, made an attempt to resuscitate his <i>Deutsche Jahrbücher</i>. History will not put the clock back far enough to make this feasible.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.

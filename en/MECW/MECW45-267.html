MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Ramsgate,] 28 August 1879</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>The enclosed letter from Master Most, forwarded by Tussy,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>has just arrived. You must let me know by return what sort of answer you consider suitable. What Most wants is obviously something which he for his part might 'misuse'; on the other hand what Mr Lübeck does is inspired by Mr Bernstein.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>A beautiful morning today; whether the weather will hold for the rest of the day is another matter.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Moor</p>
<p>PLEASE RETURN THE MOST LETTER. Yesterday evening, after the rain had stopped, we took Johnny<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>down to the beach. Some people said: 'That little boy looks like a prince.' Johnny turned fiercely round and retorted: 'I look like a little Jollymeyer!'</p>
<p>From a letter received from the house Lafargue I see that the other Meyer—not the Jollymeyer—had another scene at Lafargues. Poor fellow!

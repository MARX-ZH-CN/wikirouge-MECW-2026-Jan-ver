MARX TO FERDINAND LASSALLE</p>
<p>IN DÜSSELDORF</p>
<p>London, 6 April 1854 (You know the address)</p>
<p>Dear Lassalle,</p>
<p>Your letter of 7 March safely received. I should like to make a few comments, firstly on your military, and secondly on your diplomatic, VIEWS.</p>
<p><i>ad</i> <i>1</i>. To my comment<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> regarding Enos and Rodosto, you reply—agreeing in this with the English ministerial papers—that Constantinople must be protected.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> If the two fleets in the Black Sea and the Army of the Danube cannot protect it, then neither can 100,000 French and English. I do not, of course, deny that, if they are to be launched against Sevastopol or Odessa, they are closer to hand at Rodosto than in Malta or Toulon.</p>
<p>The notion that a move into Serbia would place the Austrians 'in the rear of the Turkish Army of the Danube' does not seem to me quite correct. The Austrians must make their crossing at Belgrade or not very far below it, or else enter Wallachia via <i>Mehadia</i> along the <i>left</i> bank of the Danube. In the first case they would find themselves in the <i>extension</i> of the Turkish left wing, in the second to the <i>front</i> of it. That this would mean the immediate sacrifice of Kalafat and Vidin, with the exception of the garrison which would remain there, is evident—but not that this Turkish left wing would be lost and its remnants compelled to fall back on the Shumla line. <i>Au</i> <i>contraire</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> , the correct tactics for the Austrians would be to march immediately on Sofia via Nissa, hence the correct tactics for the Turks would be to withdraw from Vidin, <i>likewise</i> to Sofia. Not having so far to go, they would be there <i>before</i> the Austrians and could either make a stand in the Balkans or withdraw towards Adrianople.</p>
<p>Should the Austrians allow themselves to be enticed into marching on Vidin, the Turks would still make for Sofia. This division of Omer Pasha's principal corps would not involve the fragmentation of his forces, since the new enemy would necessitate a new Adrianople-Sofia-Belgrade-Vidin operational line. Thus the Turkish left wing would become an <i>independent</i> army.</p>
<p>Should the strategy you postulate be adopted in spite of all this, no amount of falling back on the Shumla line would avail, for the latter, having <i>already</i> <i>been</i> <i>outflanked</i> as a result of the sacrifice of <i>the</i> <i>highway</i> from Belgrade to Constantinople, would have to be abandoned all the more precipitately in order to assemble <i>all</i> <i>available</i> <i>reserves</i> <i>at</i> <i>Adrianople</i> and advance against the first enemy to pass through the Balkans.</p>
<p><i>ad</i> <i>2</i>. <i>Ad</i> <i>vocem</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> <i>Palmerston</i>. Your view of Palmerston is the one prevailing on the Continent and among the liberal majority of the English public.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> As for myself, I am of the unalterable opinion that Palmerston—<i>en</i> <i>passant</i> Princess Lieven paid his debts for him in 1827, Prince Lieven got him into the FOREIGN OFFICE in 1830 and Canning, on his deathbed, told people to beware of him—is a <i>Russian</i> <i>agent</i>. I came to this conclusion after the most conscientious and painstaking scrutiny of the whole of his career and, indeed, of the 'Blue Books', the 'Parliamentary Debates' and the pronouncements of his own diplomatic agents.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> Though far from amusing and very time-consuming to boot, the work has proved rewarding in so far as it provides the key to the secret diplomatic history of the past 30 years.—(<i>En</i> <i>passant</i>. Some of my <i>Tribune</i> articles on Palmerston have again been reprinted in London as separate pamphlets in 50,000 copies.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> )</p>
<p>Palmerston is no genius, a genius would not lend himself to such a role. But he is a most talented man and a consummate tactician. His artistry does not lie in serving Russia, but rather in contriving to maintain the role of a 'TRULY ENGLISH MINISTER' while so engaged. The only difference between him and Aberdeen is that Aberdeen serves Russia because he doesn't understand her, while Palmerston serves her although he does. Hence the first is Russia's avowed partisan, the second her secret agent, the first gratis, the second in return for fees received. Even if he himself now wished to do so, he could not turn <i>against</i> Russia because he is at her mercy and must live in constant fear of being immolated in Petersburg. This is the man who in 1829 condemned Aberdeen's policy as not pro-Russian enough,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> who was told by Robert Peel in the House of Commons<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> that he didn't know whose representative he was, who sacrificed the Poles in 1831, who imposed the Treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi on the Porte in 1833,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> who abandoned the Caucasus and the Danube estuary to Russia in 1836, who engineered the treaties of 1840 and 1841<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> and a new Holy Alliance against France, who conducted the Afghan War in the Russian interest,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> who, in 1831, 1836 and 1840, paved the way for the incorporation of Cracow, only to protest against it in 1846, etc.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> No matter what he engaged in, he worked against his country's commercial interests on the pretext of protecting them. E.g., in the matter of Neapolitan sulphur.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup> He frustrated advantageous trade agreements which were about to be ratified with France. This is the man who delivered up Italy and Hungary.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup> Had he merely worked against revolutionary peoples, it would have been understandable. But in questions involving exclusively British interests, he invariably contrived in <i>the</i> <i>most</i> <i>subtle</i> manner to betray these to Russia. Incidentally, people here are beginning to understand him. Looking forward to hearing from you soon,</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

On Palmerston Lassalle wrote in particular: 'True, Palmerston never deserved—not by a long shot—the totally usurped reputation which he enjoys, and has lately been even more primitive than before; but neither is he a Russian agent, at least not consciously. His attitude I can best describe to you in the words he said to a friend of his as early as December: Je veux la Russie, je ne dis pas ruiner, mais lui donner un soufflet pour toute sa vie! [I want—I don't say to destroy Russia—but to give it a slap in the face that it would remember for ever!] 'It is a fact that he pressed for war from December, etc., and answered every objection that Russia could not concede this or that with "Tant mieux!" ["All the better!"]' (F. Lassalle. Nachgelassene Briefe und Schriften herausgegeben von Gustav Mayer. Band III. Der Briefwechsel zwischen Lassalle und Marx. Stuttgart-Berlin, 1922, S. 73)</span>

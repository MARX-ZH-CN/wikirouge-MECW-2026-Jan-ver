ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN
<br>IN ZURICH
<br>London, 6 January 1882
<br>Dear Mr Bernstein,
<br>I am writing to you in haste today in order to shed some light on the peculiar expressions that occur in the last number of the <i>Égalité</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> on the subject of the <i>Sozialdemokrat.</i> The point is that, out of the goodness of his heart, Guesde engaged for the German section of the paper a person known to be the mortal enemy of everything appertaining to 'Zurich',<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and the said person was unable to refrain from thus expressing his displeasure that the <i>Sozialdemokrat</i> should survive and not the <i>Laterne.</i> You would oblige us and serve the cause by taking no notice of this. If it happens again, we shall at once put a stop to it. By contrast, we were delighted that the <i>Sozialdemokrat</i> should not have hesitated to accuse the deputies of downright cowardice, thus bringing matters to a head, something which many of them, had Bebel not been there, would doubtless have sooner avoided.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <br>The <i>Egalité</i> people, by the way, have been luckier than, <i>au fond,</i> they deserved. Malon and Brousse made horrible fools of themselves in connection with Joffrin's candidature by putting forward a watered-down programme — in defiance of the congressional resolution passed at Rheims,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> and quite simply suppressed one of the points discussed there, just because it happened not to suit their book (<i>Egalité,</i> No. 4, p. 7, Paris). In this way they put the <i>Egalité</i> in the right which, in the circumstances and on tactical grounds, was absolutely imperative — not Guesde and Co., but Malon and Co., were the real <i>autoritaires</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> the strivers after dictatorship.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> And, now that the struggle has come out into the open, I need hardly say that our sympathies lie wholly with Guesde and his friends. Moreover, the <i>Egalité</i> is, and always has been, infinitely superior to the <i>Prolétaire</i> as far as content is concerned. Malon and Brousse are again behaving like true Bakuninists: they accuse others of hankering for dictatorship and, under pretence of maintaining their 'autonomy', want to rule the roost themselves without regard for party resolutions.
<br>Marx is at Ventnor in the Isle of Wight, but writes to say that the weather is atrocious, worse than here. Well, it will soon change, no doubt; at all events, there would now seem to be no real danger of a relapse. The haste the bourgeois press was in to disseminate the news of his confidently anticipated demise did him no end of good: 'Now I must live to a ripe old age, if only to spite the damned rascals.'
<br>Kautsky will have to be patient for a few more days. Schorlemmer is still here, which means that the most that I can do is dabble in natural science; on top of that, there's all the coming and going which won't be over until next week. Then, when time's no object, as Schorlemmer says Darmstadt-fashion, I'll write to him about the Poles.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> <br>Kindest regards to him and you,
<br>from yours
<br>F. Engels

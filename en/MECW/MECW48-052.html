ENGELS TO JOHN LINCOLN MAHON<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Eastbourne, 26 July 1887<br>
4 Cavendish Place</p>
<p>Dear Mr Mahon,</p>
<p>Your postcard with address was forwarded to me here, hence the delay.</p>
<p>If your letter means anything, it means that you intend, as far as you can, to shove Aveling entirely out of the movement.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> If you decline to work along with Aveling on <i>public</i> grounds, you are bound to come out with them, so as either to enable Aveling to clear himself or to free the movement from a dangerous and false co-operator. If not, then you are bound, in my opinion, to set aside your personal feelings in the interest of the movement.</p>
<p>Of all the various Socialist groups in England, what is now the 'oppo- sition' in the League,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> was the only one with which so far I could thor- oughly sympathise. But if that group is allowed to fall to pieces from mere personal whims and squabbles, or from mutual suspicions and insinuations which are carefully kept away from the light of day, it can only dissolve into a number of small cliques held together by personal motives, and utterly unfit to take any sort of lead in a really national movement. And I do not see on what grounds I should sympathise with</p>
<p>any of these cliques more than with another, or with the Social Democratic Federation<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> or any other body.</p>
<p>I have no right to ask you why you refuse to co-operate with Aveling. But as you have worked with him for years,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> <i>he</i> has, and therefore I consider myself bound to communicate your letter to him.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>F. Engels

<li id="cite_note-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-3">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The Socialist League was founded in December 1884 by a group of English socialists who had withdrawn from the Social Democratic Federation (see note 62). The League's organisers included Eleanor Marx Aveling, Ernest Belfort Bax and William Morris. 'The Manifesto of the Socialist League' (see The Commonweal No.1, February 1885) stated that its members advocated 'the principles of Revolutionary International Socialism' and sought 'a change in the basis of Society ... which would destroy the distinctions of classes and nationalities'. The tasks of the League included the formation of a national socialist party, the conquest of political power through the election of socialists to local government bodies, and the promotion of the trade union and co-operative movement. In the League's early years its leaderook an active part in the working-class movement. However, in 1887 the League split into three factions (Anarchist elements, 'parliamentarists and 'anti-parliamentarists'). With sectarian tendencies growing stronger, the League gradually distanced itself from the day-to-day struggle of the British workers and finally disintegrated in 1889-90.</span>

<li id="cite_note-4"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-4">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The Social Democratic Federation was a British socialist organisation, the successor of the Democratic Federation, reformed in August 1884. It consisted of heterogeneous socialist elements, mostly intellectuals, but also politically active workers. The programme of the Federation provided for the collectivisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange. Its leader, Henry Hyndman, was dictatorial and arbitrary, and his supporters among the Federation's leaders denied the need to work among the trade unions. In contrast to Hyndman, the Federation members grouped round Eleanor Marx-Aveling, Edward Aveling, William Morris and Tom Mann sought close ties with the mass working-class movement. In December 1884, differences on questions of tactics and international co-operation led to a split in the Federation and the establishment of the independent socialist league (see note 21). In 1885-86 the Federation's branches were active in the movement of the unemployed, in strike struggles and in the campaign for the eight-hour day.</span>

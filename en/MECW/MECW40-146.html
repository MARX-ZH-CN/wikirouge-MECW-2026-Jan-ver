ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>Manchester, 1 March 1858
<br>Dear Marx,
<br>On Wednesday, 24 February, I sent you a registered letter containing R/J 56641, Manchester, 16 Jan. 1857; a five-pound note. I trust that it reached you. If not, STOP PAYMENT at the Bank IMMEDIATELY. This evening I shall also send DIVERSE <i>Guardians;</i> another batch went off last Wednesday at the same time as the letter. In today's you'll find some interesting stuff about Orsini.
<br>The shabby way in which Pam, as he made his exit, unleashed all manner of political persecution—first Bernard and Allsop and now that poor devil of a PUBLISHER<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> —was quite a lark. But even this hasn't put John Bull off his TRULY BRITISH MINISTER,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> just a little grumbling here and there about the 2 <i>cives Romani</i> in Naples.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> VERILY, the fellow has left an offensive stench behind him.
<br>In today's <i>Guardian</i> you will see that in Preston, etc., etc., SHORT TIME is still the order of the day. Will soon be general again. At present prices MANUFACTURERS are losing on most things, while spinners are just able to subsist, and to subsist well in the case of a few articles. As soon as rising prices CHECK demand (hitherto the fear of <i>still</i> higher prices has momentarily increased it), that too will cease and the fun begin all over again.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Truly British Minister—an allusion to Lord Russell's description of Palmerston  as a champion of British interests in his House of Commons speech of 20 June  1850, in which he sought to justify Palmerston's military and diplomatic moves  against Greece in connection with the burning in Athens in 1847 of the house of  the merchant Pacifico, a Portuguese Jew and British subject. Lord Russell argued  that Palmerston was motivated by the need to uphold the prestige of British  citizens. The actual aim of Palmerston's moves was to make Greece surrender  several strategic islands in the Aegean.—107, 116, 276, 431</span>

<li id="cite_note-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-3">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">By<i> '2 cives romani</i> [Roman citizens]' Engels means the British Prime Minister  Palmerston and Napoleon III. (He alludes here to the Latin expression 'civis  Romanus sum'—'I am a Roman citizen' cited by Palmerston in his speech in  the House of Commons on 25 June 1850.) Engels has in mind in particular their  intention to send an English and a French squadron to the shores of Naples at the  end of 1856 under the pretext of bringing pressure to bear on the reactionary  regime there (see Note 103), and their repressive measures against democrats in  France and Britain after Orsini's attempt on the life of Napoleon III.—  276</span>

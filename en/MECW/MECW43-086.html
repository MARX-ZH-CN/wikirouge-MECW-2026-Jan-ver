ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 6 October 1868</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Enclosed Lessner's letter and bill and five pounds. I shall see to it that at least <i>this</i> bill will be paid off bit by bit.</p>
<p>I have scarcely been able to have a look at the other things, for I was so horribly busy today. Tomorrow I shall send you back the letters.</p>
<p>Best greetings to your wife and the girls, including Lafargue.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.
</p>

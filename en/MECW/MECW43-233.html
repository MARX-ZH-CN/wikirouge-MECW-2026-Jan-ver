ENGELS TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN
<br>IN HANOVER
<br>Manchester, 28 July 1869
<br>Dear Kugelmann,
<br>Enclosed the biography suitably adapted for <i>Zukunft,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and drawing attention to the <i>18th Brumaire.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I would be grateful if you had it copied there, since it would be better for Weiss <i>not</i> to know it is by me.
<br>Marx will be writing to you, or will have already written, about the journey. You certainly will not get him to go to Karlsbad,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> and as far as I am concerned, the business with the final accounts, etc. is dragging on so much that I have no idea <i>when</i> I shall be able to get away; it's as good as certain that this will <i>not</i> be before 15-20 August. It's very unpleasant, but since this is the last time that COMMERCE will burden me so, I should not grumble too much. This means that I shall scarcely get to see you this year, as I shall hardly get as far afield as Karlsbad.
<br>In order to get the biography off today I must close now—so until next time, and let Karlsbad do some good to your gall-stones.
<br>One of my sisters-in-law in Barmen also had some once, but she is happily rid of them, and once again round, fat and jolly.
<br>Yours
<br>F. E.

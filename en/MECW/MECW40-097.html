<p><i>To Engels in Ryde</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 23 September [1857]</b></p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Very many thanks for the letter and enclosure.</p>
<p>I would, of course, very much like to see you before you leave. <i>If at all feasible</i> I shall come down to Brighton. The trouble is that the end of the quarter brings an accumulation of all the <b>difficulties</b> one has been staving off throughout the summer. The main thing — and the only way out of my quandary — is to get on quickly with the <i>Cyclopedia</i>. The coming of autumn also means redeeming this and that from the pawnshops.</p>
<p>I hope to have done with the biographies (all of them) by next week. (Is there anything to be said about that jackass, <i>Sir G. Brown</i>?)</p>
<p>I have begun a <b>series</b> in the <i>Tribune</i> on the Bonaparte régime's deeds of financial derring-do. To this I devote the days when there is no Indian news. I should like also to have a personal discussion with you about India, <b>map in hand</b>. Up till now I have always managed instinctively to hit the nail on the head. But soon it will be time for me to provide a kind of <i>general military summary</i> of the affair.</p>
<p>A few days ago, on my way to the Museum, I came such a purler that my forehead is still complaining.</p>
<p>I trust you are taking iron. A day or two ago I was talking to Dr Lichtenberg at the German hospital, a very knowledgeable little chap. He said that it was indispensable in after-treatment.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.

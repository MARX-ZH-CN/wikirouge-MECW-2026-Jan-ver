<br><i>To Engels in Ryde</i>
<br><b>[London,] 23 September [1857]</b>
<br>Dear Engels,
<br>Very many thanks for the letter and enclosure.
<br>I would, of course, very much like to see you before you leave. <em>If at all feasible</em> I shall come down to Brighton. The trouble is that the end of the quarter brings an accumulation of all the <b>difficulties</b> one has been staving off throughout the summer. The main thing — and the only way out of my quandary — is to get on quickly with the <em>Cyclopedia</em>. The coming of autumn also means redeeming this and that from the pawnshops.
<br>I hope to have done with the biographies (all of them) by next week. (Is there anything to be said about that jackass, <em>Sir G. Brown</em>?)
<br>I have begun a <b>series</b> in the <em>Tribune</em> on the Bonaparte régime's deeds of financial derring-do. To this I devote the days when there is no Indian news. I should like also to have a personal discussion with you about India, <b>map in hand</b>. Up till now I have always managed instinctively to hit the nail on the head. But soon it will be time for me to provide a kind of <em>general military summary</em> of the affair.
<br>A few days ago, on my way to the Museum, I came such a purler that my forehead is still complaining.
<br>I trust you are taking iron. A day or two ago I was talking to Dr Lichtenberg at the German hospital, a very knowledgeable little chap. He said that it was indispensable in after-treatment.
<br>Your<br>K. M.

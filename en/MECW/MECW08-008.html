<blockquote>
<p>Marx wrote "Cavaignac and the June Revolution" as an editorial introduction to a series of articles published under the tide "Herr Cavaignac" in the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> No. 142 (second edition), No. 145 (special supplement), No. 146, No. 147 (second edition), No. 157 (supplement) and No. 158, November 14, 17, 18 and 19, December 1 and 2, 1848. These articles were reprinted (with certain changes) from the newspaper <i>La Presse </i>where they were published from November 7 to 11, 1848, under the general title: "M. Cavaignac devant la Commission d'Enquête sur l'insurrection du 23 Juin", their author being smile Girardin, editor of the newspaper, republican and later follower of Bonaparte.

</blockquote>
<p><em>E. Girardin</em> is pitiable in his apologia for the imperialistic cretin <em>Louis Napoleon</em>, the "<em>little constable</em>" <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> ; he is likeable in his attacks on <em>Cavaignac</em>, the warrior hero of M. Marrast. Since November 7 he has been publishing in consecutive issues a philippic against the <em>hero of the European bourgeoisie</em>, which has fallen in love with his Arabian nightcap. <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Perfidious as this bourgeoisie is, it has sacrificed him to the <em>Sipehsalar</em> [supreme commander] <em>Jellachich,</em> who is now the <em>lion</em> of the European hucksters.</p>
<p>We give our readers in full the <em>acte d'accusation</em> made by <em>La Presse.</em> In contrast to all European newspapers of great or small format, we have conceived the <em>June revolution</em> in a way that history has confirmed. We insist on coming back from time to time to its chief factors and chief <em>dramatis personae</em>, since the <em>June revolution is the centre</em> around which the European revolution and counter-revolution revolve. The distance from the June revolution, as we stated at the time when it was taking place, marked the zenith of counter-revolution, which had to make its tour of Europe. The return to the June revolution is the real beginning of the European revolution. Therefore, back to <em>Cavaignac</em>, to the <em>inventor of the state of siege.</em>

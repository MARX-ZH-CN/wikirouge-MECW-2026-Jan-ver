<blockquote>
<p>Marx wrote "Cavaignac and the June Revolution" as an editorial introduction to a series of articles published under the tide "Herr Cavaignac" in the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> No. 142 (second edition), No. 145 (special supplement), No. 146, No. 147 (second edition), No. 157 (supplement) and No. 158, November 14, 17, 18 and 19, December 1 and 2, 1848. These articles were reprinted (with certain changes) from the newspaper <i>La Presse </i>where they were published from November 7 to 11, 1848, under the general title: "M. Cavaignac devant la Commission d'Enquête sur l'insurrection du 23 Juin", their author being smile Girardin, editor of the newspaper, republican and later follower of Bonaparte.

<p><i>E. Girardin</i> is pitiable in his apologia for the imperialistic cretin <i>Louis Napoleon</i>, the "<i>little constable</i>";<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> he is likeable in his attacks on <i>Cavaignac</i>, the warrior hero of M. Marrast. Since November 7 he has been publishing in consecutive issues a philippic against the <i>hero of the European bourgeoisie</i>, which has fallen in love with his Arabian nightcap.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Perfidious as this bourgeoisie is, it has sacrificed him to the <i>Sipehsalar</i> [supreme commander] <i>Jellachich,</i> who is now the <i>lion</i> of the European hucksters.</p>
<p>We give our readers in full the <i>acte d'accusation</i> made by <i>La Presse.</i> In contrast to all European newspapers of great or small format, we have conceived the <i>June revolution</i> in a way that history has confirmed. We insist on coming back from time to time to its chief factors and chief <i>dramatis personae</i>, since the <i>June revolution is the centre</i> around which the European revolution and counter-revolution revolve. The distance from the June revolution, as we stated at the time when it was taking place, marked the zenith of counter-revolution, which had to make its tour of Europe. The return to the June revolution is the real beginning of the European revolution. Therefore, back to <i>Cavaignac</i>, to the <i>inventor of the state of siege.</i>

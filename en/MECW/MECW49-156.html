ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE
<br>AT LE PERREUX
<br>London, 1 December 1891
<br>My dear Laura,
<br>Your letter of the 28th, postmark Le Perreux 30th, arrived today and took an awful weight off my mind.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I have at once sent a translation to Bebel and authorized him to use it whenever necessary.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>Fortunately the stupidity of our enemies in Germany has been so colossal that they have, so far at least, seemingly overlooked the whole affair. What I was most afraid of, was that they should raise a storm in Germany before we had been able to ascertain the facts and to be armed with the materials for a crushing reply. Hesitation on the part of the German leaders, or random assertions that might be contradicted, would have been equally dangerous. Now the first danger is over, and although it is quite on the cards that the German Embassy in Paris may have sent reports which in consequence of the usual bureaucratic delays get into the press a week too late, we have a strong position and can meet the charge if it should come.
<br>Still for that purpose it would be important to have Ranc's article. If it was possible to <i>broder</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> such stuff upon it, it must form a peculiar canvas, and not only the false report of Paul's speech,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> but also Ranc's words may be quoted; and we ought to know what they are. Paul merely wrote, Ranc had written in his favour with regard to Bordeaux 1870. Could you procure us the number, and if not, at least say what paper it appeared in, that we may try to hunt it up here?
<br>Now as to other matters.
<br>1) Some time ago I sent you 10s. for account of Sorge for the <i>Socialiste;</i> please say whether you have received it, you know how particular old Sorge is.
<br>2) Have you received the copy of 4th edition <i>Ursprung der Familie</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> I sent rather more than 3 weeks ago? I sent a lot of copies to the Continent and not one has been acknowledged. As the English Post simply confiscates book-post matter for abroad if a half-penny is short on the postage, I begin to feel rather anxious.
<br>3) Tussy is bothered to death by Greenwood, the secretary of the glass-workers who has sent a lot of money for the French glass-workers on strike and cannot get a single acknowledgment of receipt. He says in a letter to Tussy November 28th that he has sent to Paul same day £49 for that purpose — will you please do your best to get Paul to acknowledge all sums sent through him and also to get Pierre Morrier of Lyons who has had several sums, to do the same? The Castleford Glass Bottle Makers have behaved very well to their French comrades, and the least these latter can do is to acknowledge receipt, so as to enable the senders to <i>account</i> for the money to their constituents. Unless this simple act is complied with, it will be doubtful whether the English Trades Unions will not get tired of supporting Continental strikes, and certainly nobody could blame them.
<br>Bebel's speech on the budget was very good.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> As soon as I get a pretty full report I shall send it you.
<br>Last night a letter from Sam Moore; had arrived at Lagos in the Niger delta, and would be back in the arms of his black wife in about a week or ten days.
<br>Yours ever,
<br>F. Engels

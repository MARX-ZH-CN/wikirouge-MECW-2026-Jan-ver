<p><i>To Johann Philipp Becker in Geneva</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 31 August 1866</b></p>
<p>Dear Becker,</p>
<p>It is absolutely imperative that <i>Jung</i> be made President of the congress,</p>
<p>1. because he speaks the 3 languages, English, French, and German.</p>
<p>2. Jung <i>truly represents</i> the <b>Central Council</b>, Odger (who furthermore only knows his mother-tongue) was <i>not</i> elected by the <b>Central Council</b>; we elected 4 delegates, with Jung at the head; Odger was only to go if he could raise the money himself (guaranteed by us, of course). He has done <i>nothing</i> for the Association.</p>
<p>3. Cremer and Odger have hatched a very mean plot to prevent Jung and Eccarius leaving on the very last day.</p>
<p>4. <i>Odger</i> wishes to be elected <i>President of the congress</i> as a means of impressing the English and imposing himself as President of the <b>Central Council</b> for next year, against the <i>wish of the great majority of the</i> <b>Council</b><i>.</i></p>
<p>5. Cremer and Odger have both <i>betrayed us</i> in the Reform League, where they came to a <i>compromise with the bourgeoisie</i> against our wishes.</p>
<p>6. Mr Cremer has <i>morally debased</i> himself completely. All his efforts are now aimed at securing a '<i>paid' post</i> for himself, so that he need not work. <i>In no circumstances must</i> he therefore be elected <i>as General Secretary</i> by the congress. (The only paid post.) They must elect Fox, on the pretext, which is incidentally true, that the General Secretary must know <i>more than one language.</i></p>
<p>9. The <i>President of the</i> <b>Central Council</b> must not be elected by <i>the</i> congress but here <i>in London,</i> as a figure of <i>merely local importance.</i></p>
<p>10. At the election of the <i>President for the congress, you</i> must say at the outset that an <i>international congress</i> can only be presided over by a man who can speak the various languages, simply to save time, etc.</p>
<p>11. Convey this to Dupleix.</p>
<p>12. I should be glad if you would get Eccarius to translate the instructions which I wrote in the name of the <b>Central Committee</b> for the London delegates into German beforehand.</p>
<p>Regards and handshake.</p>
<p>Your<br>Karl Marx

<br><i>To Johann Philipp Becker in Geneva</i>
<br><b>[London,] 31 August 1866</b>
<br>Dear Becker,
<br>It is absolutely imperative that <em>Jung</em> be made President of the congress,
<br>1. because he speaks the 3 languages, English, French, and German.
<br>2. Jung <em>truly represents</em> the <b>Central Council</b>, Odger (who furthermore only knows his mother-tongue) was <em>not</em> elected by the <b>Central Council</b>; we elected 4 delegates, with Jung at the head; Odger was only to go if he could raise the money himself (guaranteed by us, of course). He has done <em>nothing</em> for the Association.
<br>3. Cremer and Odger have hatched a very mean plot to prevent Jung and Eccarius leaving on the very last day.
<br>4. <em>Odger</em> wishes to be elected <em>President of the congress</em> as a means of impressing the English and imposing himself as President of the <b>Central Council</b> for next year, against the <em>wish of the great majority of the</em> <b>Council</b><em>.</em>
<br>5. Cremer and Odger have both <em>betrayed us</em> in the Reform League, where they came to a <em>compromise with the bourgeoisie</em> against our wishes.
<br>6. Mr Cremer has <em>morally debased</em> himself completely. All his efforts are now aimed at securing a '<em>paid' post</em> for himself, so that he need not work. <em>In no circumstances must</em> he therefore be elected <em>as General Secretary</em> by the congress. (The only paid post.) They must elect Fox, on the pretext, which is incidentally true, that the General Secretary must know <em>more than one language.</em>
<br>9. The <em>President of the</em> <b>Central Council</b> must not be elected by <em>the</em> congress but here <em>in London,</em> as a figure of <em>merely local importance.</em>
<br>10. At the election of the <em>President for the congress, you</em> must say at the outset that an <em>international congress</em> can only be presided over by a man who can speak the various languages, simply to save time, etc.
<br>11. Convey this to Dupleix.
<br>12. I should be glad if you would get Eccarius to translate the instructions which I wrote in the name of the <b>Central Committee</b> for the London delegates into German beforehand.
<br>Regards and handshake.
<br>Your<br>Karl Marx

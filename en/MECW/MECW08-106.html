<p><em>Cologne,</em> February 16. A few days ago we offered condolences to the leading article of the <em>Kölnische Zeitung</em> signed D which saw in the elections to the Second Chamber (see No. 33 of the <em>Kölnische Zeitung</em>) the defeat of the "<em>great Centre"</em> of the German nation and discerned two Chambers, one of which would not yet be constitutional, the other not yet monarchical.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Storms will blow from opposite poles, a dead past will fight against a distant, perhaps never attainable future."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what will become of the "<em>Centre</em> of the German nation"? Thus wailed <em>Schwanbeck.</em></p>
<p><em>Brüggemann</em>, of the three stars, is storming from the "opposite pole" against his friend in today's issue of the same <em>Kölnische Zeitung</em>.</p>
<p><em>No Centre,</em> says the man of the "legal basis", the merry gentleman who, with solemn pedantry, invariably raises the <em>status quo</em> to an immortal <em>principle</em>; <em>no Centre</em>, that is the joke of it. No Centre, that is <em>,no cowardice, no indecision, no hollow ambition</em>! No Centre, that is the doctrine of it! The Centre will in future dissolve into a "<em>true</em>" Left and a "<em>true</em>" Right! That is the true meaning of it.</p>
<p>Thus Brüggemann, the "true" man of "<em>true</em>" decision.</p>
<p>In other words: Brüggemann shifts from <em>the Centre</em> to <em>the Right:</em> the "parliamentary correspondence" has brought him to parleying. We tremble for the Right.</p>
<p>But let the melancholy D, dying of too much thinking in the night, argue with the merry three stars. <em>Ça ne nous regards pas!</em> [That does not concern us]

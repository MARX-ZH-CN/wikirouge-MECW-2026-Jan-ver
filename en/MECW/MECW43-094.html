MARX TO HERMANN JUNG</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 19 October 1868</p>
<p>Dear Jung,</p>
<p>As long as there is no scandal that could implicate the International. You can be insulting if your heart demands so. But no fisticuffs.</p>
<p>The best thing would be to give the appearance of bringing a suit against the fellows (Besson and Le Lubez) for LIBEL because of the letter.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> This joke could be fixed up with Merriman. You would see how the COWARDS would grovel, besides they would face the danger of being examined publicly in court about their fine gang.</p>
<p>Yours</p>
<p>K. M.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Alexandre Besson and Victor Le Lubez (see Note 72) had sent a letter TO HERMANN JUNG in October 1868 in which they protested against the decision of the Brussels Congress to expel Pierre Vésinier from the International (see Note 156). In their letter they also attacked Hermann Jung and Eugène Dupont, members of the General Council. On 19 October 1868, Jung informed Marx about the French Section's meeting at which he was going to defend the International.</span>

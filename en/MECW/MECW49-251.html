ENGELS TO HERMANN ENGELS</p>
<p>IN ENGELSKIRCHEN</p>
<p>Ryde, 8 August 1892<br>
The Firs, Brading Road</p>
<p>Dear Hermann,</p>
<p>After all the preparations and letter writing, my trip has finally fall- en through. The old trouble with my groin, which originally began when I came down with my horse while out fox hunting and which became bothersome ten years ago but lay dormant during the latter five, has suddenly sprung to life again. The bandages are no longer of any use and after walking about 2 English miles = 3 kilometres last Saturday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I was pretty well incapable of going any further. I know what to do. For the next month I must take a complete rest and ab- stain from beer and wine, after which all will be well, but travelling is out of the question. I wrote yesterday to Rudolf<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> in Barmen,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> but am sending this note to Engelskrichen today in case you are still there.</p>
<p>I'm terribly sorry that things should have turned out in this way. But it can't be helped and I must resign myself. So I shall be staying here (address overleaf) until the end of August.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Time for the post. Much love to you all. In haste.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Friedrich

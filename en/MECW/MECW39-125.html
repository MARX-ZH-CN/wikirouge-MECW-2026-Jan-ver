MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>London, 16 November 1852 28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>If you can, do a <i>Tribune</i> article on the Cologne affair<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>for Friday. You are now as familiar with all the material as myself and, for the past 4-5 weeks I have so neglected my domestic pother for the sake of PUBLIC BUSINESS that, with the best will in the world, I shall not be able to get down to work this week.</p>
<p>You haven't told me whether you received the Reichenbach circular<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>sent off to you last week.</p>
<p>This evening we are to discuss a statement for the English Press on the Cologne affair.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>There will hardly be time to send it for you to see beforehand. However, if you could do one to reach me by <i>Thursday</i> <i>morning</i>, that would be even better.</p>
<p>Regards to Weerth.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>At the Ruge meeting<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>on the 9th, messages were received from Kossuth-Mazzini pleading sickness. However, on the 10th they put in an appearance at the 'Friends of Italy'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>Ledru did not make his excuses at all.

This common ownership shall also apply to all future fixed assets of the spouses by the future spouses hereby declaring all fixed assets which they will inherit in the future, or which will later fall to the lot of one or other of them, to be movable property, and putting these future fixed assets, which they give wholly into common ownership, on a par with movable property, whereby in accordance with Article fifteen hundred and five of the Civil Code their transformation into movable assets (:<i>ameublissement</i>:) takes place.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>. Each spouse shall for his or her own part pay the debts he or she has made or contracted, inherited or otherwise incurred before marriage; in consequence whereof these debts shall be excluded from the common ownership of property.</p>

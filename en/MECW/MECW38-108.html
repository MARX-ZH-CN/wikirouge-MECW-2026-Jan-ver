<p>TO LOUIS BAUER IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Rough copy]</p>
<p>[London,] 5 February [1850]<br>
20 Queen's Road</p>
<p>I am <i>only now</i> answering your letter of 30 January because I am not inclined to let you prescribe 'time limits' for what I do.</p>
<p>In reply to your letter the following:
</p>
<ol><li>When Schramm wrote that my debt to you was not yet 'due', it only meant that one cannot be sued for a SURGEON'S bills until six months have elapsed, certainly not that the debt does not exist.</li>
<li>Far from having conceded to Mr Heidemann that your bill was not 'too steep', I told him the contrary, as he himself admitted on 22 January in the letter to my wife. <i>Nevertheless</i> I informed him that I was willing to pay. As I told him, I hoped that by January I should be in possession of the necessary amount although I could not guarantee this. The impertinence of Mr Heidemann in sending a woman a demand for payment under a <i>black seal</i>, which she mistook for the announcement of a death, moved me to have him informed in writing that I wished to have no further contact with him.</li>
<li>As to your bill, I <i>now</i> insist that you <i>itemize</i> it. I fail to understand how you could have disbursed £1 on my behalf. You travelled out to me in Chelsea at my express request on only three occasions, once by cab. As to the confinement,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <i>accoucheurs</i> over here (except in the case of the bourgeois) charge for 9 <i>days—while you</i> attended my wife on only 4 days out of the 9, as Willich can testify—one GUINEA. Where, then, do you get £4.10 from? By the way, I am told that, immediately upon receipt of <a href="MECW38-101.html">my letter</a>, you held a confabulation with Heidemann and decided 'to fleece' me. So first of all an itemized bill, which I shall then pay.</li></ol>
<p>K. Marx

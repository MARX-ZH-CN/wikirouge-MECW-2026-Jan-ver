ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN
<br>IN ZURICH
<br>London, 2 February 1881
<br>Dear Mr Bernstein,
<br>Enclosed a letter to Kautsky,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> which kindly forward; I don't know whether the Vienna address I was given is still the right one.
<br>The 5 nos. of the <i>Sozialdemokrat</i> since the year began testify to a significant step forward. Gone are the melancholy, despairing tones of a 'beaten man', the complementary grandiloquence of stuffy respectability, the incessant revolutionary rhetoric <i>à la</i> Most alternating with philistine tameness, finally the constant preoccupation with Most. The tone has become lively and purposeful. The paper will no longer act as an opiate if it stays like this; rather it will put new heart into our people in Germany. As you have the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> you would do well to take a look at it occasionally. The mockery and contempt with which we treated our opponents were precisely what brought us in almost 6,000 subscribers in the 6 months prior to the state of siege<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and, although we started again from scratch in November, we again had the full tally and more by May '49. The <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i> has now admitted that in those days it <i>only had 9,000.</i>
<br>As it seems that you are short of material for your feuilleton, you might, sometime, reprint the poem from No. 44 of 1848: 'This morning I went to Düsseldorf; possibly with the title 'A Socialist-Eater of 1848' (feuilleton to the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> of 14 July 1848) and, under it, the author: Georg Weerth (died Havana, 1856).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> So just keep it up!
<br>Yours,
<br>F. E.
<br>'Thou shalt not steal' and the apology for the execution of Louis XVI are very good.

Marx's letter to Bracke was first published by Engels, together with the <i>Critique of the Gotha Programme,</i> in 1891 in <i>Die Neue Zeit,</i> Vol. 1, No. 18. An excerpt from this letter was published in English for the first time in <i>The Socialist Series,</i> number one, under the title 'The Socialist Programme. By Karl Marx', The Socialist Labour Press, Glasgow [1918]. It appeared in English in full in: K. Marx and F. Engels, <i>Selected Works.</i> In two volumes, Moscow-Leningrad, 1936.</span>

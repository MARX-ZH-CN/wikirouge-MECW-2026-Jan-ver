MARX TO MAX OPPENHEIM</p>
<p>IN PRAGUE</p>
<p>London, 17 October 1874</p>
<p>1 Maitland Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Mr Oppenheim,</p>
<p>A few days ago I posted off one <i>Capital</i> and one <i>18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte</i> for you and one copy of each of these books for Dr Gans jun. Would you be so kind as to send his copies on to him; he lives in Rosengasse, No. 17, 1st floor, Prague.</p>
<p>When I took my departure from Karlsbad, I did so with the intention of proceeding directly to Hamburg in order to settle my business with the bookseller<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> there and then to return to London as soon as possible to resume my work. I soon discovered, however, that the <i>after-treatment</i> following the strict regime of Karlsbad is not to be taken lightly and so had to spend almost another two weeks romping around Dresden, Leipzig, Berlin and Hamburg. Had I foreseen this—and my daughter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and I both regret our mistake—I would have first come to see you in Prague.</p>
<p><i>Mais l'homme propose et le chemin de fer dispose!</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>I hope that your health has improved and that your business may one day soon bring you in this direction.</p>
<p>My daughter sends you her best regards.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>K. Marx

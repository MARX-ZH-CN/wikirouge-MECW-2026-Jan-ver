ENGELS TO MARX<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] Friday morning [5 June 1857]</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Instead of coming to see you I am once more condemned to no less than four days of hot poultices. My face is again very bad and the whole business has begun all over again. But this time I intend to get rid of it for good. This will, of course, postpone my departure for Manchester <i>ad infinitum.</i> If the thing clears up quickly I might be able to go out for a bit on Monday.</p>
<p>In case you have any news for me in the meantime, drop me a line. The address you know: 7 Grove Hill, Camberwell.</p>
<p>I am RATHER annoyed by this business, as you can imagine, but <i>que faire</i>?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Warm regards to your wife and children.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">On coming to London in early June 1857, Engels had a relapse of the ailment about which he wrote to Marx on 20 May (this volume, pp. 130-31). He probably stayed with his brother-in-law Emil Blank, husband of his sister Marie. Engels gives only 'Friday morning' as the date of this letter. In earlier editions it was dated 12 June 1857. But since it was written in early June and not later than 10 June (as can be seen from the fact that Marx wrote the draft of his letter to Collet on the back of this letter not later than 10 June—see Note 174), and moreover on a Friday, the letter can only have been written on 5 June.</span>

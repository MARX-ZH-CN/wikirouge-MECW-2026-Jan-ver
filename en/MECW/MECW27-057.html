<p>A REMINISCENCE OF THE YEAR 1848<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
</center><p>At that time Karl Marx met in Vienna <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> the Prague booksellerm Borrosch, the leader of the German-Bohemian group in the Austrian National Assembly.</p>
<p>Borrosch complained a great deal about the national strife in Bohemia, and the alleged fanatical enmity of the Czechs towards the Bohemian Germans. Marx asked him how things were with the Bohemian workers. "Yes," replied Borrosch, "that is quite a different matter; as soon as the workers join the movement, that comes to an end ; there is no more talk of Czechs or Germans, they all stand together."</p>
<p>What the Bohemian workers of both nationalities only <i>sensed</i> [at that time] they now <i>know</i>: that all national strife is only possible under the rule of the big landed feudal lords and capitalists; that it serves solely to perpetuate this rule; that Czech and German workers have the same common interests and that as soon as the working class attains political power all causes for national strife will be removed. For the working class is international by its very nature, and it will demonstrate this once again on the coming First of May.</p>

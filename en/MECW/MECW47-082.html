ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN AND KARL KAUTSKY</p>
<p>IN ZURICH</p>
<p>London, 22 May 1884</p>
<p>My Dear Fellows,</p>
<p>Herewith the ms.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>with the exception of the final chapter which still needs revising. You will find that it is not suitable for the <i>open</i> market in Germany, so consider whether it ought to be printed in Stuttgart under a false style or then and there in Zurich, and let me know in writing. Since the Prussian schnapps affair,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup><i>everything bearing my name has been banned.</i> If it goes to Stuttgart I shouldn't want it to be revealed beforehand to the Wise Men who hold sway there.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>In any case I must read the <i>proof</i> myself and would ask you for the sheets <i>in duplicate,</i> on good paper with a wide margin, otherwise one cannot make proper corrections. Perhaps you would be good enough to send a postcard acknowledging receipt. I shall answer your letters tonight or tomorrow; I have put everything on one side in order to get the enclosed finished and must presently set off for the funeral of Pumps' little boy who died on Sunday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Your old friend</p>
<p>F.E.

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Engels' work 'Prussian Schnapps in the German Reichstag' (see present edition, Vol. 24) was written in February 1876. The publication of this work, which exposed the Prussian Junkers, in <i>Der Volksstaat</i> and as a separate offprint caused consternation in government quarters.</span>

<li id="cite_note-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-3">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Here Engels is apparently referring to several representatives of the Right wing in the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany such as Bruno Geiser, editor of the Stuttgart-based <i>Die Neue Welt,</i> and to journalists who were close to this trend, like Karl Frohme, Wilhelm Bios, Louis Viereck, etc.</span>
</li>
<li id="cite_note-4"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-4">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">In his letter of 17 March 1883, Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis, on behalf of the Dutch Socialist Workers' Party, asked Engels to 'pass on our homage and grateful acknowledgement, to the Marx family and to all those who join us in mourning at the grave of the master'. Nieuwenhuis also informed Engels that he planned to translate his work <i>Socialism: Utopian and Scientific</i> into Dutch, which he actually did in 1886. Nieuwenhuis further enquired about Engels' plan with regard to Volume II of Marx's <i>Capital,</i> further study of the English labour movement after 1845 and the reissue of Engels' <i>The Condition of the Working-Class in England.</i></span>

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>Ramsgate, 30 August 1870</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning back to London by STEAMER. In the first place, it is very expensive to pay for 5 people to stay here since the English have thronged to all the seaside resorts on account of the war.</p>
<p>In the second place, RELATIVELY to the price the accommodation is damned 'draughty'. The worst pains have stopped, but I am<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>almost paralysed in a certain place, so that I must consult the doctor yet again.</p>
<p>More details from London.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p><i>The Spectator</i>—8 DAYS SINCE—said that your articles<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>were the only significant ones in the English press, but regretted that the AUTHOR WAS SO CHARY OF HIS WORDS AND HIS FACTS. <i>Apropos.</i> Borkheim was here yesterday on a visit from Margate. He seemed put out because <i>he</i> wanted to write <i>your</i> articles, and had approached the <i>Pall Mall</i> before us. He took his leave with a long face.

In these articles, written in the form of military surveys, Engels analysed the events of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 from the angle of historical materialism. With the exception of the first three articles, signed 'Z', they were published unsigned.</span>

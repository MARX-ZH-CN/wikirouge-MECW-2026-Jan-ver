<br>Dear Friend,
<br>A happy New Year and best thanks for your kind letter.
<br>You must excuse the brevity of these lines on account of my being excessively busy at present. I'll write more fully next time. I am enclosing two cards and will let you know in my next letter which questions are to be dealt with at the public congress in Geneva at the end of May.
<br>Our Association has made great progress. It already has 3 official organs, one in London, <em>The Workman's Advocate,</em> one in Brussels, <em>La Tribune du Peuple,</em> one put out by the French section in Switzerland, <em>Journal de 1'Association Internationale des Travailleurs, Section de la Suisse Romande</em> (Geneva), and in a few days time a journal is to be put out by the German-Swiss section, <em>Der Vorbote,</em> under the editorship of <em>J. P. Becker.</em> (Address: 6 rue du Môle, Genf, J. P. Becker, in case you wanted to send him an occasional article, political or social).
<br>We have succeeded in attracting into the movement the only really big workers' organisation, the English '<b>trade unions',</b> which previously concerned themselves <em>exclusively</em> with the wage question. With their help, the English society we founded to achieve <b>universal suffrage</b> (half of its Central Committee consists of members — working men — of our Central Committee) held a giant <b>meeting</b> a few weeks ago, at which only working men spoke. You can tell what effect it had from the fact that the <b>leaders</b> of two successive issues of <em>The Times</em> were concerned with this <b>meeting</b>.
<br>As regards my work, [Capital] I am now busy 12 hours a day writing out the fair copy. I am thinking of taking the manuscript of the first volume to Hamburg myself in March and using the opportunity to see you.
<br>I was much amused by the antics of Justus von Möser's successor. How wretched a man of talent must be who seeks and finds satisfaction in trivialities of that kind!
<br>As regards Bürgers, he is doubtless well-meaning, but weak. It is not much over a year ago that he declared at a public <b>meeting</b> in Cologne (it appeared in print in the Cologne papers) that Schulze-Delitzsch had 'solved' the social question once and for all and that only <em>personal friendship for me</em> had induced him (Bürgers) to stray onto the tangled paths of communism! After such public <em>statements,</em> could I regard him as other than a 'renegade'?
<br>Your most sincere friend<br>K. Marx

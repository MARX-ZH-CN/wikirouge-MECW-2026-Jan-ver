MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 4 November 1868</p>
<p>DEAR FRED, On Friday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I have to pay the water rates and, further, Tussy's re-subscriptions with Winterbottom (gymnastics), etc. I would be grateful if you could send me SOME £ by the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>How are things with the Russian's manuscript?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Have a look at it and then let me have your opinion. The poor fellow is certainly waiting anxiously for my reply.</p>
<p>Pyat has had a stroke of good luck. He has now got hold of <i>his own</i> German—Herr Weber<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> from the Palatinate.</p>
<p>In all haste.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>Enclosed letters from Eichhoff.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> He believes Schweitzer has denounced him here. NOTHING OF THE SORT. His denouncer (which he should not know) is <i>Borkheim.</i> In order to get rid of him ON THIS POINT and, at the same time, to elucidate the suspicion that could, in fact, be aroused by Eichhoff's reference to Bismarck (in his speech reported in Wilhelm's <i>Wochenblatt),</i> I have written to Eichhoff<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> that he has been denounced to the General Council here and should send me his DEFENCE.

Among the reasons that had led to this suspicion was an inaccurate report of Eichhoff's speech at the first meeting of the Berlin Democratic Labour Union (see Note 207) on 15 October 1868 published by<i> Die  Zukunft</i> and later by the<i> Demokratisches Wochenblatt,</i> No. 43, 24 October 1868.</span>

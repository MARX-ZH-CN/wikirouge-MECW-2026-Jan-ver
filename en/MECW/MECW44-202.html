<p>Beginning of March 1872</p>
<p>Sorge is very naive to demand a book on Ireland written from <i>our</i> standpoint. For the last two years I have been intending to write one, but the war, the Commune and the International have brought everything to a standstill. Meanwhile I recommend the following books to Sorge:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. <i>The Cromwellian Settlement of Ireland</i> by Prendergast. London, Longmans, Sec. Ed. 1870-71.</p>
<p>2. <i>Memoir on Ireland</i> by O'Connell. London — Duffy, 1869.</p>
<p>For the main historical events</p>
<p>3. <i>The Irish People and the Irish Land</i> by Isaac Butt. London-Ridgway.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is all for the present.</p>
<p>However simple the Irish problem may be, it is nevertheless the result of a long historical struggle and hence has to be studied. A manual explaining it all in about two hours does not exist.

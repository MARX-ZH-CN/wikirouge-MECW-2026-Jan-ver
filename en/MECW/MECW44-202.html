<br>Beginning of March 1872
<br>Sorge is very naive to demand a book on Ireland written from <em>our</em> standpoint. For the last two years I have been intending to write one, but the war, the Commune and the International have brought everything to a standstill. Meanwhile I recommend the following books to Sorge:

<blockquote>
<br>1. <em>The Cromwellian Settlement of Ireland</em> by Prendergast. London, Longmans, Sec. Ed. 1870-71.
<br>2. <em>Memoir on Ireland</em> by O'Connell. London — Duffy, 1869.
<br>For the main historical events
<br>3. <em>The Irish People and the Irish Land</em> by Isaac Butt. London-Ridgway.

</blockquote>
<br>This is all for the present.
<br>However simple the Irish problem may be, it is nevertheless the result of a long historical struggle and hence has to be studied. A manual explaining it all in about two hours does not exist.

ENGELS TO RICHARD STEGEMANN</p>
<p>IN TÜBINGEN</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London,] 26 March 1885</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I hardly imagine that I would be capable of acceding to your request.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> You might, it is true, be able to produce a fairly clear portrait of Marx the man from all the activities, both literary and political, Marx engaged in; information on these activities is of course freely available to the world at large, with the single exception of Germany, most of the requisite material having appeared abroad. On the other hand, a character sketch by me would necessarily be brief, hence not only inadequate but<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> dogmatic and likewise 'belletristic', hence worse than nothing at all. Besides I cannot presume that my assessment should be taken by you for gospel, and so could not tell what would ultimately become of my contribution, even having regard to your indisputable bona fides. If, however, you proceed on the assumption that Marx was the exact opposite of the German philistine in every conceivable respect, you can't go far wrong.</p>
<p>Whether this is now the precise moment for a critique of Marx, what with the 2nd book of <i>Capital</i> due to appear in a month or two and with work proceeding on the 3rd, is for you to decide. At all events you are right in saying that criticism and so-called 'scholarship' have disclosed nothing hitherto save a 'general lack of judgment', and no one was more amused by that than Marx himself. I can still see him laughing over the despairing sighs of Mr Schäffle who had studied <i>Capital</i> for ten years and still hadn't understood it.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> </p>

Stegemann requested Engels, in the absence of printed sources for a biography of Marx, to send him his own thoughts about Marx as a man.</span>

<p><b>Dear Fred</b>,</p>
<p>Would you please study the enclosed document... <em>seriously,</em> despite its <em>fadaise</em>. [absurdity] <em>Your marginal notes</em> should be written for me in <em>French,</em> and the stuff itself <em>returned to me at the latest by</em> <b>Saturday next</b>.</p>
<p><em>Mr Bakunin —</em> in the background of this business — is condescending enough to wish to take the workers' movement under <em>Russian</em> leadership.</p>
<p>This shit has been in existence for 2 months. Only this evening did <b>Old</b> Becker inform the General Council about it in writing. This time Nincompoop is right. As <b>Old</b> Becker writes, this association should make up for the deficient '<em>idealism</em>' of our Association. <em>L'idéalisme Russe!</em></p>
<p>There was great anger about the document this evening at the meeting of our <em>Conseil Général,</em> particularly among the French. I had known about the shit for a long time. I regarded it as stillborn, and out of consideration for <b>Old</b> Becker, wanted to let it die a quiet death.</p>
<p>But the business has become more serious than I expected. And consideration for <b>Old</b> Becker is no longer admissible. This evening the <b>Council</b> decided to repudiate this <b>interloping society</b> publicly — in Paris, New York, Germany and Switzerland. I have been commissioned with drafting the decree of repudiation (for next Tuesday). I regret the whole thing, because of <b>Old</b> Becker. Mais our Association cannot commit <b>suicide</b> because of <b>Old</b> Becker.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.</p>
<p>Strohn writes to me from Düsseldorf that his brother Eugen has died suddenly in Hamburg.</p>
<p>About the <b>cotton bankruptcies</b> in Manchester, etc., can you send me <em>The Guardian?</em>

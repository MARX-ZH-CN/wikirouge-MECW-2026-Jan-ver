ENGELS TO PASQUALE MARTIGNETTI
<br>IN BENEVENTO
<br>London, 12 March 1886
<br>Dear Citizen,
<br>Please excuse the belated reply. I have received your kind letter of 8 February and the manuscript,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> which I shall deal with as soon as possible. But at the moment I am obliged before anything else to check through the English translation of <i>Capital,</i> Volume I, which is most pressing and must be printed without delay; it is no easy task. When I have a free moment I shall devote it to your work.
<br>I have also received, and I thank you for them, the 6 copies of the <i>Origin etc.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>I am sorry that my error 'Paolo' caused you inconvenience.
<br>I shall not repeat it.
<br>I must get hold of the calendar in order to restore the passage that was stuck and illegible; I hope to find it here in London at a friend's house; this is another cause of delay.
<br>I am sorry I cannot do better and more quickly than this, but the English <i>Capital</i> must take precedence; in any case I am committed by a deadline to the publisher.
<br>With respect I remain
<br>F. Engels
<br>I hope to spare some time in April on <i>Wage Labour and Capital.</i>

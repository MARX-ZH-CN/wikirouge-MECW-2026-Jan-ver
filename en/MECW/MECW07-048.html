<blockquote>
<p>An article published in <i>The Northern Star</i> No. 557, June 24, 1848, under the title "The New Rhenish Gazette" stated: "<i>New Rheinische Zeitung</i> is the title of a new daily journal lately started at Cologne. This journal, which announces itself 'the organ of the democracy', is conducted with singular ability and extraordinary boldness; and we hail it as a worthy, able, and valiant comrade in the grand crusade against tyranny and injustice in every shape and form. The principal editor is Dr. <i>Marx</i> one of the ablest of the defenders of Labour's rights in Europe. The assistant editors include W. Wolff, of Breslaw, a sterling democrat: Dr. Dronke, of Coblentz, ex-state prisoner; F. Wolff, of Cologne (was ten years in Paris); H. Bürgers (of Cologne, a favourite popular orator, and member of the first Popular assembly at Frankfort); Frederick Engels, whose able writings have often graced the columns of the <i>Star </i>and George Weerth, a name honourably known to our readers as the unmasker of the Freetrade delusionists at the celebrated Brussels Conference. We wish our contemporary a long career of usefulness and victory."

</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Northern Star</i>, the organ of the English Chartists, which is edited by Feargus O'Connor, G. Julian <i>Harney</i> and Ernest <i>Jones</i>, contains in its latest issue an appreciation of the manner in which the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> interprets the English people's movement and advocates democracy in general.</p>
<p>We thank the editors of the <i>Northern Star</i> for the friendly and genuinely democratic way in which they have mentioned our newspaper. At the same time we want to assure them that the revolutionary <i>Northern Star</i> is the only English newspaper for whose appreciation we care.

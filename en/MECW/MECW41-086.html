ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>[Manchester, after 28 June 1860] 
<br>Dear Moor,
<br>Encl. an article on the RIFLE parade<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> ; the subject occurred to me just when I was about to despair. Go over it thoroughly; I haven't the time to do so myself.
<br>Those Prussians really do have a 'nice style' just now. Since the action against the <i>National-Zeitung</i> could only serve to introduce a strident note of discord into the general constitutional harmony, the case must be stopped at all costs. The judges, 'and there still are such in Berlin',<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> are being got at and I'm quite positive that Mr Weber has been got at, too. It's quite plain to me from the whole tone of his letters. All the more need, then, to press on with the pamphlet<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> so that the noble Prussians can be shown that they are not, after all, able to suppress such things. Those swine. Might it be, perhaps, that they quietly affected such a liberal attitude towards me,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> in order to behave all the more abominably to yourself?
<br>If possible, I shall do Bohemia this evening.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> Incidentally, you should devise the pamphlet—difficult though this may be—in such a way as to make it absolutely impossible for the Prussians to ban it. And above all be quick, for it is probable that between now and 1861 the daydream of peace will gain ascendency and hence interest in high treason wane. Do try and be a bit superficial for once, so that you get it done in time.
<br>Your
<br>F. E. 
<br>Lommel's parcel there yet?
<br>Lupus leaves next week for a month's holiday in Ireland, etc., etc.

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Monte Carlo, 8 May 1882 Hôtel de Russie</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>2 or 3 weeks before I left Algiers (at the beginning of May), the meteorologists had already forecast storms at sea. In fact, during my last days in Africa, the sirocco blew itself out and very hot weather set in, spoilt, however, by gusts of wind, eddies of dust and unexpected, if temporary and often short-lived, drops in temperature. During that same time my bronchial catarrh grew worse and has not yet been properly subdued. The storm at sea (during the night of 4 to 5 May) was such that, even in the cabin, there was an appreciable draught. It was pouring when I arrived in Marseilles (on the morning of 5 May), and continued to rain all the way to Nice. I even imported <i>one wet day</i> (yesterday) into Monte Carlo; glorious weather today. So you see how constant I have remained, for until I arrived it hadn't rained for months in Nice or Monte Carlo. But this time it was just badinage, not real earnest as in Algiers.</p>
<p>In Nice, where I spent the 5th and 6th, I soon discovered that the wind could be very capricious and that a uniform, even temperature was by no means to be expected. Today my brief experience was confirmed by Dr Delachaux, <i>médecin-chirurgien</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>(lives at Interlaken), who is staying at the same hotel here. He has spent his holiday touring Nice and its environs, and the most famous places on the Riviera generally, so far with an eye to business as to ascertain which places he might best recommend to sufferers of lung diseases, bronchial catarrh of a chronic character, etc. He declared decidedly against Nice, but preferred Monte Carlo even to Menton. Dr Delachaux returns to his native Switzerland today.</p>
<p>You will know EVERYTHING about the charm exerted by the beauties of nature here, whether from your own observations, or from paintings and printed descriptions. Many of its features vividly recall those of Africa.</p>
<p>As regards a 'warm, dry atmosphere', it will soon, generally speaking, be available everywhere. The sun-spots indicate that there will be intense activity of the rays, and a drought is feared in France.</p>
<p>FOR CONSCIENCE SAKE I shall consult Kunemann, a German doctor, here tomorrow. I have with me Dr Stephann's written diagnosis (only on looking at his visiting card do I see that Stephann is also <i>Professeur suppléant à l'Ecole de Médecine</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>at the faculty of Algiers) which will spare me further talkee-talkee.— As soon as Stephann declared that I was rid of my pleurisy, I at once began, as prescribed by him (Stephann), to embrocate with tincture of iodine all the spots on the upper part (left) of my chest and back. Since the time I boarded the ship until TO-DAY I have discontinued these operations which would in any case be 'difficult' for me to carry out in person on my own back, despite Dr Delachaux's advice that I should attempt it with the help of a mirror. <i>Qui vivra verra</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>At all events, I shall speak to Dr Kunemann first. I am anxious to get out and about in the open air as much as I can.</p>
<p>Practically all the Parisian and Italian papers and periodicals are to be found in the reading room of the Monte Carlo Casino; a fair selection of German papers, very few English. I read in the <i>Petit Marseillais</i> of today's date about <b>l'assassinat de lord Cavendish et de M. Burke'.</b> The public here, e.g. my table-d'hôte companions in the Hôtel de Russie, is, by contrast, more interested in what goes on in the Casino's <i>salles de jeu (tables de roulette et de trente-et-quarante)</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>I was particularly amused by a son of Albion, sulky, ill-tempered and bewildered, AND WHY? Because he had lost a certain number of yellow boys, whereas he had been absolutely intent on 'copping' the same. He couldn't understand that not even British boorishness is able 'TO BULLY' fortune.</p>
<p>These lines must be my last since letters from here have first to be sent to the post office in Monaco by messenger.</p>
<p>Kindest regards to all.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Moor

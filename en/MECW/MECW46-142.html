MARX TO LAURA LAFARGUE</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Monte Carlo, 6 May 1882<br>
Hôtel de Russie</p>
<p>My dear Cacadou,</p>
<p>Only a few hours since I arrived here at Monte Carlo.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>I even doubt whether I shall find the time enough to indite a letter an- nounced already to Engels (at all events he will but receive it a day later).</p>
<p>For the present I am obliged to run about on different errands. I enclose one photo for you, another for Fred<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>; no art can make the man look worse.</p>
<p>Old Nick

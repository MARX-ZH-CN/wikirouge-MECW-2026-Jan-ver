ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY
<br>IN LONDON
<br>[Eastbourne,] 23 August 1886
<br>As you wrote to tell me you would be forwarding my letters, etc., on Saturday, I simply wanted to inform you that I got nothing either on Saturday or yesterday, nor had anything arrived by 7 p. m. today (Monday); I had at least counted on getting the <i>Sozialdemokrat.</i>
<br>Liebknecht has written to say he will probably be here this week. I shall come up for the day to collect him and shall write beforehand.
<br>Regards to your wife from Nim and
<br>Your
<br>F.E.

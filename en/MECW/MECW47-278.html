ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Eastbourne,] 23 August 1886</p>
<p>As you wrote to tell me you would be forwarding my letters, etc., on Saturday, I simply wanted to inform you that I got nothing either on Saturday or yesterday, nor had anything arrived by 7 p. m. today (Monday); I had at least counted on getting the <i>Sozialdemokrat.</i></p>
<p>Liebknecht has written to say he will probably be here this week. I shall come up for the day to collect him and shall write beforehand.</p>
<p>Regards to your wife from Nim and</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F.E.

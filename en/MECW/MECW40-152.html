MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 15 March [1858]</p>
<p>Dear Frederick,</p>
<p>'Burmah', 'Beresford', <i>Manchester Guardian</i> received. You haven't mentioned receiving a letter from me enclosing one from New York,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>etc. Considering how things are with the post just now, it's important that I should know. DROP, THEREFORE, TWO LINES.</p>
<p>A longer letter soon.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Marx refers to a letter he received from Friedrich Kamm dated 19 December  1857. Kamm, a German refugee in America, wrote that he and his friends had  set up a Communist Club in New York and asked Marx to send him  information about the communist movement in Europe, certain theoretical  works and Communist League documents. He also asked for practical advice in  organising the work of a newly founded club. Marx's reply has not been found,  but his letter to Joseph Weydemeyer of 1 February 1859 shows that he  corresponded with Albrecht Komp, another leader of the New York  Communist Club (see this volume, p. 376).—282, 288, 293, 469</span>

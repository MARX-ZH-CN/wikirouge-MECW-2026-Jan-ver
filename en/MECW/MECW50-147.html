<p>ENGELS TO HENRI RAVÉ</p>
<p>IN POITIERS</p>
<p><i>[Draft]</i></p>
<p>[London], 10 January 1894</p>
<p>Dear citizen,</p>
<p>A thousand thanks for your good wishes for the New Year, which, I hope, will bring you good fortune also!</p>
<p>The translation of my book,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> as it is at present, seems to me to be very good. As for the rest, since I edited the proofs, I also bear my share of the responsibility.</p>
<p>The style of Thomas Morus<sup>a</sup> will really seem rather heavy to the French public, but there are some good points, and the historical estimates have a more than transitory value.</p>
<p>At the moment I have no book I can offer you for translation, but if I find something, I shall let you know.</p>
<p>Yours respectfully.

Having read the thus revised translation, Engels had a high opinion of the work done. The book was published in October 1893 under the title <i>L'Origine de la famille, de la propriété privée et de l'état.</i></span>

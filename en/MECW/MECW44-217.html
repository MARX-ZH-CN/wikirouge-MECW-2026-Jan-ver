ENGELS TO GENNARO BOVIO</p>
<p>IN TRANI</p>
<p>London, 16 April 1872</p>
<p><i>To Citizen Gennaro Bovio, Trani</i><sup>4SS</sup></p>
<p>Esteemed Citizen,</p>
<p>I have received, and am returning with thanks, the various documents which you were so kind as to send me through esteemed Citizen Enrico Bignami.</p>
<p>The General Council of the International, as an administrative committee with clearly defined functions, has not been able to become acquainted with these documents and discuss them <i>officially.</i> I did, however, consider it my duty to submit them to those of its members who understand Italian, and they have all read them with great pleasure.</p>
<p>We are happy to acknowledge that, at the same time as an international league of workers was being formed here in London, you, in far-off Apulia, had the same idea and bravely promoted it at the Naples Congress.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>We are grateful to you for informing us of this: it is fresh proof that the alliance of workers of the civilised world was already recognised in 1864 as a historical necessity, even in countries with which we were unable to establish contacts at that time, not knowing whom to address.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>And we sincerely regret that the Italian workers' societies, not having taken up your idea in 1864, have greatly delayed the development of the proletarian movement in Italy.</p>
<p>It gave us great pleasure to read your articles in the <i>Liberia</i> defending the Paris Commune against V. Hugo and others<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>; we willingly believe that they were the first articles to be written with this purpose in Italian. We published here at the same time the manifesto of the General Council on <i>The Civil War in France,</i> of which I have taken the liberty of sending you, on 23 March, a copy in English and one in German, since I do not have the French translation and the Italian one (in the <i>Eguaglianza</i> of Girgenti<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>) has not yet been completed. You will see from this pamphlet that our ideas coincide on this matter too, and that we have not failed in our duty either.</p>
<p>Greetings and brotherhood</p>
<p>Frederick Engels<br>
Secretary for Italy to the General Council<br>
of the International Working Men's Association

At the congress, Gennaro Bovio, representative of the Workers' Association of Trani, suggested that international workers' congresses be regularly convened, and that common Rules be worked out for them.</span>

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Crossed out after '...address' in the draft of the letter: 'No doubt, if the Italian workers' societies in 1864, had taken up your idea and thus called into being, at that time, an Italian working-class movement based on the social conditions of their country, fewer workers' societies in Italy today would be advocating sectarian doctrines which, moreover, are not Italian but French or Russian. I further believe that in the working-class movement <i>true</i> national ideas, i.e. ideas corresponding to the economic realities, both in industry and in agriculture, to the realities that are dominant in the country in question, are, at the same time, true <i>international</i> ideas. The emancipation of the Italian peasant will not occur in the same form as the emancipation of the English factory worker, but the better the one and the other realise what form corresponds to his conditions, the less will they disagree on matters of substance'.</span>

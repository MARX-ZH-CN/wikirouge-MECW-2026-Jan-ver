<p><i>Berne</i>, November 22. At today's sitting of the National Council, there was a long debate in which General Dufour made an excellent speech in support of Tessin. All the other military men in the Council — Ziegler, Michel, Benz etc. — bitterly opposed Tessin and after Pioda had made an admirable reply to all the attacks, a motion of the minority on the commission
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"to intern the Italian refugees who took part in the recent uprising and to leave the execution of this decision to the Government of Tessin"
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>was rejected on a roll-call by 62 votes to 31. On the other hand, the majority motions
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1) to expel <i>all</i> Italian refugees from the canton of Tessin into the Swiss interior, taking into account humanitarian considerations, on which the representatives of the Confederation shall decide",
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"2) to forbid the canton of Tessin until further notice to allow Italian refugees to remain there",
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>were adopted by 62 votes to 31 and 50 votes to 46 respectively. The two Zurich deputies, Escher and Furrer, decided the issue by skilfully influencing the German Swiss; Furrer threw his whole weight as President of the Federal Council onto the scales against Dufour's noble gentlemanliness and almost brought the matter to a vote of confidence. The 31 votes for Tessin were, with five or six exceptions, all French Swiss. During the roll-call one heard nothing but "<i>oui</i>" and "<i>nein</i>", not one "<i>non</i>", and only five or six "<i>jas</i>". Romance Switzerland was hopelessly overwhelmed by the Germans.</p>
<p>The remaining points in the majority motion, to which the minority (Herr Pioda) also agreed, are just being adopted. The sitting and the post-office close at the same time. More details of this interesting debate tomorrow.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>

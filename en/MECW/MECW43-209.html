MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 16 June 1869</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>Arrived safely the day before yesterday<sup>3</sup> after 5 hours rail travel. From Manchester (by the railway line on which I travelled) you have to take a ticket to <i>KENTISH TOWN STATION.</i> Then you are near my house. St. Paneras is one station further, more in the town.</p>
<p>Was in the International yesterday evening. Letter from Paris. 3-4 of our people (Murat, Varlin, etc.) arrested. They write that the GAMINERIES, DEVASTATION of the <i>kiosques,</i> etc., were carried out <i>by police agents,</i> who were allowed to do what they liked; then bystanders were attacked. The aim was to produce something 'bloody'.</p>
<p>Your trunk will be sent back today. You will find in it a wallet of yours that travelled with me, while a notebook of mine remained in Manchester.</p>
<p>Best greetings to all.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Moor
</p>

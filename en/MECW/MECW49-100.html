ENGELS TO WALERY WRÔBLEWSKI</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London,] 9 April 1891</p>
<p>My dear Wrôblewski,</p>
<p>You must forgive me if I ask you not to insist on my carrying out the commission entrusted to me in your letter of the 5th. I have no right to meddle either in the Polish party's internal affairs, of which I have virtually no knowledge, or in the private affairs of Citizen Mendelson.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>In the circumstances it seems to me that further intervention on my part could only be detrimental to the effect you hope to achieve. In your own interest it would, I believe, be preferable for you to come to an understanding with Mendelson direct. You can do so without the slightest fear that letters addressed to 1 Hyde Park Mansions, N.W. will fail to reach him, for I know that he is now installed there.</p>
<p>Hoping that you will be successful and that you will soon be able to let me have better news,</p>
<p>I remain,</p>
<p>Yours sincerely
</p>

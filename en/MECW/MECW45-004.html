ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE</p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>London, 14 February 1874</p>
<p>Dear Sorge,</p>
<p>Just a very hasty note to let you know that around a fortnight ago I sent you 1 parcel with 12 <i>Alliances</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and the day before yesterday, 2 parcels, each with 50 copies of the English Rules,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> i.e. 100 in all.</p>
<p>I have managed to get hold of around three hundred copies of the German Rules here, and the English Federal Council has promised me a further 400-500 English ones. As soon as I have them, I shall send you the whole lot, together with some <i>Alliances,</i> per PARCELS COMPANY. The post is becoming too expensive; the English Rules cost 4 shillings! To save you problems with customs duties I shall refer to you on the cover as GENERAL SECRETARY, I.W.A.</p>
<p>It was obvious that the New York movement would slip out of your hands as soon as PUBLIC MEETINGS and other demonstrations replaced real work and organisation.</p>
<p>I suppose the German gentlemen will have found out by now what it means to join forces with the Yankee swindlers.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. Engels</p>
<p>More soon!

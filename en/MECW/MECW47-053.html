ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY
<br>IN ZURICH
<br>London, 4 February 1884
<br>Dear Kautsky,
<br>A quick line before the post goes. Please write and tell me by return <i>what</i> sort of version you propose to do of Deville<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> —word for word, including all the titles, or abridged, as I suggested?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> As soon as I know this, I can put the matter to Meissner; I must have something definite to tell him. A copy has been ordered for Meissner in Paris; by the time it arrives, your answer may have got here as well.
<br>I shall be glad to look over the <i>theoretical</i> part, although I can hardly suppose it is necessary. There's no point in my looking over the descriptive part, as you won't have any difficulty in avoiding Deville's mistakes. Of these the chief is his presenting as absolute, Marxian propositions which, in Marx, hold good only with qualifications (omitted by Deville) and which therefore appear false.
<br>All other matters in a day or two.
<br>Yours,
<br>F.E.

ENGELS TO GEORGE WILLIAM LAMPLUGH, G. W. 324
<br>IN LONDON
<br>London, 10 January 1894 122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.
<br>My dear Lamplugh,
<br>Your parcel was an agreeable surprise indeed. Many thanks! I am almost ashamed to confess that in my ignorance I had fancied the <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i> to be one of the serious psychological disquisitions of the 18th century, which I hold in horror. Now I find that it, too, is a product of the grandest epoch of English literature, the beginning of the 17th century. I turn to it with pleasure, and have already seen enough to assure me that it will prove a constant source of enjoyment.
<br>This reminds me that I have forgotten to let you have the only two works of mine that have been published in English<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> —I have made free to send them, to you by post and hope you will do me the favour of accepting them.
<br>Dakyns told me on Sunday you were afraid of your little boy getting the influenza. Although there is more about of this beastly complaint than is desirable, I hope the danger has blown over.
<br>Reciprocating your kind wishes for the New Year and with kind regards to Mrs Lamplugh.
<br>I remain yours faithfully F.
<br>Engels

<p><i>To Ferdinand Lassalle in Berlin</i>
</p>
<h4 class="mw-headline" id="ME41-7-2">London, 30 January 1860</h4><a id="London,_30_January_1860"></a>
<p>Dear Lassalle,</p>
<p>I was very glad to get your letter. For I had believed — and had written to tell Engels so — that your reason for not writing was pique at my last letter.</p>
<p>I can only spare a minute or two since I have a leader to write today for the <i>New-York Tribune</i>. Quite briefly then:</p>
<p>1. I shall send you the pamphlet on the 'Communist Trial' straight away. So far as I am aware, you have already had one from me.</p>
<p>2. Vogt has been careful not to let his <i>Telleringian</i> concoction — i.e. the first version — reach us here. Neither Freiligrath (whom I have just seen) nor Kinkel, nor the <i>Hermann,</i> nor <i>any of the booksellers over here</i> have had it. The imperial rascal wishes, <b>of course</b>, to steal a march on me.</p>
<p>What I know, I have learned from the <i>National-Zeitung.</i> A pack of <i>Stieberian</i> lies. I have written and told my <i>lawyer in Berlin</i> to sue the N-Z. for <i>libel.</i> What do you think of this? Let me know <i>by return.</i></p>
<p>From your letter I see that Vogt himself admits having been bought <i>indirectly</i> by Bonaparte, for I <i>know</i> about the <i>manoeuvres</i> of your revolutionary Hungarians. I denounced them in London in an <i>English</i> paper and had five <b>copies</b> sent to Mr Kossuth. He kept his trap shut. In New York, and elsewhere, <i>Hungarian refugees</i> have adopted resolutions <i>censuring him.</i></p>
<p>Your reasoning <i>ad vocem</i> Vogt eludes me. I shall <i>write a pamphlet</i> as soon as I get hold of his rubbish. But I shall begin by saying in the foreword that I <i>don't give a damn</i> about the opinion of <i>your German public.</i></p>
<p><i>Liebknecht</i> is an upright man. The Augsburg <i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i> is — to <i>my</i> mind — just as good as the <i>N-Z.</i> and the <i>Volks-Zeitung.</i></p>
<p>To judge by the excerpts I have seen in the <i>N-Zeitung,</i> Vogt is some kind of Chenu or de la Hodde.</p>
<p>3. About my work on political economy — the second instalment, when it appears, will contain only the conclusion of section 1, Book 1, and there are six books. Hence you cannot wait <i>until it is finished</i> . However, you would, in <i>your own interests,</i> be well-advised to await the next instalment which contains the <i>quintessence.</i> Appalling circumstances are to blame for the fact that it isn't yet in Berlin.</p>
<p>Salut.<br>K. M.

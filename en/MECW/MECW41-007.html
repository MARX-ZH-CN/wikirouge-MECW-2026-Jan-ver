<p>Dear Lassalle,</p>
<p>I was very glad to get your letter. For I had believed — and had written to tell Engels so — that your reason for not writing was pique at my last letter.</p>
<p>I can only spare a minute or two since I have a leader to write today for the <em>New-York Tribune</em>. Quite briefly then:</p>
<p>1. I shall send you the pamphlet on the 'Communist Trial' straight away. So far as I am aware, you have already had one from me.</p>
<p>2. Vogt has been careful not to let his <em>Telleringian</em> concoction — i.e. the first version — reach us here. Neither Freiligrath (whom I have just seen) nor Kinkel, nor the <em>Hermann,</em> nor <em>any of the booksellers over here</em> have had it. The imperial rascal wishes, <b>of course</b>, to steal a march on me.</p>
<p>What I know, I have learned from the <em>National-Zeitung.</em> A pack of <em>Stieberian</em> lies. I have written and told my <em>lawyer in Berlin</em> to sue the N-Z. for <em>libel.</em> What do you think of this? Let me know <em>by return.</em></p>
<p>From your letter I see that Vogt himself admits having been bought <em>indirectly</em> by Bonaparte, for I <em>know</em> about the <em>manoeuvres</em> of your revolutionary Hungarians. I denounced them in London in an <em>English</em> paper and had five <b>copies</b> sent to Mr Kossuth. He kept his trap shut. In New York, and elsewhere, <em>Hungarian refugees</em> have adopted resolutions <em>censuring him.</em></p>
<p>Your reasoning <em>ad vocem</em> Vogt eludes me. I shall <em>write a pamphlet</em> as soon as I get hold of his rubbish. But I shall begin by saying in the foreword that I <em>don't give a damn</em> about the opinion of <em>your German public.</em></p>
<p><em>Liebknecht</em> is an upright man. The Augsburg <em>Allgemeine Zeitung</em> is — to <em>my</em> mind — just as good as the <em>N-Z.</em> and the <em>Volks-Zeitung.</em></p>
<p>To judge by the excerpts I have seen in the <em>N-Zeitung,</em> Vogt is some kind of Chenu or de la Hodde.</p>
<p>3. About my work on political economy — the second instalment, when it appears, will contain only the conclusion of section 1, Book 1, and there are six books. Hence you cannot wait <em>until it is finished</em> . However, you would, in <em>your own interests,</em> be well-advised to await the next instalment which contains the <em>quintessence.</em> Appalling circumstances are to blame for the fact that it isn't yet in Berlin.</p>
<p>Salut.<br>K. M.

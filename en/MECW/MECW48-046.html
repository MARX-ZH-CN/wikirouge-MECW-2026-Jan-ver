ENGELS TO JOHN LINCOLN MAHON<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>IN LONDON
<br>London, 22 June 1887
<br>Dear Mahon,
<br>Enclosed your programme with a few suggestions.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> —I consider it very good as a spontaneous working-class declaration of principles— requiring but a little more precision of language here and there, and a few additions.
<br>Sorry I could not send it before but have sore eyes and dare not read or write much and had many interruptions—will write more fully to- morrow.
<br>Yours faithfully
<br>F. Engels

On 14 June Engels received a copy of the programme from Mahon with the request to comment on it. Engels sent his suggestions concerning the introductory part of the programme (see present edition, Vol. 26). They were not put into effect since the Federation only lasted a few months.</span>

MARX TO ACHILLE LORIA</p>
<p>IN MANTUA</p>
<p>London, 13 November 1880<br>41 Maitland Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Mr Loria,</p>
<p>Domestic upsets resulting from my wife's very dangerous illness have delayed my reply to your letter of 14 September. I regret that my lack of personal means does not allow me to provide for your stay in London, the more so since I have the highest opinion of your talent, your learning and your scientific future.</p>
<p>Being of a somewhat solitary disposition and eschewing as I do all contact with the English press, I have very little influence and few connections to place at your disposal. I know from experience that Italian competition, as regards both contributions to the press and private lessons, is OVERDONE in London, as in every other sphere of the struggle for existence.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, on the re-opening of Parliament — until which time everyone, i. e. <i>THE UPPER TEN THOUSANDS,</i> deserts the metropolis — I shall consult SOME WELL-MEANING AND INFLUENTIAL MEN. In the meantime, perhaps you would be so kind as to let me know whether you speak French and a modicum of English.</p>
<p>Yours very faithfully,</p>
<p>Karl Marx
</p>

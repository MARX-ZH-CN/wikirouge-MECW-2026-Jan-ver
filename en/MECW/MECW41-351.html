<p>Dear Mr Engels,</p>
<p>Moor sends you herewith the '<b>Most Noble</b> Daoud Bey's' <i>Free Press.</i> It will amuse you a lot. Karl, alas, cannot write himself. For the past week he has been very unwell and is tied to the sofa. 2 boils appeared on his cheek and back. The one on his cheek responded to the household remedies one normally uses for such things. The other, on his back, has assumed such dimensions and is so inflamed that poor Moor is enduring the most frightful pain and gets no respite either by day or by night. You can imagine, too, how depressed this business makes him. It seems as though the wretched book [<i>Capital</i>] will never get finished. It weighs like a nightmare on us all. If only the <b>Leviathan</b> were <b>launched</b>!</p>
<p>With warmest regards from us all.</p>
<p>Yours,<br>Jenny Marx

MARX TO ADOLPHE HUBERT<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 22 November 1871</p>
<p>Dear Citizen,</p>
<p>My ailment continues to keep me indoors, thereby preventing me from doing all I should like to do to support the better elements on the <i>Qui Vive!</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Nevertheless I have spoken to several of my French friends, though I don't know whether they have started things moving.</p>
<p>As to the terms of admission to the <i>International,</i> all that is needed is recognition of our principles. I am sending you 30 CARDS OF MEMBERSHIP which you may dispose of as and when you find new candidates. They only have to pay ONE PENNY for their annual contribution but may subscribe more if they so wish. All you have to do is enter the names of new members on the cards.</p>
<p>I am also sending you 30 copies of the Rules.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Every member must be supplied with a copy, which costs ONE PENNY.</p>
<p>In accordance with a resolution passed at the last Conference,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> adhesive stamps are now being manufactured representing the value of one PENNY, and these must be affixed to the Rules in possession of members.</p>
<p>Those who have already paid for their cards will not have to make a further payment for the stamps.</p>
<p>THE PAMPHLET ON <i>The Civil War in France</i> is SOLD AT Truelove's, 256 High Holborn.</p>
<p>Fraternal greetings,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

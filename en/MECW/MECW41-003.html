<p>TO BERTALAN SZEMERE IN PARIS</p>
<p><br>
London, 12 January 1860</p>
<p>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>Thanks for the point you have in my affair.1S This letter has been delayed, because I had entered into negotiations, on behalf of your publication, with a publisher who, having put me off from day to day, withdrew at last.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Bentley is not your man. Try once with John Murray. In writing to those fellows, never forget to sign as ancient Minister. This is something with those flunkeys.</p>
<p>Yours truly</p>
<p>A. W.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><br>
Would you be so kind to inform me, in your next letter, of the real state of things in Hungary?
</p>

Szemere's pamphlet appeared in Paris in 1860 under the title <i>La Question hongroise</i> (1848-1860) and in London, in  Bentley's publishing house, the same year, under the title Hungary, from 1848 to 1860.</span>

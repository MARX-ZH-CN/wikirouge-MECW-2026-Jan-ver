ENGELS TO AMÉLIE ENGEL<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London, around 1879-1880]</p>
<p>Madame,</p>
<p>Many years of experience have impressed upon me the principle that under no circumstances should one give financial aid to strangers.</p>
<p>Moreover I cannot at this moment raise the sum you want. Were I able to do so, I should be under an obligation to use it, as I do <i>every penny</i> I can spare, for the relief of our German party comrades who are being persecuted by Bismarck.</p>
<p>Besides, since you have connections that will procure you audiences with princesses, you are unlikely to experience difficulty in extricating yourself from this momentary embarrassment.</p>
<p>Finally, I cannot refrain from mentioning that, while your visit came as a surprise to me, I have since then been equally certain of receiving a request of the kind contained in your letter.</p>
<p>Yours very truly

<p><i>To Engels in Manchester</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 9 May 1865</b></p>
<p><b>Dear Fred</b>,</p>
<p>You need not send anything back (except Schily's letter). just keep the things safely. I enclose <b>one</b> <i>Free Press</i> (the <b>queer article</b> on the '<b>Reconstruction of Italy</b>' is from the pen of the <b>High Priest</b> himself, from Urquhart), also two <i>Nordsterns</i> (one of them somewhat out of date). I've got a subscription to the latter, but no longer to the <i>Social-Demokrat.</i> The latest <i>Nordstern</i> will give you some idea of the situation on the Rhine. Incidentally, the <i>total number</i> of the faithful whom B. Becker still commands is barely 1,000.</p>
<p>Before I forget: there were several allusions to your pamphlet in the debate in the Prussian Chamber. <i>Gneist,</i> for instance, said the Minister of War would not persuade them, even if his statistics spoke with the tongue of '<i>Engels'</i> (Laughter.) (That is how the affair appeared in the <i>Berliner Reform</i>.)</p>
<p>As everywhere, the London workers, of course, also include <b>a knot of asses, fools and rogues, rallying</b> round a scoundrel. The scoundrel in this case is 'George Potter', <b>a rat of a man, supported</b> by a <b>venal</b> but witty Irishman by the name of <i>Connolly,</i> who is a dangerous <b>stump-orator</b>. Although the bourgeoisie hate the said Potter as chief <b>strike-manager</b>, they do, nevertheless, support him against our people because they smell <b>venality</b> in him, whereas they know that our people are <b>true men</b>. This Potter <b>derives his power</b> particularly from the fact that he is <b>presently</b> the <b>Manager</b> of <i>The Bee-Hive,</i> the official organ of the <b>trades unions</b>, although he uses it against the <b>Official Council</b> of these <b>unions</b> which is in our hands. Since the paper is based on shares, the idea is now to distribute as many <b>shares</b> as possible (<b>5sh. per share</b>) amongst our workers. For my part I have undertaken to collect the <b>money</b> for <b>about</b> 30 <b>shares</b>. For this, I'm counting on <b>you</b> (<b>single handed</b> or with friends) for £5, <b>I write to</b> Dronke for £1 and I will pay the rest myself. (Although <b>my function</b> with the <b>Central Council</b> costs me a <i>lot</i> of money, compared with what I can afford.) The money must already be <b>at hand</b> <i>this</i> week, as the General Meeting of the <b>shareholders</b> is next week. If we are only strong enough (and Odger, for instance, has guaranteed 50 <b>shares</b>) to elect the <b>Directors</b><i>,</i> we shall have that rogue Potter (who is only the <b>Manager</b>) <b>under our thumbs</b>. This matter is of decisive importance for the whole movement.</p>
<p>E. Jones was here, very charming <b>socially speaking</b>. But between ourselves, <i>he is only</i> trying to use our Association for electoral agitation. Of the 12 cards I sent him, he returned 11, he had not sold a single one, whereas <b>poor</b> Schily, for instance, paid for <i>24</i> for himself alone. I told him he should just put them back in his pocket again, I would dispose of them later, but I could not appear in front of the English workers and tell them that. <b>By and by he will find out</b> that if only for speculative reasons he should not have treated the business so lightly and <b>rather contemptibly</b>. <i>I will</i> write to him and tell him to hand over the '<b>Addresses'</b> to <b>you</b>. You can give them to whomsoever you please. They are just dead weight with him. Incidentally, I don't take kindly to the fact that he was here to wangle a job as <b>Recorder</b> out of Sir <i>G.</i> Grey either.</p>
<p>Today I am to submit an '<b>Address to President Johnson</b> Mr <i>Le Lubez</i> wants to return to the <b>Council</b> as — <b>Delegate for Deptford</b>, the same fellow as resigned as <b>Delegate for France, but his admittance</b> (<b>We have to confirm the delegates</b>) <b>will not run quite so smoothly as he seems to fancy</b>. I would be pleased if you could form even just <b>a branch of 6 men</b> in Manchester, and could get yourself elected as their <b>correspondent for London</b>. For <b>the corresponding</b> people are <i>eo ipso</i> <b>members of the Central Council</b>, and have a seat and a vote on it, <b>when at London</b>.</p>
<p>New <b>branches</b> have been formed in Lyon, Neufchâteau (<i>département des Vosges</i>) and St Denis. The French <b>branches</b> (apart from Paris) are not linked with Paris, in view of the existing laws, but directly with London.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to put the finishing touches to my book [<i>Capital</i>] by 1 September (despite numerous interruptions). It's going ahead well, although I am still not quite well.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.

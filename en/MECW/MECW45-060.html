ENGELS TO PYOTR LAVROV</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 24 September 1875 122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>My dear Mr Lavrov,</p>
<p>On my return from Ramsgate where I had spent a few weeks,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I found your letter of the 20th, along with a pile of newspapers, books, etc. which had arrived during my absence. To start with I shall try to get all this into some kind of order and, as soon as possible, turn to reading your article in <i>Brieped^!*</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> —so as to be able to tell you where we agree and where we differ in our views on the relationship of socialism to the struggle for existence as propounded by Darwin.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> If this does not reach you within a day or two, you must excuse me on the grounds of the many letters I have to write and the backlog of work that remains to be tackled, since for the past month I have only been able to do those things which absolutely had to be done without delay.</p>
<p>I do not know the pamphlet of which you speak;<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> if you could let me have it by post for a day or two, I should be much obliged.</p>
<p>We once more have a Portuguese paper, <i>O Protesto</i> (The Protest) of Lisbon, of which six (weekly) issues have appeared— editorial department, Rua do Bemformoso 110, second floor, management, Rua dos Cardaes de Jesus (!) 69, second floor. I still have not looked through the four issues we have received.</p>
<p>Would you kindly remember me to Mr and Mrs Smirnov.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>F. Engels

It was spearheaded against Marx's and Engels' work<i> The Alliance of Socialist  Democracy and the International Working Men's Association</i> (see present edition, Vol. 23).<br>Lavrov wrote to Engels on 20 September 1875: 'You have probably seen a small pamphlet that Nechayev's anonymous followers have published in Brussels as a response to the pamphlet about the "Alliance". But, of course, neither the group nor its writings are of any value whatsoever.' In late September-early October 1875 Lavrov sent a copy of the pamphlet to Engels.</span>

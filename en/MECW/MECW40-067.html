MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 23 May 1857</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>The enclosed arrived from Dana this morning. It puzzles me how the Yankee can expect the stuff for Vol. I to be in New York by the beginning of July if he doesn't let us know what he wants until the end of May.</p>
<p>You might reconsider which articles one should offer to do, apart from the military. Philosophical stuff is, in fact, too badly paid and also difficult when it has TO BE DONE IN ENGLISH. Do you know if there happens to be any German or French book on the biographies of big industrialists?</p>
<p>I'm equally puzzled as to how aesthetics is to be dealt with in 1 PAGE, FUNDAMENTALLY, and on a Hegelian basis.</p>
<p>Does Lupus feel inclined to take something on? Enclosed also a letter from Miquel. I do not, in fact, understand his theory of 'non-overproduction' and yet of 'lack of the wherewith to pay for production', unless it be that the utterly superficial blather of the utterly wretched CURRENCY chaps<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> has taken root in Germany.</p>
<p>Saint</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

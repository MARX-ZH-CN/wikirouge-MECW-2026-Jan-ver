TO WILHELM WOLFF IN ZURICH
<br>[Manchester, 1 May 1851]
<br>Dear Lupus,
<br>From the date on your letter which Marx brought me when he visited me here in Manchester a few days ago, I am horrified to see that it is nearly a month old. However Marx tells me that he wrote to you at once.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>As to your American plans,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> dismiss them from your mind. They are superfluous and you'll find something in London straight away, since you know English and there is a demand for people as well-grounded as yourself in ancient languages, especially if you have your testimonials with you. After all, quite insignificant persons have been given the most excellent positions. The American journal<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> affair is nothing but humbug; do you imagine that if there were anything in it, the fellow<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> would write to Europe for an editor and wait so long? Who knows what is really the case and what has happened in the meantime? You might have to wait till doomsday before being advanced the money for your trip. Moreover at best the thing isn't such as to warrant your going to Chicago on the strength of it; 4 dollars a week is less than the lowliest wood-cutter's daily wage, and, on top of that, one week's notice, which is very general there!
<br>[...] I hope that you'll have it by now and, as soon as it is in your possession, pack your bags, obtain a passport to London and up anchor. I see that newspapers on the Continent are implying that the British Government are not admitting any more refugees. Stuff! Don't let anything put you off, not even, say, a directive from the police that you must have a visa from the British Ambassador in Berne. You need nothing of the kind. All you need is a visa enabling you to cross France, i.e. from the French Embassy, which the Swiss will procure for you. You simply pass through the country and cross over here. Even should the French—and they're quite capable of this—direct you to Le Havre and thence to America, all you have to do at Le Havre is board the steamer for Southampton or London. You know that no one is ever stopped at a port of entry here, and despite all the empty chatter in the reactionary press, I hope to see you in London for the Exhibition.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> As I have told you, don't let anything put you off but, whatever happens, insist on going to London.
<br>Should you experience difficulties over transit with the French Government, and if funds permit, it might even be preferable to take the route I took<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> [...] write Lorenzo Chiozza [...] very nice letter saying you have been given his address by a compatriot of his, and would be much obliged if he would advise you whether any vessels and which, bound for England, are lying there (sailing vessels, there are also steamers) and approximately when they are due to sail. Ask him, too, for the names of the captains. Then you can either communicate with these captains by letter (addressed to them aboard their vessels), or go to them direct. My passage, including food, cost me six pounds (150 French fr.). You might get one cheaper. The trip to Genoa isn't expensive provided you do as much as possible of the journey to Turin on foot—up to that point the country is wonderful—via Geneva and Mont Cenis or, more direct, via the Great St Bernhard (Martigny-Ivrea). From Turin you have the railway almost to the foot of the Apennines. Or by footpath (even more direct) via the Reuss Valley, the Furka, the Simplon, straight to Alessandria. These are all very beautiful trips, the weather is now splendid for a sea voyage (easterlies predominating), and the Mediterranean passage most diverting. If possible an English vessel. In my opinion the whole thing could be done on 250 fr., certainly on 300. But whether the people in Cologne<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> will be able to manage this is debatable. But in any case you must get to England. I am on the point of writing to Marx, asking him to write once more to Cologne about the money<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> ; if you haven't got it yet, it could do no harm if you, too, were to write again to Daniels or Bürgers.
<br>As regards the fares from England to New York, they are devilish high—'tween-deck passengers often come off very badly, one such case being still before Parliament—1st class cabin usually costs £15-20; this we discovered when we ourselves were proposing to press on further.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> 2nd class on the Southampton steamers is good and cheap; there are also a few screw-steamers aboard which you could travel 2nd class quickly and cheaply if you chanced on one. But whatever the case, I hope that you will come here and stay here. You would have more opportunities here than in America and it's not so easy, once you're there, to come back again. It's frightful in America where the greatest man is Heinzen and where, too, the prolix Struve is now about to inundate the whole country with his piddle. The devil take the public there. Sooner a galley-slave in Turkey than a journalist in America.
<br>Send us word soon and come soon yourself.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

In March 1851 Wolff received through Anneke an offer of a post as editor of the <i>Illinois Staats-Zeitung</i>, while his Silesian friend Voidechovsky invited him to teach at a high school for girls at St. Louis (Missouri). Meanwhile, on 13 March an expulsion order was issued against him. In his letter to Marx of 5 April Wolff asked for assistance in getting a passport and money to go to England and on to the USA via Liverpool. Engels did his utmost to get passports and money for Wolff and Dronke through the Cologne Central Authority of the Communist League. About 9 June 1851 Wolff arrived in London and remained in England.— 339, 342</span>

On 5 October 1849 he arrived in Genoa, and on the following day left for England on a British schooner via Gibraltar and the Bay of Biscay. The voyage lasted nearly five weeks. About 12 November, Engels arrived in London as was reported in the item: 'London, 14. Nov.' by the <i>Westdeutsche Zeitung</i>, No. 154, 20 November 1849.</span>

No documents have been found to prove this, but the perspective may have occurred to them in the summer of 1850. That was when Marx wrote to Joseph Weydemeyer that if the Whig ministry were to fall they would be 'the Tories' first victims', in which case 'long-intended expulsion' would become a probability (see this volume, p. 240).—341</span>

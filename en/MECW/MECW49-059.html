ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE</p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>London, 3 January 1891<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Dear Sorge,</p>
<p><i>Avant tout</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> a Happy New Year to you and your wife.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Unfortunately I didn't make a note of the date of my last postcard in which I replied to the more urgent points in your letter. ' ' 6</p>
<p>Many thanks for the excellent photograph of you and your wife. I should like to send you one of myself but the constant fog and snow we have had since 25 November have made it impossible to obtain ei- ther a photograph or a print from the negative plate. As soon as the light is suitable, I shall have my photograph taken again so as to see what I look like at the age of 70, and your requirements will then be promptly attended to.</p>
<p>Louise Kautsky is staying with me. I'm very very grateful to the good child for the sacrifice she is thereby making on my behalf. Once again I am able to work in tranquillity, indeed better than ever, as she will also be my secretary. I have enough for her to do but not for a man brought in from outside. So everything is proving unexpect- edly pleasant and snug and there is sunshine in my house once more, even though the fog is as thick as ever outside.</p>
<p>I think I have already told you that you may use my letters in any way you think fit. But after all it's<i>jo« who are supposed to keep </i>us<i> in- formed about America!</i></p>
<p>Your complaint was promptly forwarded to Paris. ' ' 7 But will it do any good? BUSINESS IS NOT THEIR FORCE!</p>
<p>According to latest reports Sam Moore, Chief Justice at Asaba on the Niger, is in poor health. Having stood the climate so well, he has now been afflicted all of a sudden with diarrhoea, fever, and conges- tion of the spleen and liver—I am anxiously awaiting the next post the day after tomorrow. He will be back here in April on 6 months' furlough.</p>
<p>In Europe the most important event of the last 3 months has been the slaying of Seliverstov by Padlewski ' ° ' and—which is what the government <i>wanted</i>—the latter's escape. Evidence that Paris was the headquarters of Russia's <i>mouchards</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> abroad, that the French Republic was to carry out espionage and render ignoble services for the Tsar as the prior condition of an alliance with Russia and, finally, Pad- lewski's bold deed which evoked a powerful and sympathetic re- sponse from every fibre of the French tradition—all this proved the last straw. The Franco-Russian alliance was dead before it had reached its term and been born (Louise Kautsky is a midwife, hence the simile) and this, not only because the bourgeois Republicans would not have liked it, even today, but also because the people in Peters- burg have realised that it would misfire at the crucial moment and hence isn't worth a damn. As far as world peace is concerned, that is a tremendous gain.</p>
<p>Fog, darkness—must stop. Many regards to your wife and you yourself.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F.E.

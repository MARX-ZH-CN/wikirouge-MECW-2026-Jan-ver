ENGELS TO FILIPPO TURATI</p>
<p>IN MILAN</p>
<p>[London,] 18 March 1892</p>
<p>Dear Citizen Turati,</p>
<p>Thank you for the two copies of the <i>illustrious one's</i> reply which you were kind enough to send me. Needless to say, I have no intention of letting him have an answer, for if he didn't mean to discuss and didn't discuss the German Socialists, what were his reasons for quoting my article<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>and appending his comments to his quotations? It's more incoherent than ever, but to be charitable, one must suppose that he had totally forgotten what he had written in the <i>Tribunal.</i></p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>F.E.

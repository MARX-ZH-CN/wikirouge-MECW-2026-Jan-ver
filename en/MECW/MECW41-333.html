MARX TO ENGELS
<br>IN MANCHESTER
<br>Ramsgate, 25 July 1864<br>46 Hardres Street
<br>Dear Frederick,
<br>You will see from the address that I am spending a few days in Ramsgate.
<br>It was a far from agreeable surprise to discover that my FURUNCLE was in fact an extremely malignant CARBUNCLE and, what is more, has had the impudence to erupt just above my penis. So, for ABOUT 10 days, I've been obliged to spend most of my time in bed—and in this heat, too! The thing is clearing up pretty quickly here; however, my confidence has completely evaporated now that the disease has unexpectedly cropped up again in such a malignant form.
<br>Jenny and Tussy are here with me; Laura is coming the day after tomorrow and in ABOUT 8 or 10 days we shall go to Holland, during which time my wife will betake herself to the seaside.
<br>Apropos. <i>Don't forget to send the latter</i> her <i>chain,</i> as she will need this for her watch when at the resort. She says all you have to do is put it in a little box and have it posted, so sending it off couldn't possibly put you to much trouble.
<br>I hope you have now sorted things out with Ermen and are no longer being BOTHERED by LAWYERS.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>As for the Schleswig-Holstein affair, I'm not yet wholly convinced that it won't end in a personal union between the Duchies and Denmark. The jealousy between Prussia and Austria and that felt by both towards the German Confederation, as well as the quarrel between Augustenburg<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and Russia's pretender, Oldenburg,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> etc., mean that such a solution is still at least a possibility, even at this late hour. Incidentally, as far back as 1851, Palmerston put forward the Duke of Oldenburg<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> <i>en passant</i> and as a <i>pis aller</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> as candidate for Schleswig-Holstein.
<br>I shall write and tell Laura to send you <i>The Free Press.</i> Your philistine on the spree lords it here as do, to an even greater extent, his better half and his female OFFSPRING. It is almost sad to see venerable Oceanus, that age-old Titan, having to suffer these pigmies to disport themselves on his phiz, and serve them for entertainment.
<br>BEST COMPLIMENTS from Jenny and Tussy. Life at the seaside suits both of them admirably. <i>Addio.</i>
<br>Moor

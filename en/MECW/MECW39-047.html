MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>London, 30 April 1852</p>
<p>28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Frederic,</p>
<p>You will receive at the same time as this letter a colossal parcel from America. Today I have also had a letter from Cluss, of which I give excerpts below, as I shall be needing it until next week.</p>
<p>Dronke has arrived here <i>sain et sauf</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I like him better than I had feared. He has grown taller and has broadened out as well. This has also made him more self-possessed. For the present he hob-nobs with Anschütz, who welcomed him with open arms. He is going to start up a small business, having contracted in Paris to sell cigar cases and purses over here. 10% commission. And, through Anschütz, he will at once acquire the necessary connections for this TRADE.</p>
<p>He tells me that the 'worthy' Techow has sent character sketches of us to Switzerland in which he roundly inveighs against us and you in particular. You have aroused the professional jealousy of the military, <i>et je pense</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> that one day you will justify <i>leurs pressentiments</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Further: from Geneva, Schily demanded that the gentlemen come to terms with us. This elicited an authoritative statement signed by Willich, Techow, Schapper and Schimmelpfennig in which, <i>inter alia</i>, it was pointed out that 1. there had been a complete break with this wholly impotent party; 2. there are police spies in our midst who have been reporting everything to the Prussian government.</p>
<p>I don't know whether I have already told you, or whether you heard during your stay here,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> that Messrs Kinkel <i>et</i> Co. possess a <i>mere</i> 3,000 dollars in cash <i>all told</i>, that all respectable people such as Löwe of Calbe have all withdrawn, that relations between Willich on the one hand and Kinkel and Reichenbach on the other are very strained, and that the whole dungheap is in process of disintegration.</p>
<p>You will receive the memorandum on Germany.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> Yesterday the curs held a meeting of guarantors here and elected a definitive committee. Mr Ruge wrote a letter of protest. Willich was not present. From the start Reichenbach refused to have anything more to do with the filthy business. The committee will be paid. Those elected are Kinkel, Willich (doubtful that he'll accept), Löwe of Calbe (will in any case refuse), Fickler, Ronge, Schütz of Mainz and one other. They will make up the total from out of their own midst. In his letter, Ruge attacks Kinkel as an agent of the Prince of Prussia<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> and a freemason.</p>
<p>Here is a passage from CIuss' letter: Huzel (not to be confused with Huzzelwitt), Cluss' friend, [present as a guarantor] at Kinkel's Cincinnati congress<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> writes and tells Cluss <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
<p>'Kinkel tried to floor me with <i>vulgar invective</i> against Marx and Engels. I succeeded in doing what I wanted, namely in cornering him so effectively that I shall have him at my mercy for some time to come. He tried to cover himself by obtaining my word of honour not to say anything about the incident or to write anything that would get him "into a stink"... In a letter to Anneke a certain Teilering scolds like a fishwife at Marx...'.</p>
<p>Cluss himself goes on:</p>
<p>'In New York, at the inimitable meeting which I reported in my last letter, the numerous gymnastic clubs constituted themselves a separate body and declared their support for my protest<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> and for Weydemeyer's article against Kinkel's memorandum!<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Apropos. I gave Bangya a few pen-sketches of the great German men in London for him to pass on to Szemere.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> This letter, I know not how, has been read to a German publisher without my name being mentioned. He is now asking for 'character sketches' of these gentlemen and, according to Bangya, is prepared to pay £25 for a few sheets. Anonymous or pseudonymous, of course. Well, <i>qu'en penses-tu?</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> We would really have to do a humorous piece of this kind together. I have some doubts. If you think I should take this crap on, you will have to make a compilation from my letters and anything else you have which may contain fragments on the peculiarities of these curs. At all events you would have to send me a few notes about Willich 'in action'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> and 'in Switzerland'.</p>
<p>Among the things I am sending you, you will find the draft of an advertisement for an illustrated book of battle reports by old Szerelmey. He wants it gingered up a little and done into English as an advertisement, in return for which he promises each of us a copy of his work. <i>Je crois que ça vaut la peine de faire un petit puff</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>As soon as I set eyes on Mr Carey's first work in print<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup> I foresaw that he would bring out an economic work on the 'harmony of interests'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Mais que dis-tu, mon cher</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup> to the fact that, in the <i>Janus</i> we sent you, Ruge seeks—and <i>how</i> he seeks, <i>mon Dieu</i>!—to appropriate communism as the latest product of his 'humanist thought'.</p>
<p>Have you read the cock-fight between Harney and Jones? If not, I shall send you their mutual philippics.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" id="cite_ref-18">[18]</a></sup> Both of them, the one voluntarily, the other involuntarily, descend to the level of German emigre polemics.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>Have you ever read more egregious nonsense than B. Bauer's article in the <i>Tribune</i>: 'The Decline of England'? The passage most characteristic of the incorrigible old theologian runs as follows:</p>
<p>'While the English Parliament has hitherto persecuted the Romish policy, and availed itself of the popular impulses for the establishment of its sovereignty— while, in the old Romish spirit, it has taken advantage of <i>internal domestic differences</i>, as for example, the <i>differences of High Church</i>, <i>of Scotch Presbyterianism</i>, and <i>of Irish Catholicism</i>, for the formation and development of its aristocratic art of Government, [...] it has now become a party to the Continental struggle between the peoples and the Governments, and it appears as the advocate for Constitutionalism at the very moment when that is approaching its undeniable downfall.'</p>
<p>If that's not champion drivel, I don't know what is.

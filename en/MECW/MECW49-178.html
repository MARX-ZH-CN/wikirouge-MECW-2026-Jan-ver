ENGELS TO FILIPPO TURATI</p>
<p>IN MILAN</p>
<p>London, 6 February 1892</p>
<p>122 Regent's Park Road, N.W.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p><i>Se io lo conosco,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> the illustrious Bovio?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <i>Ma dopo molti anni, dopo la vecchia Internationale,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> when I encountered his articles at every turn in Italian socialist literature. At the time, I used to read them, and the more I read the less clear they became — <i>ho capi nagott.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> To use his own words, <i>non ricordo tempo più confusionario</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> To make things worse, in the end I did not know which of the two of us, he or I, was the <i>confusionario</i>. However, on the whole, he is a good fellow, a pedant, it is true, but a generous and amiable one (which is never the case with our German pedants) and, as you say, a Victor Hugo type, a grandiose character, a man of broad views, who reconciles you with his personality, even if you fight the party which he supports. I quite understand that he should be idolised by your youth. If I were young, I would be mad about him, I would worship him, but unfortunately I am 71, not 17.</p>
<p>This is my answer. Naturally it is slightly touched with irony — without which I would be unable to communicate with him — but, I hope, it is a civil answer. Would you be so kind as to translate it into Italian?</p>
<p><i>Sempre suo</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>F. Engels

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">On 2 February 1892 Filippo Turati sent Engels an article by the Italian philosopher and political leader Giovanni Bovio published in<i> La Tribuna.</i> The article contained a critique of the first instalment of Engels' 'Socialism in Germany' (see present edition, Vol. 27, pp. 235-50) as printed by Turati in the socialist journal<i> Critica Sociale,</i> No. 2, 16 January 1892. Turati, editor of the journal, reproduced Engels' work in translation from its French version published in<i> Almanack du Parti Ouvrier. </i> Turati requested Engels to reply to Bovio's article. Engels wrote his counterblast in French (see 'Reply to the Honourable Giovanni Bovio', present edition, Vol. 27, pp. 270-72) and sent it with a covering letter to Turati. Turati's Italian translation of Engels' reply, endorsed by the latter in a letter to Turati of 13 February (see this volume, p. 356), was published in<i> Critica Sociale,</i> No. 4, 16 February 1892 under the title 'Federico Engels — Giovanni Bovio' and was reprinted by several Italian newspapers.</span>

ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester,] 27 January 1859</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>I look forward keenly to your communication. Meanwhile herewith some bits of Paris gossip.</p>
<p>Yesterday I wrote to Freiligrath about Kinkel, the pretext being provided by the good fellow himself. I had written to him about the matter of the bill, adding a few comments on the political and economic aspects of the international situation, and this inspired him to declare: 'The <i>Hermann</i> will undoubtedly be followed one day by a <i>Neueste Rheinische Zeitung.'</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>What led him to mention Kinkel's rag I cannot imagine, unless he hoped to induce me to speak my mind on the subject of Johann Gottfried,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>in which case he was not disappointed. I must say that his attempt to establish some sort of connection between ourselves and that rotten little paper annoyed me very much. The day before yesterday I tried twice to write him a letter,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>but it was too crude, I was too angry, so I left the thing over until yesterday. I treated <i>him</i> very decently, but Monsieur Gottfried with considerable asperity. I told him that Kinkel was exploiting him in order to establish his credentials as a poet, since his own literary fame, spuriously acquired as a result of his wife's importunate advertising, would not otherwise endure; that the <i>Hermann</i> had only served to increase the contempt I had always felt for this vacuous, affected, dandyish jackanapes, and that I'd not forgiven the 'cur' the dirty tricks which he had played on you and me in America and was too cowardly to admit.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>It was a three page letter; as I said, Freiligrath can have no complaint about the way I treated <i>him</i> but, indirectly and by reading between the lines, he will learn a great deal. I'm curious to see what he will do.</p>
<p>I have had another visitor in the person of a Wuppertal poet and distant relation<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>of mine; in London he made straight for Freiligrath, of course, who wrote saying that he seemed to be a nice chap. I replied that he was at any rate robust, healthy and neither vain nor affected—qualities which, modern German poets</p>
<p>being what they are, made up for a comparative lack of talent. Freiligrath told this chap that his salary was a thousand pounds.</p>
<p>I was terribly annoyed at Freiligrath's surreptitious introduction of the <i>Hermann</i> into his letter, but he'll never play another trick of that kind on me, you may be sure of that.</p>
<p>Many regards to your wife and children.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p>Just for a joke I enclose one of the rejected drafts of my letter to Freiligrath.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">In a letter to Engels that has not reached us Freiligrath probably wrote about  <i>the</i> projected publication of a new revolutionary newspaper which was to be a  sequel to the<i> Neue Rheinische Zeitung,</i> organ of the proletarian wing of the  democratic movement during the 1848-49 revolution in Germany. Freiligrath  seems to have given an incorrect interpretation of the trend of the future  newspaper as against that of the petty-bourgeois weekly<i> Hermann</i> which  Gottfried Kinkel began to publish on 1 January 1859.—370, 372</span>

This shows that after the 1848-49 revolution  the proletarian circles in the Rhine Province continued to regard Marx and  Engels as their leaders. Already during his first visit Levy maintained that an  uprising was needed in Germany and that the factory workers were ready for  it. Marx, then too, argued that, with reaction rampant in Germany, an uprising  would be premature, as would a resumption of the activities of the Communist  League in Germany urged by Levy.—25</span>

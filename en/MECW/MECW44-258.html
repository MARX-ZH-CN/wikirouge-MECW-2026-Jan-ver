ENGELS TO HERMANN JUNG</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[The Hague, early September 1872]</p>
<p>Dear Jung,</p>
<p>In the whole of financial year I find payments for rent<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>1871 October 31—Truelove
£7.7.— and two payments to Martin "5.—</p>
<p>£12.7.—</p>
<p>but <i>no</i> payments to Truelove on leaving the <i>old shop!</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Now this must have been paid—have you forgotten to enter it? Please write to the Hague to address on other side if this payment has been omitted on the books. I know last year at the Conference<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> we owed six months rent and now we owe none.</p>
<p>Yours fraternally,</p>
<p>F. Engels</p>
<p>Bruno Liebers</p>
<p>148 Jacob Catsstraat The Hague, Holland Note on inside of envelope that it is for me.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">On 19 July 1872 at the meeting of the General Council Executive Committee (Sub-Committee; see Note 435), Engels was instructed to prepare the financial report for the Hague Congress covering the period since the London Conference in September 1871. The report was read out by Engels at the Hague Congress sitting of 7 September 1872, and unanimously approved.

Marx and Engels arrived at The Hague to take part in the Congress on 1 September 1872. On 8 September they travelled to Amsterdam, where they took part in the meeting marking the closure of the Congress. Engels returned to London on 12 September, and Marx around 17 September 1872.

The Fifth Congress of the International Working Men's Association was held on 2-7 September 1872 in The Hague and attended by 65 delegates from 15 national organisations. Its decision to include in the General Rules (as Article 7a) the major tenet on the conquest of political power by the proletariat, and its resolutions relating to Administrative Regulations signified a victory for Marxism. The Congress took stock of the struggle Marx, Engels and their followers had waged for years against petty-bourgeois sectarianism in the workers' movement, in whatever guise it appeared, most notably against Bakuninism; Mikhail Bakunin and James Guillaume, the anarchist leaders, were expelled from the International. The resolutions of the Hague Congress laid the groundwork for the future formation of independent political parties of the working class on a national level.</span>

<p><i>To Engels in Manchester</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 2 August 1862</b></p>
<p>Dear Frederick,</p>
<p>Best thanks for the £10.</p>
<p>I very much dislike your being in financial difficulties on my account, but <em>que faire</em>? Who is capable of withstanding such a crisis as the American one? Not to mention my peculiar bad luck in having a rotten rag like the Vienna <em>Presse</em> to deal with. <b>Otherwise</b>, the fellows might, at least, have been able to make up for the loss of the <em>Tribune</em> <b>to some extent</b>. Do you suppose, perhaps, that the time has now come for me to approach, say, the <em>Evening Post</em> (<b>the Abolitionist paper</b> in New York) about my contributing to it?</p>
<p>All things considered, it's a real miracle that I have been able to get on with my theoretical writing to such an extent. I now propose after all to include in this volume an extra chapter on the theory of rent, i.e., by way of 'illustration' to an earlier thesis of mine. Let me say a word or two about <em>what will, in the text, be a lengthy and complex affair</em>, so that you may let me have your opinion on it.</p>
<p>As you know, I distinguish 2 parts in capital: <em>constant capital</em> (raw material, <em>matières instrumentales</em>, machinery, etc.),whose value only <em>reappears</em> in the value of the product, and secondly <em>variable capital,</em> i.e., the capital laid out in wages, which contains less materialised labour than is given by the worker in return for it. E.g. if the daily wage = 10 hours and the worker works 12, he replaces the variable capital + 1/5 of the same (2 hours). This latter surplus I <em>call</em> <b>surplus value</b>.</p>
<p>Let us assume that the <em>rate of surplus value</em> (that is the length of the working day and the surplus labour in excess of the necessary labour performed by the worker to reproduce his pay) is given, e.g. = 50 p.c. In this case, in a 12 hour working day the worker would work e.g. 8 hours for himself, and 4 hours (1/2) for the <b>employer</b>. And indeed, let us assume this to apply to all <b>trades</b> so that any variations there may be in the <b>average working time</b> simply allow for the greater or lesser difficulty of the work, etc.</p>
<p>In these circumstances, given <em>equal</em> exploitation of the worker in <em>different</em> <b>trades</b>, different capitals in different spheres of production will, given <em>equal size</em>, yield very different <b>amounts of surplus value</b> and hence very <em>different rates of profit,</em> <b>since profit is nothing but 'the proportion of the surplus value to the total capital advanced'</b>. This will depend on the <em>organic composition</em> of the capital, i.e., on its division into constant and variable capital.</p>
<p>Let us assume, as above, that the surplus labour = 50 p.c. If, therefore, e.g. £1 = 1 working day (no matter whether you think in terms of a day or a week, etc.), the working day = 12 hours, and the necessary labour (i.e. reproductive of the pay) = 8 hours, then the wage of 30 workers (or working days) = £20 and the value of their labour = £30, the variable capital per worker (daily or weekly) =£2/3 and the value he creates = £1. The <b>amount of surplus value</b> produced by a capital of £100 in <b>different trades</b> will vary greatly according to the proportion in which the capital of £100 is divided into constant and variable capital. Let us call <b>constant capital</b>, C, and <b>variable capital</b>, V. If, e.g. in the <b>cotton</b> industry, the composition was C 80, V 20, the value of the product would = 110 (given 50 p.c. surplus value or <b>surplus labour</b>). The amount of the surplus value = 10 and the profit rate = 10 p.c., since the profit = the proportion of 10 (the <b>surplus value</b>) : 100 (the total value <b>of the capital expended</b>). Let us suppose that, in a large tailoring shop, the composition is C 50, V 50, so that the product = 125, the surplus value (at a rate of 50 p.c. as above) = 25 and the profit rate = 25 p.c. Let us take another industry where the proportion is C 70, V 30, hence the product = 115, the profit rate = 15 p.c. Finally, an industry where the composition = C 90, V 10, hence the product = 105 and the profit rate = 5 p.c.</p>
<p>Here, given <em>equal exploitation</em> of labour, we have <b>in different trades</b> very <b>different amounts of Surplus Value and hence very different rates of profit</b> for capitals of equal size.</p>
<p>If, however, the above 4 capitals are taken together, we get:
</p>
<table align="center" style="margin-right: auto;" width="60%"><tbody><tr><td width="80%">
<table align="right" style="margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><em>Value of the product</em></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1. C 80 V 20</td><td>110</td><td>profit rate =</td><td>10 p.c.</td></tr><tr><td>2. C 50 V 50</td><td>125</td><td>profit rate =</td><td>25 p.c.</td></tr><tr><td>3. C 70 V 30</td><td>115</td><td>profit rate =</td><td>15 p.c.</td></tr><tr><td>4.

<p>On 1 00, this makes a <b>profit rate</b> of 13 3/4 p.c.</p>
<p>If the <em>total capital</em> (400) of the <em>class</em> be considered, the profit rate would = 13 3/4 p.c. And capitalists are brothers. As a result of competition (<b>transfer of capital or withdrawal of capital from one trade to the other</b>), capitals of <em>equal</em> size in <b>different trades, despite their different organic compositions, yield the same average rate of profit</b>. In other words, the <b>average</b> profit, which <b>F.I. a capital of</b> £100 yields <b>in a certain trade</b>, it yields, not as a capital specifically applied to the same nor, therefore, in the proportion in which it of itself produces <b>surplus value</b>, but as an <em>aliquot part</em> of the total capital of the capitalist class. It is a <b>share</b> of the dividend on which will be paid in proportion to its size out of the total amount of the <b>surplus value</b> (or unpaid labour) produced by the total variable (laid out in wages) capital of the class.</p>
<p>If then 1, 2, 3, 4 in the above illustration are to make the same <b>average profit</b>, each category must sell its goods at £ 113 1/3. 1 and 4 will sell them at <em>more than their</em> value, 2 and 3 at <em>less.</em></p>
<p>The price so regulated = <b>the expenses of capital</b>, + <b>the average profit</b> (<b>F.I.</b> 10 p.c.), is what Smith called the <b>natural price, cost price</b>, etc. It is the <b>average price</b> to which competition between <b>different trades</b> (by <b>transfer of capital</b> or <b>withdrawal of capital</b>) reduces the prices in <b>different trades</b>. Hence, competition reduces commodities not to their value, but to the <em>cost price,</em> which, depending on the organic composition of the respective capitals, is either <em>above, below</em> or = to their values.</p>
<p>Ricardo confuses <em>value</em> and <em>cost price.</em> He therefore believes that, if there were such a thing as <em>absolute rent</em> (i.e., rent <em>independent</em> of variations in the fertility of the soil), <b>agricultural produce</b>, etc., would be constantly sold for more than its value, because at more than cost price (<b>the advanced capital</b> + <b>the average profit</b>). That would demolish the fundamental law. Hence he denies absolute rent and assumes only differential rent.</p>
<p>But his identification of <b>values of commodities</b> and <b>cost prices of commodities</b> is totally wrong and has traditionally been taken over from A. Smith.</p>
<p>The facts are as follows:</p>
<p>If we assume that the <b>average composition</b> of all <b>not agricultural capital</b> is C 80, V 20, then the product (assuming that the rate of surplus value is 50 p.c.) = 110 and the profit rate = 10 p.c.</p>
<p>If we further assume that the <b>average composition of agricultural capital</b> is C 60, V 40 (in England, this figure is statistically fairly correct; rent for pasture, etc., has no bearing on this question, being determined not by itself, but by the <b>corn rent</b>), then the product, given equal exploitation of labour as above = 120 and profit rate = 20 p.c. Hence, if the farmer sells his <b>agricultural product</b>, for what it is <em>worth,</em> he is selling it at 120 and not at <em>110</em>, its <em>cost price.</em> But <em>landed property</em> prevents the farmer, like his <b>brother capitalists</b>, from equalising the <em>value</em> of the product to the <em>cost price.</em> Competition between capitals cannot enforce this. The landowner intervenes and pockets the <em>difference between value</em> and <em>cost price.</em> A low proportion of constant to variable capital is in general an expression of the poor (or relatively poor) development of the productive power of labour in a particular sphere of production. Hence, if the <b>average composition of agricultural capital</b> is e.g. C 60, V 40, while that of <b>not agricultural capital</b> is C 80, V 20, this proves that agriculture has not yet reached the same stage of development as industry. (Which is easily explicable since, apart from anything else, a prerequisite for industry is the older science of mechanics, while the prerequisites for agriculture are the completely new sciences of chemistry, geology and physiology.) If the proportion in agriculture becomes C 80, V 20 (in the above premise), then <em>absolute rent</em> disappears. All that remains is <em>differential rent</em>, which I shall also expound in such a way as to make Ricardo's assumption of the constant <b>deterioration of agriculture</b> appear <b>most ridiculous and arbitrary</b>.</p>
<p>Having regard to the foregoing definition of <b>cost price</b> as distinct from <b>value</b>, it should further be noted that, besides the distinction between constant capital and variable capital, which arises out of the <em>immediate production process</em> of capital, there is the further distinction between <em>fixed and circulating capital</em>, which arises out of the <em>circulation process</em> of capital. However, the formula would become too involved if I were to seek to incorporate this in the above as well.</p>
<p>There you have — <b>roughly</b>, for the thing's fairly complicated — the critique of Ricardo's theory. This much you will admit — that by taking into account the <b>organic composition of capital</b><em>,</em> one disposes of a mass of what have so far seemed to be contradictions and problems.</p>
<p>Apropos. There are certain reasons, of which I shall inform you in my next letter, why I should be <b>very glad</b> if you would write me a detailed military critique (I shall deal with the political aspect) of Lassalle-Rüstow's liberation nonsense.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.</p>
<p>Regards to the ladies.</p>
<p>Imandt has announced himself. Izzy leaves on Monday.</p>
<p>It will be evident to you that, given my view of 'absolute rent', <em>landed property</em> (<b>under certain historical circumstances</b>) does <b>indeed</b> put up the prices of raw materials. Very important, communistically speaking.</p>
<p>Assuming the correctness of the above view, it is <em>by</em> no means <em>essential</em> for <em>absolute rent</em> to be paid under all circumstances or in respect of <em>every type of soil</em> (even if the composition of <b>agricultural capital</b> is as assumed above). It is not paid when <em>landed property</em> does <em>not</em> exist, either factually or legally. In such a case, <b>agriculture</b> offers <b>no peculiar resistance to the application of capital</b>, which then moves as easily in this element as in the other. The agricultural produce is then sold, as masses of industrial products always are, <em>at cost price</em> for <em>less</em> than its value. In practice, <em>landed property</em> may disappear, even when capitalist and landowner are one and the same person, etc.</p>
<p>But it would be otiose to go into these details here.</p>
<p><em>Differential rent</em> as such — which does not arise from the circumstance that <b>capital</b> is employed <b>on land instead of any other field of employment —</b> presents no difficulty in theory. It is nothing other than <b>surplus profit</b> which also exists in every sphere of industrial production wherever capital operates under better than <b>average conditions</b>. It is firmly ensconced in agriculture only because founded on a basis as solid and (relatively) stable as the <b>different degrees of natural fertility</b> of various types of soil.

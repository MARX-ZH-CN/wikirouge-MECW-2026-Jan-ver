<br>Dear Comrade,
<br>I would ask you to convey to the Society my heartiest thanks for the kind message of greetings on my birthday. I hope that the Society, which has already outlived by four years its first half century, will also reach the 74 years which have been my lot, and then find enough strength and youthful vigour to complete a full century.
<br>Sincere greetings from
<br><i><b>Fr. Engels</b></i>

<div class="Publication">Written at the end of 1840 and the beginning of 1841 <br>First published in the book: Michael Knieriem, Friedrich Engels: Cola di Rienzi. Ein unbekannter dramatischer Entwurf, Trier, 1974<br>Published in English for the first time in Marx-Engels Collected Works, Volume 3</div>

<p>Note from MECW :
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This draft of the young Engels' verse drama Cola di Rienzi only became known after Volume 2, containing his early works, letters and literary experiments, had already gone to press. This draft is therefore being published in the present volume as a supplement, although chronologically it belongs to Volume 2.</p>
<p>The draft manuscript was discovered among the posthumous papers of the German poet Adolf Schults, a native of Elberfeld, by Michael Knieriem, director of Frederick Engels House in Wuppertal. Schults belonged to a group of Wuppertal writers and art-lovers which included many of Engels' fellow pupils from the Elberfeld high school who kept in touch with him during his residence (from July 1838 to March 1841) ;n Bremen, where he was gaining practical experience with a commercial firm and was also engaged in literary activities. Knieriem arranged the first publication of this drama in co-operation with Hans Pelger, director of Karl Marx House in Trier (see Michael Knieriem, Friedrich Engels: Cola di Rienzi. Ein unbehannter dramatischer Entwurf. Herausgegeben vom Friedrich-Engels-Haus, Wuppertal, und Karl-Marx-Haus, Trier, Trier, 1974). The draft was evidently intended for an opera libretto, as may be gathered from a letter of September 30, 1840, sent by Engels' schoolfriend Carl de Haas to Schults and other Elberfeld writers in which there is a reference to Engels' intention of writing the text of an opera at the request of one of his Elberfeld friends. This is also borne out by the style of the work, parts of which are specially adapted for performance (ducts, trios, and settings for chorus), and in which provision is made for the insertion of musical episodes. The draft was in all probability written between the end of 1840 and the beginning of 1841, since one page of the manuscript bears a short passage in Hebrew from the Old Testament which was also quoted in a letter of February 22, 184 1, from Engels to Friedrich Graeber (see MECW, Vol. 2, p. 526).</p>
<p>Engels took the plot for his drama from events in Rome in the middle of the 14th century — the struggle which developed between the feudal aristocracy on the one hand and the merchant and artisan population on the other. In May 1347, as a result of a popular uprising, a republic was proclaimed in Rome with "people's tribune" Cola di Rienzi at its head. With Rienzi, firm measures against the nobility and a desire to affirm the principle of popular sovereignty and achieve the unification of Italy were combined with fantastic notions about the restoration of ancient Rome's grandeur and world domination. Banished from Rome at the end of 1347 as a result of intrigues by the feudal magnates, Rienzi was reinstated in August 1354 with the aid of mercenary troops commanded by foreign condottieri. The people rose against Rienzi, however, resenting his despotic behaviour, his ambitiousness, and the increased tax burden, a measure which was forced on him by the costs of paying the mercenaries and conducting the war with the aristocrats. On October 8, 1354, an insurrection flared up against him and he was killed. The action in Engels' drama deals with the second period of Rienzi's rule.</p>
<p>The manuscript is a rough draft. In several places, there are author's corrections, erasures and additions in the margin. On one page, the initials "F. E." and Engels' signature are to be seen in the margin. Some drawings made by the author on several pages refer to the plot of the drama, while others are unconnected with it (there are also some cartoons). The last pages contain a variant of the beginning of Act One, Scene One (in the present edition, this has been printed after the corresponding first version and has been separated from it, as from the continuation, by a horizontal line).

<p><b>CAMILLA</b>
</p>
</center><p>Why that turmoil? What's the meaning Of that roaring mob out there;</p>
<p>All that raving, running, screaming, Bloody flags waved in the air?</p>
<p>And I hear a wild throng gathered At the palace steps: they're crying Out the name of my own father, Threatening and vilifying.</p>
<p>Will you escape, father, safe and sound From the crazed people that riot and swarm? Will Holy Mary, Protectress, look down Like a good star and preserve you from harm? Fear is upon me, black and ineffable, Father, all for your sake!</p>
<p>Spare me this suffering, dreadful, unbearable, Father, oh please come back!</p>
<p>All the servants, in their terror, Leaving me, have run away,</p>
<p>And I stand here white with horror In the palace on my own.</p>
<p>
But—Oh God! for here comes Walter— Heart, O heart, be still, I pray! — Now he sees me quail and falter, Through the gates he runs alone!</p><center>
<p>Enter Montreal.
</p>
</center><center>
<p><b>CAMILLA</b>
</p>
</center><p>By all the Saints in Heaven, Montreal, you dare— </p><center>
<p><b>MONTREAL (going down on his knees)</b>
</p>
</center><p>O Camilla! My Camilla!</p><center>
<p><b>CAMILLA</b>
</p>
</center><p>You dare set foot inside this house Denied to you forever by my father? Let him but meet you here, and from his sword Your life's in danger!</p><center>
<p><b>MONTREAL</b>
</p>
</center><p>Sweet lady, do you mind no more The love that bound us lastingly, The vows that by the stars we swore, The tears you used to shed for me?</p><center>
<p><b>CAMILLA</b>
</p>
</center><p>Leave me! O Saints, my poor heart Is bursting in my breast!</p><center>
<p><b>MONTREAL</b>
</p>
</center><p>Beloved, see the hectic fever
That drives the blood into my face. Am I now strange to you forever Who on your breast once found my peace?</p><center>
<p><b>CAMILLA</b>
</p>
</center><p>I must not look you in the eye, Being beholden to forswear you.
My wretched heart will break, but I, Alas, I must not dare come near you.</p><center>
<p><b>MONTREAL</b>
</p>
</center><p>O see me begging at your feet,</p>
<p>My only dearest love are you!</p>
<p>
But lock your heart against me, sweet, And Heaven locks its portals too! </p><center>
<p><b>CAMILLA</b>
</p>
</center><p>My breast is heaving up and down, From him I cannot stay apart.
Once more in true love's toils I'm bound. Walter—forever yours my heart!</p><center>
<p><b>BOTH</b>
</p>
</center><p>O true love's blessed victory!</p>
<p>No matter what else may conspire Against us, what can mar our sky When each belongs to each entire? Though we be shunned the whole world over, Our bond disparaged as a bane,</p>
<p>
If we do not desert each other, Indeed our star can never wane!</p><center>
<p><b>CAMILLA</b>
</p>
</center><p>But tell me, Walter, what arouses The mob on the streets to such violent rage? And, above all, my father, my father— Where is he?</p><center>
<p><b>MONTREAL</b>
</p>
</center><p>Fear not! Your father is in safety, Debating flight with the city nobles In the Orsinis' palace.</p>
<p>The Tribune approached; rejoicing, the people All went to meet him. Like lightning he moved, And, ere the nobles could guess what was happening, He stood at the gates of the city. Your father will soon be here with his trusted friends, To lead you from here to a place of safety. But look! his suite comes over there, With trumpets sounding, banners waving! Yes, I can see his silver hair!</p>
<p>
He comes, and so I must be leaving.</p><center>
<p><b>CAMILLA</b>
</p>
</center><p>My Walter, go away from me,
But for my love you need not fear. 1 shall yearn for you constantly, My heart shall ever hold you dear! </p><center>
<p><b>WALTER</b>
</p>
</center><p>My joy—until we meet again!
The Saints be with you—I will come Back to you, love, a nobler man, To carry you, my Princess, home! Great things to do some day I mean. My life on it: the time will come, I'll raise you to the throne as queen And you shall reign with me in Rome.</p><center>
<p><b>CAMILLA</b>
</p>
</center><p>My loving heart content would be If I were simply your poor wife. It were the height of bliss for me To serve you, body and soul, for life!</p><center>

I shall not rest, nor tarry,</p>
<p>Till Rome in all her ancient splendour, And in her ancient majesty,</p>

<p><b>Scene One</b></p>
<p>Palestrina. A chamber in Colonna's house. At the beginning, shots are heard from time to time.</p>
<p>Colonna, Camilla.
</p>
</center><center>
<p><b>CAMILLA</b>
</p>
</center><p>Father, for Jesus' sake, what is afoot? With anxious faces your friends are leaving, Deserting you; the besiegers' cannon Are thundering closer and fiercer than ever— Are we then lost, my father, oh tell me!</p><center>
<p><b>COLONNA</b>
</p>
</center><p>Camilla, be calm and listen.</p>
<p>The ambitious Orsini wanted</p>
<p>No more to obey me, the chosen leader, But stand beside me, give orders like me! I stuck to my rights;</p>
<p>The rift between us was irremediably wide. His son stepped forward. Fathers, said he, Be not divided in danger's hour, When unity is our foremost need.</p>
<p>I want to reunite you!</p>
<p>Give me, Colonna, your daughter in marriage. Long have I loved her, the fair Camilla. If, through your children, you are united By holy bonds,</p>
<p>Strife no longer shall split you asunder Over the power in the land.</p>
<p>Then his father spoke up as follows: So be it! But if you refuse, Colonna, Tomorrow I shall withdraw my troops And come to terms with the Tribune. Then try and hold the fortress alone! Those were his words. And so, my daughter, Even before the sun goes down You'll go—as I told him — to young Orsini And join him in wedlock. So make you ready.</p>

</p>
</center><p>You seem unwilling to give in.
I'd long intended that you should win A better thing on your brow to set Than Count Orsini's coronet. Whoever might your hand in marriage merit At least a princedom should inherit— Or so I thought. Things worked out differently. What choice have we?</p><center>
<p><b>CAMILLA</b>

<p><b>A</b> <b>SERVANT (entering)</b>
</p>
</center><p>My Lord, a stranger waits outside. He has important news to bring you, But only to you he'll give his name.</p><center>
<p><b>COLONNA</b>
</p>
</center><p>Let him come in!
(Exit servant. Enter Montreal in cloak and hat. He doffs his and flings back his cloak.)</p><center>
<p><b>CAMILLA</b>
</p>
</center><p>Oh Heavens! Walter!</p><center>
<p><b>COLONNA</b>
</p>
</center><p>Montreal! You dare to enter my house, You, whose soldiers besiege us now, You, that have taken the enemy's side, You, that have stolen my daughter's heart From me? What is your purpose here?</p><center>
<p><b>MONTREAL</b>
</p>
</center><p>Softly, dear sir, and listen to me! Do you remember, you turned me away When I was seeking Camilla's hand? 
Now I revenge myself, as befits a knight. My soldiers have you completely surrounded, Their guns rock Palestrina's towers. A sign from me, and the whole wild horde streams in, And then you are lost. For who will save you? Well, I will save you, if you so wish! Palestrina need not fall, and I shall lead you In pomp and ceremony back to Rome!</p><center>
<p><b>COLONNA</b>
</p>
</center><p>So you would treacherously leave the Tribune? That is hardly a knightly deed— I'll have no part in it at all.</p><center>
<p><b>MONTREAL</b>
</p>
</center><p>What treachery's here? My brothers, not I, Sent the troops to join the Tribune. I never sanctioned the deed at all. Who's to prevent me withdrawing my soldiers? That I'll do. This only I ask: Give me what I could anyway win for myself!</p><center>
<p><b>COLONNA</b>
</p>
</center><p>What do you want of me?</p><center>
<p><b>MONTREAL</b>
</p>
</center><p>In Romagna, in the March of Ancona Are thousands obedient to my word. I have no land, and yet I am</p>
<p>The most powerful man in Italy.</p>
<p>I come to you, and I demand:</p>
<p>
Agree to let me assume the title Of Roman Podestà and take your daughter As wife beside me on the Throne! (Colonna paces up and down in thought.)</p><center>
<p><b>CAMILLA</b>
</p>
</center><p>Did I not say he'd rescue us, Hearing that I was in distress? Did I not know he'd think of me
In times of danger or of stress?</p><center>
<p><b>MONTREAL</b>
</p>
</center><p>How could I ever desert my beloved Or my beloved's father in need?</p><center>
<p><b>COLONNA</b>
</p>
</center><p>So be it! I'll sacrifice Qrsini. He always envied me, being vain. He and his house may fall, but I shall rise My son, here is my daughterl She's yours! Be Podestà of Rome with her beside you! Camilla, past returning</p>
<p>Are hate and enmity.</p>
<p>
I have appeased your yearning, Look up, look up at me!</p><center>

<p><br>
</p>
</center><p>Curse the traitorsl For turning the people Away from me, for reviling me.</p>
<p>As if I'd fatten myself on the poor! Curse them! If only the people stay loyal, The future shall see me gloriously vindicated. My people all, for whom I've gladly Been cursed, reviled, imprisoned, banned, For whom I've braved the Tyrants, loudly Crying amongst them: Hold your hand! My people, you will not go under Shamed and abused, like cowards base; You shall arise in all your grandeur, A proud and a victorious race!</p>
<p>You know not the many trials, Cares and anguish I went through; You know not the many perils</p>
<p>That I faced because of you!</p>
<p>Long years, hesitating never, Through the thorns I struggled on, Yet you may not thank me ever</p>
<p>For the good that I have done!</p>
<p>But no! I wanted Rome to free</p>
<p>That fell, a victim to dissension. Restore her ancient dignity—</p>
<p>Is that no fine and great intention?</p>
<p>
O Ancient Rome, do but once show Yourself to me in your past might, And I have lived enough, can go Happy into the grave's dark night!</p><center>
<p><b>NINA (entering)</b>
</p>
</center><p>Oh Cola, tell me, is it true</p>
<p>That foes are plotting against you? Is danger hanging over</p>
<p>
The head so dear to me?</p><center>
<p><b>RIENZI</b>
</p>
</center><p>Calm yourself, my dearest wife.
A few power-seeking, envious ones, And Walter von Montreal, that traitor, Are stirring up the people against me, Hoping to bring about my downfall. Helped by God and a loyal people, 1 shall outwit the treacherous ones. Before they even sense the danger, Their heads will roll for their own crimes. How could these schemes of theirs unnerve me? Are they as strong as I am here, With my true-loving wife to serve me, And with my senses calm and clear?</p><center>
<p><b>NINA</b>
</p>
</center><p>Cola, why can't I put to flight The fears with which I am consumed? In dreams I've seen your face all white Since you the purple robe assumed.</p><center>

</p>
</center><p>My dearest wife, come, fear no more! We are not in the slightest danger; Untroubled can the eagle soar Clear of the snakes that hiss with anger.</p><center>

</p>
</center><p>I cannot think what I would do,</p>
<p>If I should lose you, love, one day.</p>
<p>Cola di Rienzi</p>
<p>Whoever left me without you,</p>
<p>
Would steal my very life away.</p><center>
<p><b>COLA</b>
</p>
</center><p>Oh, put aside all fear and care, For what inspires me is sublime.</p>
<p>I can't go under—do not dare— Until I have achieved my aim, Until Rome's might triumphantly</p>
<p>Is born again, and Freedom shakes The dust off, and the world can see In trembling how the lion wakes. If, in the heat of battle, I stood Alone, in peril of my life, Deserted and abandoned, would</p>

<p>Many-voiced, raging;</p>
<p>They're bursting through breaches And soon they will reach us.</p>
<p>Our palace they're nearing!</p>
<p>In wild agitation</p>

<p>Ye most blessed ones on high;</p>
<p>Let the angels' wings extend</p>

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN WATERLOO NEAR LIVERPOOL</p>
<p>[London,] 9 August 1857</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Today I am prevented from writing more than a few lines— just my best wishes for your recovery. My ANXIETY for your BODILY welfare is as great as if I myself were ill—greater, perhaps.</p>
<p>How are things in regard to 'coughing'? So far as I can judge from your letters, at least you're not much troubled with it.</p>
<p>My doctor, who has treated a great many CASES such as yours, says that if a patient's condition does not permit of his bathing in the sea, he has successfully prescribed washing all over in heated (TEPID) sea water, the temperature being gradually reduced.</p>
<p>Let me know whether you are taking iron. In cases such as yours, as in many others, iron has proved stronger than the affliction.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

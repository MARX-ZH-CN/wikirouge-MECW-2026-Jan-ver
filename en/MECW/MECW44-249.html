ENGELS TO ADOLF HEPNER<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>IN LEIPZIG
<br>London, 4 August 1872
<br>Dear Hepner,
<br>I was about to write a brief article for you on the latest Bakuninist affairs, when it developed that the General Council would have to make a statement on the matter itself. Thus the article has turned into an address,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> the German translation of which you will receive on Wednesday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <br>The latest Spanish documents may well serve as a supplement shortly.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> Bakunin retained the <i>Alliance de la démocratie socialiste,'<b><sup>10</sup></b></i><b> which you know of from the <i>Scissions,'</i></b><i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> </i> as a <i>secret</i> society in order to obtain control of the International. But we learned of this, and now we have the proof. Thus, the charge will now be made publicly, as otherwise the elections to the Congress in Spain<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> would be run by the Alliance and their outcome would be in its favour. Bakunin will break his neck in this affair.
<br>You will have received the reply to the <i>Concordia.</i><b><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> <i> So that is what the armchair socialists amount to! I had not thought that they could be as stupid as </i>that,<i> I had thought that the paper must be edited by someone like Beta-Bettziech.</i></b>
<br>The <i>factum</i> of Verdy was something I knew from the <i>Kölnische Zeitung,</i> but I did not know that the man was also a trickster.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> Very fine. That wretched Sonnemann, incidentally, regards every great historical event merely as an opportunity to change his lousy Frankfurt back into a free city of the Empire. And for this reason the Prussians must always serve as whipping-boy. According to our information, the preparations are being made on such a colossal scale that the Prussians can be defeated only if they are opposed by Austria, as well as France and Russia. But Austria will be <i>on</i> Prussia's <i>side,</i> unless some sudden change occurs, which is not to be expected in the circumstances. Moreover, we shall soon witness the diverting spectacle of William<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> issuing an appeal to the Poles and re-establishing some sort of Poland. And with this he, and the whole Prussian regime, will break their necks. The Prusso-German Empire is far from having reached its culminating point; this war (if it ends well, which is to be expected) will swiftly raise it to its climax, and then it will come tumbling down from the dizzy heights of Napoleonic glory. It is quite possible that <i>this time</i> the movement will start in Berlin; the contradictions are growing very acute there, and all that is required to bring things to a head is a change in the political situation. A Berlin revolution of that kind will certainly be pretty rough, but still it is better for it to come from within than after a Sedan, which only brings harm everywhere.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> <br>Hirsch must send to Switzerland for the following writings of Bakunin:
<br><i>Lettres à un français</i> (anonymous), Geneva 1871. <i>L'Empire knouto-germanique</i> by M. Bakounine, Geneva 1871. This is not obtainable from booksellers, I have tried it, but Boruttau will certainly get it for him since he is in raptures about it.
<br>Pass on my greetings to Liebknecht and Bebel when you next visit them.
<br>Best regards.
<br>Yours,
<br>F. E.

At the General Council meeting of 6 August 1872 the draft provoked a lively discussion, with some of the Council's members opposing publication of the address pending an investigation into the Alliance's activities. The draft proposed by Engels was accepted by a majority vote. The document has survived in Engels' handwriting in English and in French. It did not appear in <i>Der Volksstaat</i>.</span>

By early August 1872 Engels received from Spain a copy of Bakunin's letter to Mora of 5 April 1872, the statutes of the Alliance in Spain, and other documents. These materials were used by Engels when drafting the above-mentioned address of the General Council.</span>

At its next meeting on 18 June the Council decided on The Hague as the venue for the Congress and appointed a special commission (Engels, Edouard Vaillant, Joseph MacDonnel) to prepare an official announcement of the forthcoming Congress. The announcement was written by Engels and despatched to <i>The International Herald,</i> which published it on 29 June 1872 (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 170-73).</span>

Following the publication of Marx's reply in <i>Der Volksstaat, Concordia,</i> No. 27, 4 July 1872, featured another anonymous article (also written by Brentano), 'Wie Karl Marx sich vertheidigt'.

Ross, Valerian Smirnov). The letter, written on 4 October 1872, protested against Bakunin's expulsion from the International. It was printed by <i>La Liberté,</i> No. 41, on 13 October 1872.</span>

<p>In order to put a stop to all the false rumours and wild combinations that have been circulated with reference to the editorship of our paper, we must state that there has been, and will be, no change in the editorial personnel. The circle of our collaborators has, however, widened, and we are pleased to inform our readers that <i>Karl Marx, Frederick Engels, Ferdinand Freiligrath, W. Wolff, H. Heise</i>, and thus the most significant literary forces of our party, are determined to grant their support to <i>Das Volk</i> and, by their contributions, to enable the editorial staff to represent the interests of our party in a worthy and comprehensive manner.

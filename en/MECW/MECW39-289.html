MARX TO MORITZ ELSNER
<br>IN BRESLAU
<br>Manchester, 8 November 1855 34 Butler Street, Green Keys
<br>Dear Eisner,
<br>I have received both your letters,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> the first somewhat belatedly because my wife accidentally delayed sending it on to Manchester. After receiving your first letter I thought you had resigned from the <i>Neue Oder-Zeitung</i> and for that reason at once ceased to send any articles. When your second letter arrived I was suffering from such a FIT of toothache—which persisted until a few days ago—that I could no more write than I could hear or see.
<br>I passed on your letter of 7 October not only to friends but also to adversaries, and the latter seemed thoroughly taken aback. That I and my friends are in no way affected by the dogmas of Messrs Temme and Simon of Breslau you will readily believe without any further assurance from me.
<br>I do not see Hoyoll, but Lupus does—from time to time. Patriotism has led this Hoyoll to introduce the <i>Breslauer Zeitung</i> into the Athenaeum<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> here, a circumstance which threatens to drive our little Wolff<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> out of what is virtually the only home of the Muses in Manchester.
<br>I have conveyed your greetings to Borchardt, whom I know well. Borchardt maintains a regular and intimate correspondence with Citizen Simon of Breslau. Upon his first asking me whether I knew that the <i>N. O.-Z.</i> lived in sin with the constitutionals, I replied: <i><b>Qu'est ce que ça me fait</b>?</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> Don't you know that, in my view, constitutionals and democrats, at least of the Prussian variety, are all much of a muchness? And is a distinction now to be drawn between democrats who have accepted one royal imposition while rejecting another and those who, having submitted to the one, also submit to the other?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> The <i>N. O.-Z.</i> expresses the most extreme views possible in the present condition of the Press. What more do you ask?'
<br>I have had letters from particularly well-informed people in Paris. According to them, the Empire's stock is sinking lower and lower. In the <i>faubourgs</i> the slogan, <i><b>Celui-ci s'en ira</b></i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> is said to be on everyone's lips. Indeed, the gravity of the situation may be deduced from two PUBLIC FACTS: the speech made by Rouland, the <i>procurateur-général</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> and Granier de Cassagnac's article in the <i>Constitutionnel</i>, <b><i>Sur les terreurs de la</i> Révolution future<i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> The probability of the latter is beyond doubt even to Mr Granier.</i></b>
<br>As for the scandal here over the 'refugee question' (Jersey, etc.), there's more smoke to it than fire.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> PUBLIC OPINION has definitely turned against the GOVERNMENT and, in fact, I believe that this was <i>allowed for</i> in the latter's calculations. So crassly, with such tragi-comical mouthings, did they accede to Bonaparte's first demands, as virtually to demonstrate that further concessions were not within the power of an English government. Had they been in earnest, they would have shown themselves more adroit and not have carried out the grotesque coup so long before the opening of Parliament. Palmerston, OF COURSE, has no love for the refugees, but regards them as wind-bags to be kept to hand so that he may occasionally threaten the Continent with a <i><b>Quos ego'</b>!</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> His ministerial position, by the by, is exceedingly precarious. But it will still be difficult to unseat the old fox.
<br>When you next write, kindly send your letter to my old address, 28 Dean Street, Soho, London, since I don't know how long I shall be remaining here, and letters sent to the above address will in any case come into the hands of my wife. Ronge is running kindergartens in London along with his wife; Kinkel, no less than Johanna,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> hopes that the revolution will not be unduly precipitate; in Brighton, Ruge gives an occasional lecture, leading the English to believe that the German language is the most debased of all; Tausenau, Meyen <i>et tutti quanti</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> abuse the French emigre 'riff-raff (not excluding Victor Hugo) for imperilling the 'right of asylum' of these 'officially authorised conspirators'.
<br>Engels and Lupus send you their warmest regards. I haven't seen Borchardt for a fortnight.
<br>Yours
<br>K. M.

MARX TO FERDINAND LASSALLE
<br>IN DÜSSELDORF
<br>Manchester, 8th November 1855 34 Butler Street, Green Keys
<br>Dear Lassalle,
<br>Herewith a very belated answer. In the first place, I did not get your letters<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> until later because I was in Manchester whereas the letters were in London and my wife did not know for certain whether I hadn't already left Manchester. For another thing, I was plagued by the most atrocious toothache, so much so that I experienced what Hegel demands of sensual consciousness at the stage at which it is said to override consciousness of self—viz. the inability to hear, see, and therefore also to write.
<br>As regards your query about the book entitled: <i>Les mystères de la Bourse</i> by Coffinières, I believe that this miserable concoction is still among the books I left behind in the fatherland. During my first stay in Paris<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup> the title misled me first into buying the thing and then into reading it. Mr Coffinières is a lawyer who, <i>au fond</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup> knows nothing about the Bourse and merely warns against the 'legal' swindles perpetrated by the <i><b>agents de change'</b>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup> So there's nothing to be got out of the book—neither FACTS, nor theory, nor yet even entertaining anecdotes. Moreover, it is now completely out-of-date. 'Sweet Donna, let him go'—i.e. Coffinières. 'He is not worthy of thy wrath'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup> </i>
<br>Weerth is now back in Manchester after a lengthy journey via the Continent (he returned from the West Indies at the end of July). In a week's time he will be off to the tropics again. It's very amusing to hear him talk. He has seen, experienced and observed much. Ranged over the better part of South, West and Central America. Crossed the Pampas on horseback. Climbed Chimborazo. Likewise stayed in California. If he no longer writes feuilletons,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" id="cite_ref-18">[18]</a></sup> he makes up for it by recounting them, and his audience has the benefit of vivacious gesture, mime and waggish laughter. He is, by the by, full of enthusiasm for life in the West Indies and hasn't a good

The further strengthening of the reaction led in April 1849 to the dissolution of the Second Chamber elected on the basis of the 1848 Constitution, to the replacement of universal suffrage with a three-class electoral system based on a high property qualification and to the introduction of a new, still more reactionary Constitution which came into force on 31 January 1850</span>

ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester,] 4 July 1866</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>The other half of the note enclosed. Unfortunately, your telegram reached me <i>after 12 o'clock</i> so that I could not make use of the first post.</p>
<p>What do you say to the Prussians? Their initial successes were exploited with enormous vigour, and, if it had not been for this intensity, Benedek would probably have quietly withdrawn to Olmütz,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>but he was obviously forced to come to battle yesterday, and there could be no doubt about the issue after what had befallen. To determine the outcome of such a decisive battle in 8 hours is quite unprecedented; in other circumstances, it would have lasted 2 days.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>But the needle-gun is a merciless weapon, and then these fellows really do fight with a verve that I have never before observed in such peace-time troops. For the defender, the attacker's need to take positions by storm compensates for his superiority in weapons, and here too the Prussians appear to have accomplished a great deal. Benedek, with his deep 'plan', turns out to have been not merely a jackass but a dullard as well. How splendidly he could, with sufficient men, have caught those fellows in the mountains!</p>
<p>At all events, Bismarck will now try to set up his Imperial Germany, and that should include Bohemia, which he hopes to take from the Austrians and thereby establish a link between Silesia and Bavaria. In the treaty with Italy, he did after all stipulate <i>un territoire autrichien équivalent à la Vénétie</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Berlin is again acting with the vileness for which it is famed and yesterday even went so far as to elect a whole load of ministers. What will those camels of men of Progress say now?</p>
<p>The farce up in the North-West is delightful and will probably soon be no less so in the South, too.</p>
<p>The only safeguard against the betrayal that Bismarck has plotted with Bonaparte is the quite unexpected magnitude of the victories. He will now find it difficult to cede much, and the Belgians will probably have to pay part of the price.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Kindest regards to the LADIES.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

The battle of Sadowa resulted in grave defeat for the Austrian forces. It is also known as the battle of Königgrätz.</span>

In the course of the negotiations, wishing to secure France's neutrality in the war against Austria which was being prepared by him, Bismarck sought to make Napoleon believe that the war would be extremely exhaustive for Prussia and hinted vaguely at the possibility of territorial expansion for France at the expense of Belgium and Luxemburg, as well as certain German territories on the Rhine.</span>

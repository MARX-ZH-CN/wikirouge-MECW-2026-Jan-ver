MARX TO WILLIAM CYPLES<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>IN SHEFFIELD</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London,] 22 July 1856</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I write again myself to show that I bear not the least ill will against you for which, indeed, there would be no cause. In your</p>
<p><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>letter d.d. July 19,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> you say: 'It could not be satisfactory etc' Now as to my own satisfaction please to leave it altogether out of the question. As to Mr Ironside's 'satisfaction' I'll quote you the exact words of his 'note'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> Having told you, that already the first article had <b>overdosed</b> him, he continues as follows:</p>
<p>'They' (Dr Marx's articles) 'are entombing the paper. This must not be. <i>They must be brought to a close forthwith.</i> You must not have more than two more doses—this week and the next. You had better write him at once <i>to that effect.'</i></p>
<p>I <i>positively</i> decline making myself guilty of manslaughter by administering another 'dose' to Mr Isaac Ironside and 'entombing' him in the sheets of his own paper.</p>
<p>Yours etc.</p>
<p>Dr K. M.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">This letter was written in reply to one from William Cyples, a member of the  <i>Sheffield Free Press</i> staff, which Marx reproduced, together with his reply, in a  letter to Engels on 28 July 1856. Marx's relations with the newspaper had been  complicated by the arbitrary changes made by the editors in his<i> Revelations of  the Diplomatic History of the 18th Century,</i> which soon led him to stop publication  of the work in this paper (see Note 61).  The letter was first published in English as part of Marx's letter to Engels of  28 July 1856 in<i> Der Briefwechsel zwischen F. Engels und K. Marx. 1844 bis 1883. </i> Herausgegeben von A. Bebel und Ed. Bernstein. Verlag von J. H. W. Dietz,  Bd. II, Stuttgart, 1913.—58, 62</span>

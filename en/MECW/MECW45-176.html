ENGELS TO MARX<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Ramsgate, 19 July 1877<br>
2 Adelaide Gardens</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>I too shall write to Wiede<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> saying that, owing to lack of time, I can make no promises, let alone keep them. Unfortunately one cannot give the true, or rather intrinsic, reasons which you so rightly adduce. Besides—what do we know about Mr Wiede's ability to run a scientific review? Or even—on crucial occasions, of which surely there will shortly be more—about his reliability or merely his good will?</p>
<p>Herewith the latest from Wilhelm.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> As regards the manuscript,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> all I told him in my reply was that I would send the letter to you.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>While in the <i>cachot</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> he actually polished off three complete articles which appear in Nos. 80 and 81 of the <i>Vorwärts</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> Pitiable prevarication, a splendid example of how he would paraphrase your <i>Critique of the Programme</i>, turning it into a glorification of the same. I rebuffed his request for an article on the war, saying I had no wish to compete for space in the <i>Vorwärts</i> with the worthy socialists of the future, or to give further cause for clamorous protests that I fill the paper with abstruse stuff of no interest to the bulk of the readers, who evidently prefer fantasy to fact.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>It's only a pity that our people in Germany have such lamentable opponents. If there were, on the bourgeois side, just one competent man with a knowledge of economics, he would soon put these gentlemen in their places and open their eyes to their own confusion. But what can be the upshot of a battle in which the only weapons on either side are commonplaces and philistian drivel! As a counterpart in Germany to the learned bourgeois noddle, a new German vulgar socialism is evolving that is a worthy successor to the old 'true socialism' of 1845.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Turks will have to hurry if the affair is to turn out satisfactorily. Should they allow the Russians in Bulgaria and on the southern slopes of the Balkans to establish a quadrilateral of <i>Russian</i> fortresses,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> the situation might become chronic there, and in that case a thrust towards Constantinople would not be impossible, i.e. one having an eye to the purely <i>moral</i> effect as in 1828—or to treachery. And treachery would seem to be quite on the cards. That treachery there was at Nikopol—otherwise of no great importance <i>after</i> the Russian crossing—seems clear to me. Never before have 6,000 Turks, with a ditch and wall in front of them, surrendered without assault—except at Varna in 1828.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> I get quite nervous, what with the newspapers arriving twice a day and bringing news of the Russians' activity and the unfailing inaction of the Turks; it was no worse than this even in 1828 when there was <i>no</i> Turkish army at all.</p>
<p>You really ought to go and see Gumpert and get him to give you something for your insomnia; he's still there and the trip will do you good. Don't let the thing go too far this time—I imagine you will be going to Karlsbad again in the middle of August, and until then you have a month which you would surely do better to spend in decent health. Things aren't going too well here either.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> Since yesterday, for no apparent reason, Lizzie has been extremely unwell; the magic powers of sea-bathing have failed her for the first time and I'm beginning to get seriously alarmed.</p>
<p>Kindest regards to your wife, Tussy and Lenchen as well as the Longuets and Lafargues and yourself from us all.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

The proposal was made by Johann Most and Julius Vahlteich. August Bebel proposed that Engels' work appear as a separate edition rather than in the <i>Vorwärts.</i> Referring to the resolution of the 1876 congress concerning the publication of Engels' articles, Wilhelm Liebknecht suggested that they should be carried either by the scientific supplement to the <i>Vorwärts</i> or in the <i>Zukunft</i> magazine, or as separate pamphlets. Parts II and III of <i>Anti-Dühring</i> appeared in the supplement to the Vorwärts.</span>

The 'true socialists'—Karl Grün, Moses Hess, Hermann Kriege and others—indulged in the sentimental preaching of love and brotherhood and of pseudo-socialist ideas, and denied the need for political action and a revolution. Marx and Engels criticised this trend of the reactionary German petty bourgeoisie particularly in <i>The German Ideology</i> (see present edition, Vol. 5), in the <i>Circular Against Kriege, German Socialism in Verse and Prose,</i> and also in the <i>Manifesto of the Communist Party</i> (Vol. 6).</span>

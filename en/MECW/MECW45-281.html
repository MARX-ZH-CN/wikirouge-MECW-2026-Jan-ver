ENGELS TO JOHANN PHILIPP BECKER
<br>IN GENEVA
<br>London, 24 September 1879
<br>Dear Old Man,
<br>Your postcard<sup>a</sup> received. I have taken out a money order for £1 12s. which should come to 40.20 francs, so that you won't be in a hole if the cost of the power of attorney b amounts to a bit more. Marx is back,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> apparently in the very best of health, so no doubt work on the 2nd volume of <i>Capital</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> can now go briskly ahead.
<br>As regards the progress of negotiations with our people in the land of the philistines, I shall let you have further news in due course.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <br>In haste — Your old friend,
<br>F. E.

He returned to London on 17 September.</span>

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Following the publication of Part One of <i>A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</i> in 1859 (see present edition, Vol. 29), Marx wrote a lengthy economic manuscript in 1861-63. It was a second rough draft of <i>Capital</i> (the first being the 1857-58 manuscript). In 1863, he definitively decided that the work was to have four books, the first three being theoretical, and the fourth, presenting a historical and critical survey. In August 1863, having completed work on the manuscript of 1861-63, Marx began preparing <i>Capital</i> for the press. This work resulted in a third rough draft of <i>Capital</i>—the Economic Manuscript of 1863-65, consisting of three theoretical books. The draft for the fourth book <i>(Theories of Surplus Value)</i> formed part of the 1861-63 manuscript. Subsequently, Marx returned to the first book. On Engels' advice, Marx decided it would be the first to be published, and was preparing it for the press throughout 1866 and the first half of 1867. The first German edition of the book appeared in September 1867 as Volume One of <i>Capital.</i> Under the plan agreed with the publisher Otto Meissner, the second and third books, analysing the process of circulation of capital and the forms of capitalist process as a whole, were to appear as Volume Two, and the fourth book, dealing with 'the history of economic theories', as the third and final volume of <i>Capital.</i> Marx, however, did not manage to prepare the second and third volumes of <i>Capital</i> for the press. After his death, Engels completed the work and published Marx's manuscripts of the second and third books as Volume Two (1885) and Volume Three (1894). Engels also intended to prepare for the press and publish the above-mentioned manuscript of the fourth book as Volume Four of <i>Capital</i> but died before this plan had been carried out. In the present edition of the <i>Collected Works</i> of Marx and Engels, this book of <i>Capital</i> has been included in the Economic Manuscript of 1861-63 (vols 30-34), while the first three volumes of <i>Capital</i> make up vols 35-37 respectively.</span>

<li id="cite_note-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-3">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">This refers to the preparations for the publication of the illegal newspaper <i>Der Sozialdemokrat</i> in Zurich, the new central printed organ of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany. The need for such a newspaper emerged after a ban on the entire party press, above all the <i>Vorwärts,</i> following the introduction of the Anti-Socialist Law in October 1878 (see Note 462). In July-September 1879, extensive correspondence on the political line of the new paper and its editors was maintained between August Bebel, Wilhelm Liebknecht, Louis Viereck (in Leipzig), Carl Hirsch (in Paris), Eduard Bernstein, Karl Höchberg, Carl August Schramm (in Zurich), and Marx and Engels (in London). The campaign Marx and Engels conducted for a sound political line of the party's future central printed organ is fully expounded in their Circular Letter to August Bebel, Wilhelm Liebknecht, Wilhelm Bracke and Others of 17-18 September 1879 (see this volume, pp. 394-408).</span>

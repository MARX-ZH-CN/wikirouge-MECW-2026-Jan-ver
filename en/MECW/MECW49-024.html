ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE</p>
<p>AT LE FERREUX</p>
<p>London, 26 September 1890</p>
<p>My dear Löhr,</p>
<p>Yesterday we celebrated your impending birthday by a bottle of good claret, and to-day we shall drink, in honour of the real event, a bottle of champaign and wish you many happy returns of the day, hoping that you have only arrived</p>
<p><i>nel mezzo del cammin delta tua vita.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>As a birthday present herewith your share in Meissner's remittance of £45, just to hand, in shape of a cheque for £15; it comes very ap- propriate!</p>
<p>The last No. of the <i>Sozialdemokrat</i> is creating a stir here — Edward yesterday had a long extract in <i>The Daily Chronicle,</i> and is to inter- view E. Bernstein for Monday's <i>Star</i> (with photograph).</p>
<p>Meissner has not yet sent the account, only the remittance, so further particulars must be delayed.</p>
<p>Love from Nim, Schorlemmer and yours ever</p>
<p>F. Engels</p>
<p>Next time you come here you will be able to have a hot bath in the house. The old Marquis<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>died some time ago and the estate has gone into the hands of other agents, so I <i>posais la question du cabinet</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>and gave notice unless a new kitchen range and a new bath with hot wa- ter arrangements was put in. To-day the people have been here to look at the premises and I am informed that these demands of mine will be complied with. Of course there may be some little difficulty yet, but from what I hear I believe that I have carried my point.</p>
<p>The box of pears has not arrived yet, up to 3 p. m. to-day, but very likely it will be here before dinner.

ENGELS TO PASQUALE MARTIGNETTI</p>
<p>IN BENEVENTO</p>
<p>London, 21 May 1887</p>
<p>Dear Citizen Martignetti,</p>
<p>I'm glad to be able to inform you that my efforts on your behalf have not been entirely unsuccessful.<sup>8</sup> Johannes Wedde, editor of the (soc.) <i>Bürger-Zeitung</i> in Hamburg, has written to me as follows:</p>
<p>'A businessman here (cotton firm), who is a personal friend of mine and has no political prejudices, may <i>perhaps</i> have an opening for Martignetti, though only a modest one to begin with. However he would like Martignetti to send a photograph first. I find this rather odd—as does my friend himself—but it is necessary on practical grounds. It would be a good idea if the photograph were sent to this gentleman by Martignetti in person, together with a letter of recommendation. His name is Johannes Paul, of the firm of Paul &amp; Steinberg, Alterwall 58.'</p>
<p>So if you want to find out whether a post is available there, you would be well-advised to send Mr Paul your photograph. Overleaf is the draft of a letter for you to send him, worded in conformity with German commercial usage. I would remind you not to engage in any overt political activity while in Hamburg, because if you do you will certainly be expelled. The position of socialists in Germany gets worse every day and further coercive legislation is in the offing. On the other hand this may give you a chance to find an opening in commerce and thus embark on a new career.</p>
<p>My eye seems to be getting better at last. But I can't yet turn my mind to serious work, so your manuscript<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> is still in abeyance.</p>
<p>With kindest regards,</p>
<p>Ever yours,</p>
<p>F. Engels</p>
<p>To Johannes Paul, Hamburg.</p>
<p>I was pleased to learn through Mr Joh. Wedde that there is a prospect of my securing employment with your esteemed firm but that you would like to see my photograph first. I enclose same herewith and would mention that for the past <i>(il numéro degli anni</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <i>)... years I have been employed in the Royal Notary's Office here. I should be greatly obliged if you would be so good as to furnish me with particulars of the work I should be required to do and of any other conditions. Were the prospect of this post to materialise, I should gladly do all in my power to discharge my new duties in accordance with your wishes. With sincere thanks for your sympathetic interest.</i></p>
<p>I am, Sir,</p>
<p>Your obedient servant,
P.M.</p>

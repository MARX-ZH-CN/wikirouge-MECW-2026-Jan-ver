ENGELS TO PYOTR LAVROV</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>[London,] 20 October 1885</p>
<p>My dear Lavrov,</p>
<p>Greatly to my annoyance I am unable to help you with sources for a history of Chartism. 452 All my papers, books, journals, etc., which date back to that period went astray during the upheavals of 1848-49. The chief source, <i>The Northern Star,</i> is nowhere to be found, even in the north of England (Harney, its former editor-in-chief, is seeking in vain to get hold of a set). What the bourgeois have written on the sub- ject is for the most part false; nor have I ever concerned myself with such literature. It's unfortunate, for if Harney doesn't write his memoirs, the history of the first great workers' party will be lost for ever. 4 5 3</p>
<p>Yours ever and with regret,</p>
<p>F.E.

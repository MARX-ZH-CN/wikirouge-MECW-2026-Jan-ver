<blockquote>
<br>The <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> No. 203, January 24, 1849, carried an item "'My Army' in Cologne" dealing with the outrages committed by the Prussian soldiery. At the end of it a question was put to Colonel Engels, the second commandant of Cologne, whether he had really replied to the demands of the owners of houses destroyed by the soldiers that "in one of those houses 11 talers were stolen from a soldier" and that therefore he believed that "not enough by a long chalk has been done to these houses by the soldiers".

</blockquote>
<br><em>Cologne,</em> We have received from Colonel Engels the following answer to our question of two days ago.

<blockquote>
<br>"To the insertion in No. 203 of the <em>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</em> the answer is No.<br>"Only private persons have permitted themselves to express the opinion, unlawful in my view, that not enough by a long chalk has been done to these houses by the soldiers.<br>"<em>Cologne,</em> January 24, 1849
<br><em>Engels</em>, Colonel,<br>2nd Commandant
<br>"To the esteemed editors of the <em>Neue Rheinische Zeitung.</em>"

</br></br></br></blockquote>
<br>We will very likely have new questions to put to Herr Engels in the next few days, and particularly about the elections.

ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 4 April 1869</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>What are Applegarth and Odger thinking of, lending themselves to Lloyd Jones as partners and directors of the planned <i>Citizen Newspaper?</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>And how has Lloyd Jones suddenly managed to establish his position as a LEADER? For he is supposed to become the editor of this 'oh-so educated'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>worker-petty-bourgeois paper. The sooner I get information about this, the better, as that jackass Kyllmann is hawking the prospectus around here.</p>
<p>Yesterday we finally achieved the long-planned transfer of my official headquarters from Dover STREET to 86 Mornington STREET,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>to the great pleasure of Lizzie, who also went out again for the first time yesterday.</p>
<p>You have not told me what news you have about Löhrchen's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>health.</p>
<p>Best greetings.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p>Since you obviously have not discovered what <i>snieuntojown</i> means, I shall tell you: Saturday evening.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>But how? That is now the question.

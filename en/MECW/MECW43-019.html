ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 15 May 1868</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>You will probably have heard that Siebel died on the 9th inst. My mother wrote me that shortly before he had told his wife she should go to bed, which she did; suddenly she could no longer hear his breath, jumped up and found him dead. I am sending you 2 notices from his wife, one of which I ask you to send to Freiligrath.</p>
<p>Enclosed 6 prints of Lupus'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> photograph. Further something about Kobes'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> present activities. Have you read about the Ebergenyi trial?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Chorinsky's letters are in fact unparalleled. One can see that the Austrians are still awaiting their 1789. I shall send you the relevant <i>Zukunft</i> this evening. The Ebergenyi woman is said to receive masses of visitors in her 'convict prison' with a cigarette in her mouth and as merry as a cricket.</p>
<p>Best greetings.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p>Apropos. The articles in the <i>Fortnightly</i> are <i>all signed.</i> If this is the <i>rule,</i> it would be most unfortunate, since then it would be easy to see through the business. In any case, I would have to know if the article <i>must</i> be signed, for this would change the formulation a lot, and know right away for I have reached the stage where I can start.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> What is your answer to these questions?

Baroness Julia Ebergenyi, mistress of Count Chorinsky, was charged with the murder of Chorinsky's wife. The letters from Chorinsky to Ebergenyi, which featured as evidence at the trial, gave reason to suspect Chorinsky of complicity.</span>

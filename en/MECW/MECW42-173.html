ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 12 July 1866</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>I have written about your history to Gumpert, who is in Wales; as I do not know his address, the letter will first have to go to his home here, hence certainly some delay. As soon as I have a reply, I'll write to you, but meanwhile I should advise you to take arsenic <i>at once</i> and put off everything else, so as to stop the damned carbuncle. Put an end to <i>this</i> abomination at any cost.</p>
<p>Bonaparte's little plan and his intervention are in part probably a consequence of an earlier agreement with Bismarck, but certainly also—the new Confederation of the Rhine, etc.—are threats in his direction. But how the fellow can be so stupid as to make <i>this</i> plan public is beyond my comprehension<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>: as with Schapper—that he could be <i>so</i> stupid, etc.— It will assuredly drive the whole of South Germany into the arms of the Prussians and even the old philistines at the Exchange here are quite beside</p>
<p>themselves about it. One old man from Frankfurt told me: it's worth more to the Prussians than a reinforcement of 100,000 men.</p>
<p>You see how the stupid South Germans are letting themselves be picked off one by one without even taking the trouble to close ranks.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>It'll soon be the old, old story, we've been betrayed, we'll be led like lambs to the slaughter!<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>1849 all over again. I feel sorry for the fellows, they're good soldiers. Only now does one understand how the French were able to score such successes against the 'Empire', but <i>not</i> how the Empire was able to hold out for so long against a concentrated monarchy like France.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>I will try and produce the stuff about the mass-murder-industry for you.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many regards.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

According to the project, an independent South German Confederation was to be formed, consisting of states lying south of the Main, similar to the former Confederation of the Rhine. In this way Napoleon III hoped to prevent the unification of Germany and to subordinate South German states to his protectorate.<br>The<i> Confederation of the Rhine</i> (Rheinbund)—a confederation of states in Southern and Western Germany that was formed in July 1806 under the protectorate of Napoleon I. Napoleon's creation of this military and political stronghold in Germany was made possible by his defeat of Austria in 1805. Initially the Confederation incorporated sixteenth states (Bavaria, Württem berg, Baden and others), and later on another five states (Saxony, Westphalia, and others), which virtually became vassals of France. The Confederation fell apart in 1813, after the defeat of Napoleon's army.</span>

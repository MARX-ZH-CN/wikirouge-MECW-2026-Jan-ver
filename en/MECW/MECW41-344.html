<p>Dear Mr Engels,</p>
<p>Another proof-sheet [of <i>Herr Vogt</i>] has just arrived, which Moor must look over at once and send back to the City. He has therefore asked me to tell you — in haste, as the last post goes soon — that the highly welcome £5 note has been safely received.</p>
<p>With warm regards from us all.</p>
<p>Yours,<br>Jenny Marx

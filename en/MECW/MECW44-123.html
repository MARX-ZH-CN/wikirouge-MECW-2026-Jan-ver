ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN BRIGHTON</p>
<p>London, 23 August 1871</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>In great haste. Enclosed B/57 68868, London, 27 July 1871, £5. Stay there as long as you can; it will do you more good than to come here. The girls won't be coming this week after all.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the <i>Pall Mall</i> Lafargue too is at liberty.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lessner says that the Lassalleans have resolved to sue you if they do not receive the money next week!<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Frankel is here and was elected a member of the GENERAL COUNCIL yesterday, along with Chalain and Bastelica. He was here today with Rochat; does not seem to be a high-flyer.</p>
<p>Allsop was in the COUNCIL yesterday and gave me the sum of 5 shillings for you for the refugees. He is leaving town once more and will be writing to you again. In the crush there was of course no chance to speak with the deaf man in more detail.</p>
<p>Jung's letter saying that I should launch an appeal to the Yankees came yesterday at 7 p.m., i.e. too late. It was resolved that you should be charged with formulating the appeal<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> and despatching it by STEAMER next Saturday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> If you can't, I could do something of the sort; the enclosed letter proves that it would be worth it. Yesterday between £2 and £3 came in altogether!</p>
<p>The whole meeting<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> was used once more for the following debate: Weston, Hales, Applegarth and another of our Englishmen had been invited by George Potter to a meeting at which Dr Engländer (!) was also present. Potter produced the information that Sir Edward Watkin had made an agreement with the Canadian government according to which the Versailles prisoners would be sent to Canada where they would each be given 1 ACRE of land—presumably Thiers is behind it in order to get rid of them. Weston was enthusiastically in favour, <i>il radote de plus en plus</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> In the end Longuet, Theisz and Vaillant moved the next item on the agenda—it was quite well done.</p>
<p>I am overrun from morning till night; can't even manage to read a newspaper, and at this very moment there is someone waiting for me downstairs again. To cap it all my brothers<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> are due to come too.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

Early in August, fearful of persecution, Lafargue left for Spain and Laura followed him. Jenny and Eleanor were arrested in Luchon and later expelled from France. On this see K. Marx, 'Letter to the Editor of <i>The Sun,</i> Charles Dana' and Jenny Marx's Letter to the Editor of<i> Woodhull &amp; Claflin's Weekly</i> (present edition, Vol. 22, pp. 396-99, 622).</span>

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Early in August 1871 Lafargue had to flee to Spain in order to escape persecution by the Versailles Government. On 11 August he was arrested in Huesca on the orders of the Thiers government, but released 10 days later.</span>

<li id="cite_note-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-3">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Marx wrote this letter to Theodor Koll, treasurer of the German Workers' Educational Society in London (see Note 135), in connection with the slander campaign which the Lassallean elements in the Society were conducting against him. They alleged that Marx had embezzled money collected by the Society for the striking tailors in Pest. Early in August 1871 Marx temporarily withdrew from the Society. In December 1871 the Lassalleans were expelled.</span>

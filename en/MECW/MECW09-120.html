<br><em>Cologne,</em> May 7. The Prussian gentlemen seem to be making every effort to provoke a riot.
<br>The day before yesterday the artillerymen (concerning whom, incidentally, the Government is labouring under a great illusion) were paid 15 silver groschen per man as a "supplement" for the previous month. True, the infantry also received this supplement.
<br>The officers of one regiment stationed here have <em>directly called on</em> their soldiers to start a riot tomorrow.
<br>This evening a scuffle between soldiers and civilians has already taken place on Neumarkt Square.
<br>Once more we ask the workers <em>whether they want to let the Prussian gentlemen dictate the moment for the uprising</em>?

<p><i>Cologne,</i> May 7. The Prussian gentlemen seem to be making every effort to provoke a riot.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday the artillerymen (concerning whom, incidentally, the Government is labouring under a great illusion) were paid 15 silver groschen per man as a "supplement" for the previous month. True, the infantry also received this supplement.</p>
<p>The officers of one regiment stationed here have <i>directly called on</i> their soldiers to start a riot tomorrow.</p>
<p>This evening a scuffle between soldiers and civilians has already taken place on Neumarkt Square.</p>
<p>Once more we ask the workers <i>whether they want to let the Prussian gentlemen dictate the moment for the uprising</i>?

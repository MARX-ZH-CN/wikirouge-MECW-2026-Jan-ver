ENGELS TO J. GUGENHEIM
<br>IN LONDON
<br>[Draft]
<br>[London,] 16 June 1879
<br>I beg to acknowledge receipt of your esteemed letter of 29 May and regret that under present circumstances I cannot comply with the wish expressed in the same that I deliver a lecture to your Society.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>The organ of that Society, the <i>Freiheit,</i> has thought fit publicly to attack the attitude of Social-Democratic deputies in the Reichstag.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Now even though statements have been made in the Reichstag by certain of our members which I, too, regard as inept (and about which I have not hesitated to express my views privately and in an appropriate place),<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> I can in no way declare myself in agreement with the kind of criticism chosen by the <i>Freiheit</i> and still less with its having felt obliged to pursue <i>this</i> kind of criticism <i>in public.</i>
<br>You will understand that if I were willing to deliver a lecture to the Society under these circumstances, this would inevitably give rise to the view in Germany and elsewhere that I condoned the attitude adopted by the <i>Freiheit.</i>

As follows from Bebel's reply to Bracke of 24 May, Engels criticised Wilhelm Liebknecht's Reichstag speech on the introduction of the state of siege in Berlin (see Note 486) as evidence of the Social-Democrats' submission to the Anti-Socialist Law.</span>

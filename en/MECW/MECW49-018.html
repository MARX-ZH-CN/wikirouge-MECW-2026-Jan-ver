ENGELS TO HERMANN ENGELS</p>
<p>IN ENGELSKIRCHEN</p>
<p>[London,] 22 September 1890</p>
<p>Dear Hermann,</p>
<p>When your letter of 28 May arrived I was just expecting a visit from my Dublin wine merchant and so I decided to wait and discuss the matter with him in person. As it happened, however, the man didn't come until the end of June when I was wholly taken up with my impending departure<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and so forgot about your sherry until re- minded a few days ago by another look at your letter and again today by your second one. Not that you will have suffered as a result, since travelling during the hot weather would have done the wine no good and it will at any rate now travel more safely. I shall write to Dublin at once and see what can be done. Brett will certainly supply you with good wine; I have laid down another 50 or 60 dozen claret and port of the recent good years; I don't use much sherry, but in this re- spect, too, the chap is reliable. So more news very shortly. I have just spent 4 weeks beside the Channel, at Folkestone, and feel extremely well and cheerful. Let's hope it lasts! Love to you and yours,</p>
<p>From your old</p>
<p>Friedrich

ENGELS TO JENNY MARX<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 14 April 1858</p>
<p>Dear Mrs Marx,</p>
<p>I trust that Moor is at last on the road to recovery and will soon be able to return unhampered to his labours on political economy.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I was also plagued with toothache last week. By Sunday it had gone, only to return with added virulence this evening just as I was settling down to sort out some preliminary stuff on the conquest of Lucknow<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> for the <i>Tribune.</i> Whether I shall succeed in these circumstances seems very doubtful. At any rate I shall try and read up the subject this evening and if possible concoct something, even if not much, tomorrow midday while I'm at the office. But it would at any rate be a good idea if Moor were to have a <i>sujet in petto</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> so that, if the worst comes to the worst, there's something to send the fellows.</p>
<p>I still find working in the evenings very tiring and, if I go on for too long or for two evenings running, I get over-excited and suffer from insomnia, particularly when I've had a lot of writing to do during the day. And I also feel very stupid and lethargic in the evenings until I wake myself up by forcing myself to concentrate on some subject. My memory is better on the whole, although every day I still find that things I have done or heard the day before vanish so completely from my mind that they might never have happened, and it's only when I've been reminded of <i>individual details</i> that it all comes back to me. Otherwise I am physically strong and healthy again, able to stand up to strains and stresses and—<i>sauf le</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> <i> TOOTHACHE—to any kind of weather.</i></p>
<p>Lupus is still very lame and is having to spend more on CABS in one week than he usually does in a year. But he is improving visibly and in a week's time he'll probably again be able to stand a certain amount of walking. He sends everyone his best wishes.</p>
<p>How do you like the Bernard trial?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> The French <i>mouchards</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> and their worthy <i>confrère</i> MR Rogers are cutting a pretty figure.</p>
<p>Yesterday's <i>Morning Post</i> drew a very nice picture of the trial's physiognomy. That Chevalier Estien was excellendy portrayed.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>I have today received from DEAR Harney 3 more <i>Independent</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> from which it transpires that his arch-enemy, Seigneur Godfrey, has begun a fresh libel suit against him.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> The man will soon be thinking himself as 'greet' as the 'greet'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> Lassalle.</p>
<p>'OUR FAITHFUL ALLY"<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> is now weighing on English commerce like a nightmare. Nobody wants to speculate or buy more than his immediate requirements because the whole of Philistia is expecting war, revolution or even more oudandish things in France.</p>
<p>Very best wishes to the girls and Moor,</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>F. Engels

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">In the summer of 1857 Marx began to write a series of economic manuscripts  in order to sum up and systematise the results of his extensive economic  research started in the 1840s and continued most intensively in the 1850s.  (In the first half of the 1850s he filled 24 paginated and several unpaginated  notebooks with excerpts from the works of bourgeois economists, books of  statistics, documents and periodicals.) These manuscripts were preliminary  versions of an extensive economic work in which he intended to investigate the  laws governing the development of capitalist production and to criticise  bourgeois political economy. Marx oudined the main points of this treatise in  an unfinished draft of the 'Introduction' (one of the first manuscripts of the  series) and in letters to Engels, Lassalle and Weydemeyer (see pp. 298-304,  269-71, 286-87, 376-78). Further economic study prompted Marx to specify  and change his original plan. The central place in the series is occupied by the  extensive manuscript,<i> Critique of Political Economy</i> (widely known as the  <i>Grundrisse),</i> on which Marx worked from October 1857 to May 1858. In this  preliminary draft of his future<i> Capital</i> Marx expounded his theory of surplus  value. After the first instalment had been prepared for publication in 1859  under the title<i> A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy,</i> Marx added  several more manuscripts to the series in 1861.  The manuscripts of 1857-61 were first published in German by the Institute  of Marxism-Leninism of the CC CPSU in 1939 under the editorial heading  <i>Grundrisse der Kritik der politischen Ökonomie (Rohentwurf).</i> These manuscripts  and<i> A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy. Part One</i> are included in  Vols. 29 and 30 of the present edition.—217, 224, 226, 238, 244, 249, 256, 270,  287, 307, 499, 566.</span>

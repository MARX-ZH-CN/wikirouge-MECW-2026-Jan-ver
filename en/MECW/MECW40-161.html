ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>Manchester, 22 April 1858
<br>Dear Moor,
<br>I wrote to your wife last week and the following day sent an article on Lucknow<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and also <i>Guardians</i> (or cuttings, I don't remember exactly). I hope everything arrived safely. 2 more <i>Guardians</i> go off today. Russell's report in Tuesday's <i>Times</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> did not have the makings of an article, but I'm saving it up until the arrival of the next mail; this is sure to bring the last part of the Lucknow story, when the whole thing can be polished off all at one go—with, I hope, the help of Campbell's despatches as well. Meanwhile I have thrown myself into 'Cavalry' again—shall leave open bits of the historical section for the present until I can unearth the relevant sources, and shall get on with the tactical side. The article will probably take up 10 or 12 of my long double pages, and maybe more.
<br>The <i>affaire</i> Bernard<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> will greatly mortify Monsieur Bonaparte and make quite an impression on the refugee <i>crapauds</i> in London. James' speech, by the way, was feeble and <i>décousu</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> and as usual old Campbell's summing up went against the PRISONER. The old donkey is vexed at losing the chance of an interesting legal case when he could have presided over 15 other judges.
<br>The revelations made by Cavour and La Marmora<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> about their relations with Cavaignac and the latter's fear of Austria<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> will be of interest to the <i>républicains purs.</i> The more that comes to light about the <i>National's</i> period of supremacy, the more pitiful it seems.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

Introduced at the request of Napoleon Ill's government, it envisaged measures against attempts on the life of foreign monarchs. During the debate on 16 and 17 April, Prime Minister Cavour and General La Marmora recalled the summer 1848 events and exposed the policy of the bourgeois republican general Cavaignac, then head of the executive in France, who refused to support revolutionary Italy in her struggle against Austria.—309</span>

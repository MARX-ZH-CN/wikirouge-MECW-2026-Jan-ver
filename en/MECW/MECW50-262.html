ENGELS TO WITOLD JODKO-NARKIEWICZ
<br>IN LONDON
<br>[London,] 2 February 1895<br>
41 Regent's Park Road, N. W.
<br>Dear Comrade, Unfortunately I can give you absolutely no hint as to how the German comrades might view the proposal regarding the addition to the name of the next congress. 506 So far as I myself am concerned, I think that <i>on this occasion</i> one might oblige the Trades Unions, since the congress will be held on English soil where the Trades Unions have, after all, always got the bulk of organised labour behind them, so that a congress in which they played <i>no</i> part would create a bad impression. At the same time it cannot but be of importance to us to encourage the trend that is driving Trades Unions more and more into the socialist camp. Kindest regards.
<br>Yours,
<br>F. Engels
<br>Dr and Mrs Freyberger also send you their kindest regards.

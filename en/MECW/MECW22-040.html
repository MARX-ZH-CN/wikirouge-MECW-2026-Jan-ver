<p>Sir,—</p>
<p>The remarks of The Times on the repeated postponement of the trial of the Communist prisoners at Versailles<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>have undoubtedly hit the nail on the head and have expressed the feeling of the French public. The angry note of the Journal officiel<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>in reply to these remarks is but one of the many proofs of the fact. In consequence of the article in The Times, many reclamations have been addressed to the Paris press, reclamations which, under these circumstances, had no chance of being published. I have before me the letter of a Frenchman whose official position enables him to know the facts he is writing about, and whose testimony as to the motives of this unaccountable delay ought to have some value. Here are some extracts from this letter:</p>
<p>"Nobody as yet knows when the 3rd Court-martial will open its sittings. The cause of this appears to be that Captain Grimai, Commissaire de la République (public accuser), has been superseded by another and more reliable man; it has been found out at the last moment, on perusal of his general report which was to be read in court, that he was perhaps a little bit of a republican, that he had served under Faidherbe etc in the Army of the North etc—Well; all at once another officer presents himself at his office saying: here is my commission, I am your successor; the poor captain was so surprised that he went nearly mad....</p>
<p>"M. Thiers has the pretention to do everything by himself, this mania goes so far that not only has he called together, contrary to all rules of fairness, all the juges d'instruction<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>in his cabinet, but he pretends even to regulate the composition of the public to be admitted into the Court; he himself, through M. B. St. Hilaire, distributes the tickets of admission....</p>
<p>"In the mean time the prisoners at Satory die like flies—pitiless death works faster than the justice of these litde statesmen.... There is in the Versailles Cellular prison a big fellow who does not speak a word of French, he is supposed to be an Irishman. How he got into this trouble is still a mystery.— Amongst the prisoners there is a very honest man called..., he has been in his cell for two months and has not yet been examined. It is infamous."</p>
<p><b>I am, Sir,</b></p>
<p><b>Your obedient servant,</b></p>
<p><i><b>Justitia</b></i>

<p>London, 26 April 1887</p>
<p><br>
My dear Laura,</p>
<p>My congratulations to Paul <i>le candidat du Jardin des Plantes—et des animaux</i>. Being, in his quality as a nigger, a degree nearer to the rest of the animal kingdom than the rest of us, he is undoubtedly the most appropriate representative of that district.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Let us hope the <i>animaux</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> will have the best of it in this struggle against the <i>bêtes</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> I am rather surprised at Baslu's holding back, but if a set of men succeeds in being excluded from the press altogether,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> what can they expect? Fom Mesa's letter in the Spanish <i>Socialista</i> I see that the Blanquists too are making volte-face and approaching the Possibilists<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> —another bad sign. A little success—even relative—at the elections would therefore be very welcome when our people are under such a momentary cloud. I know very well that that cloud will pass, that Parisian party life is a continual change of ups and downs, but at the same time I cannot but wish that next time they will cherish their own little weekly paper a little more than those disreputable dailies to which they work hard to give a reputation in order to be kicked out as soon as they have succeeded.</p>
<p>That Stanton of yours seems to be an out-and-out Yankee. But the cutest Yankee in Europe is as often and as much out of his element as the toughest Polish Jew. They misjudge the people they have to deal with.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> The New York Executive have launched in their despair another circular against Aveling saying that his statements are lies, yet making very important admissions in our favour.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> We shall of course reply. But the affair is practically ended, the Executive are themselves accused in New York as swindlers and liars in another affair and on their trial before the New York sections; so that whatever they have said, say, or may say, loses all importance. In the meantime the <i>Aufsichtsbehörde</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> of the American party appeals to them (to Edward and Tussy) to let the matter drop, and from very many places they receive very nice letters both from Americans and Germans. So that matter is virtually settled. Edward and Tussy's agitation in the East End clubs is going on very favourably. The American example has its effects; it at last offers a handle to stir up the English working people.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the League<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> the Anarchists are on the decline, as everywhere when they are seriously handled instead of being trifled with. Their last proposal yesterday in the Council was, that at the Conference of Delegates<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> all <i>vérification des mandats</i> should be suppressed and anybody accepted who said he was a delegate—to allow them to manufacture their usual bogus votes. This however was too much even for Morris; yet a minority of five was found to vote for such nonsense!</p>
<p>The Pagny affair<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> is not quite clear to me yet. The gist of the matter lies in Art. 4, No. 1, of the German Penal Code:</p>
<p><i>'Pourra être poursuivi selon les lois pénales de l'empire allemand:</i></p>
<p><i>1) un étranger qui aura commis, à l'étranger {en pays étranger) un acte de haute trahison contre l'empire allemand ou contre un des états fédérés, ou qui aura fait de la fausse monnaie.'</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>To apply this article to anybody but a political refugee not naturalised abroad, must produce a collision with the country of the man prosecuted. No nation in its senses will stand such treatment and if they tried it upon an Englishman, the most peaceable minister would be compelled to send at once the British fleet to the German coast. Therefore this looks as if Bismarck wanted to place France between war or humiliation. For that he was ignorant of the warrant against Schnaebelé is impossible. And yet the state of Europe is such that a war would be, for Bismarck, to play va banque. The man must be completely mad to act thus.</p>
<p>Perhaps a few days more will give a clue. I really cannot imagine him to be such a consummate ass.</p>
<p>Enclosed the cheque Paul writes for £12.</p>
<p>Nim is well—was at the theatre last night with Pumps—going again this week to the Princess's—with Edward's ticket. Beer is flowing plentiful—I consume fully 2 bottles a day and march three miles, and for the last few Sundays have taken a glass of Port—<i>voila, du progrès!</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Bien à vous, je vous embrasse</i>

Its leaders - Paul Brousse and Benoit Malon -caused a split in the French Workers' Party (see note 33) in 1882 and formed the Federation of Socialist Workers. Its ideological basis was the theory of municipal socialism. The Possibilists pursued a 'policy of the possible' ('la politique des possibilités'). At the beginning of the 20th century the Possibilists merged with the French Socialist Party.</span>

<li id="cite_note-10"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-10">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The Socialist League was founded in December 1884 by a group of English socialists who had withdrawn from the Social Democratic Federation (see note 62). The League's organisers included Eleanor Marx Aveling, Ernest Belfort Bax and William Morris. 'The Manifesto of the Socialist League' (see The Commonweal No.l, February 1885) stated that its members advocated 'the principles of Revolutionary International Socialism' and sought 'a change in the basis of Society ... which would destroy the distinctions of classes and nationalities'. The tasks of the League included the formation of a national socialist party, the conquest of political power through the election of socialists to local government bodies, and the promotion of the trade union and co-operative movement. In the League's early years its leaders took an active part in the working-class movement. However, in 1887 the League split into three factions (Anarchist elements, 'parliamentarists and 'anti-parliamentarists'). With sectarian tendencies growing stronger, the League gradually distanced itself from the day-to-day struggle of the British workers and finally disintegrated in 1889-90.</span>

<li id="cite_note-12"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-12">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">This refers to the 'Schnaebelé case', a conflict between France and Germany engineered by the Bismarck government. On 20 April 1887 Police Commissioner Schnaebelé, a French border official in Pagny-sur-Moselle, was invited onto German territory, ostensibly for negotiations, and arrested on charges of organising espionage and encouraging young people in Alsace-Lorraine to emigrate from Germany. At the same time, the German ruling quarters launched a virulent anti-French press campaign. This was taken advantage of by French revanchist circles for stepping up anti-German propaganda. However, the governments of Russia, Great Britain and Austria-Hungary refused to support Bismarck. Germany was forced to beat a retreat. On 30 April Schnaebelé was released and the conflict thus settled.</span>

<p><i>Cologne,</i> June 11<i>. Both assemblies, the one in Frankfurt and the one in Berlin, have solemnly put on record their admission of incompetence. One assembly, by its vote on the question of Schleswig-Holstein, recognises the Federal Diet as its superior authority.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <i>The other, by its decision to reject Deputy Berends' motion and by passing to the substantiated order of the day, not only repudiates the revolution, a but expressly admits that it is solely empowered to agree upon the Constitution</i> and thereby recognises the basic principle underlying the draft of the Constitution that has been proposed by the Camphausen Government. Both assemblies have given a correct appraisal of their worth. They are both <i>incompetent</i>.

The Assembly thus avoided taking any responsibility for the final settlement of the Schleswig-Holstein question and allowed the Federal Diet complete freedom of action on this issue</span>

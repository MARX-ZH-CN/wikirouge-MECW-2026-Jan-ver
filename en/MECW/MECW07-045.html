<p><em>Cologne,</em> June 25. We have the misfortune to be good prophets. What we foretold in No. 19 has come to pass. Herr Reichensperger from Trier really has become President of the provincial court of justice. That is a consolation in these hard times. Guizot-Camphausen may have been overthrown, Duchâtel-Hansemann may be tottering — but the Guizot-Duchâtel system of corruption seems to be intent on striking new roots here. And what do the individuals matter, as long as the thing itself is at hand? — Incidentally, we would recommend Herr Reichensperger to read the address from Berncastel<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> in our special supplement published this morning.

ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>London, 11 April 1883</p>
<p>My dear Laura,</p>
<p>I do indeed think, along with you, that Paul ought to go and see his mother and I have told him so many a time and many a year ago. As to the extra expense, that will not be much and I can soon find you that, if informed in time. Only, if things are as you describe, it will re- quire some considerable diplomacy on Paul's part, not to spoil his own game — that Christian sister of charity ought not to be made an enemy of 7—she is <i>always</i> there and Paul <i>not,</i> and if only her sus- picions are aroused, be sure she will never cease to beguile the old woman i«to a will as much in her favour as the law will permit. So that point I suppose is settled — you'll have to look after the execu- tion.</p>
<p>We all of us have had a hearty laugh at your account of the Argen- teuil adventures. 8 It is so like him<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> from beginning to end. To-day it is a week that Tussy sent him a very categorical letter: when is the boy<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> to come? Not a line in reply. // <i>est toujours en train de réfléchir.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Paul is sure of six months at least.<sup>9</sup> He was awfully funky about it when here, and amused Liebknecht out of all measure with his <i>horror carceris.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> But if he does not now start in earnest to learn German, I shall consider him to be nothing but <i>un enfant gâté.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> Imagine he writes to me that he <i>will</i> learn it—<b>comme vous le dites très bien<i> (!) </i>il pourra<i> (!) </i>devenir nécessaire que je le sache pour des traductions!</b><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> As if the perfection of his own accomplishments, bright as they are, did not en- tirely depend on his reading certain German things, published and unpublished! He rejoices in the prospect of the 2nd volume [of] <i>Capi- tal</i> being published, but will he ever be able to read it?</p>
<p>If M-me Gendre will translate the <i>Manifest</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> into French and let me revise the translation (it's no child's play, you know) I will write her a preface sufficient to explain the historical circumstances, etc. ' ° But as I know nothing much of the lady, I am bound to say at present: no revision, no preface. A <i>right</i> to stop any proceedings of hers in that di- rection I have not. This notabene is for Paul. So is this: What speech of Giffen he writes about I don't know, nor where it was published.</p>
<p>Pumps is still 'expectant', or was so at least last night. Percy's mother told him the other day that really he ought to be a little better informed in a case like that.</p>
<p>Jollymeyer is here for a few days. Since then (as some days before he left 10 days ago) we have every evening a bobby promenading be- fore the house, when I let Carlo out about 12. The imbeciles evidently think we are manufacturing dynamite, when in reality we are discuss- ing whisky.</p>
<p>Kind regards from him and myself to both of you.</p>
<p>Yours affectionately,</p>
<p>F. Engels

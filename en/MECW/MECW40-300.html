MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>London, 7 November 1859</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>I shall send you the Grimm.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>I have not written anything yet about Morocco,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> or about the Caucasus,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> or any military stuff on Asia. I have no diplomatic particulars about Morocco, so you will have to pick up your pen again. My circumstances are such as to preclude my doing sufficient work on the 2nd instalment, which I regard as of crucial importance.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> It does, in fact, contain the pith of all the bourgeois stuff.</p>
<p>Biskamp's letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> is infinitely discreditable; in view of his situation one can explain but not excuse it. The whole of vulgar democracy is seeking to hush up the Blind affair in the German press while assailing me. E.g. Mr Meyen, present editor of the <i>Freischütz.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> I have now sent a sharply-worded statement to the Augsburg <i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i> and the <i>Reform</i> in Hamburg.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> I shall bring Vogt and Blind face to face even if it has to be done at gun point.</p>
<p>In a couple of lines in the <i>Tribune</i> the wretched Pulszky dismisses my letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> as emanating from the camp of the 'CRACKED' Urquhart.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> The fellows dare not open their traps. For they don't know what kind of evidence we have at our disposal. For Kossuth, or so Szemere wrote and told me, secretly decamped after the treaty of Villafranca without a word to Klapka and the other officers. For he was afraid of being handed over to the Austrians.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> Hence the greatest animosities against him in the Hungarian camp. I shall give Pulszky a thorough lambasting.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

In October 1859 Spain declared war on Morocco and invaded the country. This colonial incursion met with stubborn resistance and brought the Spaniards no success. The fighting continued until March 1860. In April a peace treaty was concluded under which Spain received indemnities and insignificant territorial concessions.—515, 523</span>

<li id="cite_note-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-3">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Marx refers to the war waged by the mountaineers of Daghestan and Chechnya under Shamil against Tsarist Russia. Having defeated Shamil's main forces and taken him prisoner (August 1859), the Russians were breaking the resistance of separate detachments of Shamil's followers.—523</span>

<li id="cite_note-4"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-4">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">After the publication, in June 1859, of the first instalment of<i> A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</i> (see present edition, Vol. 30), Marx intended, as previously agreed with the Berlin publisher Duncker, to prepare for the press and publish as the second instalment the 'Chapter on Capital', which constitutes the bulk of his main economic manuscript of 1857-58; and then publish the remaining parts of his economic work (see Notes 250 and 355). As he proceeded with his plan, however, he realised that he would have to do more research to formulate the basic propositions of his economic theory. But his journalistic activity and other party obligations, above all the need to refute publicly Vogt's slanderous allegations against proletarian revolutionaries, temporarily diverted him from his economic studies. It was not until 1861 that he resumed them in earnest. Later Marx decided to publish his researches not as the second and further instalments of<i> A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</i> but as a large independent work.—489, 498, 502, 508, 511, 522, 523, 542, 574</span>

ENGELS TO PYOTR LAVROV</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>London, 12 February 1885</p>
<p>My dear Lavrov,</p>
<p>I hasten to reply to your questions.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>The item about the <i>Neue Rheinische Leitung. Revue,</i> edited by Karl Marx, Hamburg and London, 1850, is absolutely correct. It appeared in <i>Heft</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>I-VI and was pub- lished by Schuberth in Hamburg. You yourself asked me a few months ago for information about the articles by Marx which ap- peared in the <i>Revue</i> on the subject of the February revolution and the events that followed it. ' 5 6 I possess only 3 of the instalments and have tried in vain to get hold of the complete set. The other facts provided by Groß are also correct, if memory serves me aright (Tussy has got my copy, so I can't compare it). Needless to say, I in no way agree with his silly strictures on Marx's theories. He was recommended to me by the Viennese socialists and, in reply to some biographical ques- tions he put to me, I gave him the facts.</p>
<p>The German translation of the <i>Poverty</i> contains just a few explana- tory notes by me,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>but also an article written by Marx in 1865 on Proudhon and his speech of 1847 on free trade.</p>
<p>The 2nd volume of <i>Capital</i> is now being printed; yesterday I cor- rected the 4th sheet. The rest of the manuscript goes off from here in a fortnight's time. The 3rd volume will be the most important one, and I shall get to work on it as soon as the 2nd has been well and truly launched.— The English edition is dragging its feet, the two translators<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>being too busy with other matters to work at it with the proper ardour. It will be finished, I hope, come the sum- mer.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>I had already heard that you were having trouble with your eyes. Would it not be wise to give up working for a time so as not to tire your eyesight unduly? I find that, at our age, it is always best to tackle morbid symptoms when they first occur. Let's hope that you will be able to let me have better news before too long.</p>
<p>In the preface to the 2nd volume of <i>Capital,</i> I again revert to Rodbertus in order to show that the objections he raises against Marx result from his quite unbelievable ignorance of classical political economy.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>F. Engels</p>

Answer to the 'Philosophy of Poverty' by M. Proudhon</i> which was written in French and appeared in Brussels and Paris in 1847. The translation into German was begun by Eduard Bernstein who was later joined by Karl Kautsky. Engels edited the trans lation, wrote a special preface for it and a number of notes, using the amendments made by Marx on a copy of the French edition of 1847. The book was published by Dietz in Stuttgart in January 1885.</span>

<li id="cite_note-5"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-5">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The idea of translating<i> Capital</i> into English occurred to Marx as early as 1865, when he was working on the manuscript (see Marx's letter to Engels of 31 July 1865, present edition, Vol. 42). The British journalist and member of the Interna tional's General Council, Peter Fox, was to help Marx find a publisher. However, this matter was not settled due to Fox's death in 1869. The English translation of the first volume of<i> Capital,</i> edited by Engels, did not appear until after Marx's death, in January 1887, and was published by Swan Sonnenschein, Lowrey &amp; Co., London. The translation was done by Samuel Moore and Edward Aveling between mid-1883 and March 1886. Eleanor Marx-Aveling took part in the preparatory work for the edition (see also this volume, pp. 33 and 127-28).</span>

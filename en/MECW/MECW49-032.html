ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT
<br>IN BERLIN
<br>L[ondon,] 25 October 1890
<br>I am sending you, addressed to your office, today's <i>Justice</i> containing an article by A. S. Headingley (alias Adolphe Smith), in which the lot of you, and yourself in particular, are branded Possibilists.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>The writer is an Englishman born in Paris, <i>literatus vulgarissimus,</i> who was in Paris at the time of the Commune and afterwards came to this country with a MOVING PANORAMA of Paris and the Commune; as a speculation this was a total flop, something for which he never forgave us, for he had believed that the General Council of the International would drum up a nightly audience for him. He therefore became an intimate of the <i>branche française</i><sup>10</sup> in which all the <i>mouchards</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and scoundrels — Vésinier, Caria, etc.,— foregathered to hatch plots and, with the help of French <i>fonds secrets,</i> published newspapers in which to attack the General Council — <i>des calomnies ordurières</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> . For the past eight years or so he has been Brousse's principal agent here and the intermediary between him, the SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC Federation here,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> and sundry Belgians (he is resident interpreter at the Possibilists' and miners' international congresses). The evil intent will be obvious to you, as will the stupidity — these chaps have utterly failed to understand the Halle resolution and believe that the Possibilists, who are killing themselves off in France, can be salvaged in Germany. POOR FELLOWS!
<br>Your
<br>F.E.

For a long time the leadership of the Federation was in the hands of reformists led by Hyndman, an opportunist sectarian. In opposition to them, the revolutionary Marxists within the Federation (Eleanor Marx-Aveling, Edward Aveling, Tom Mann and others) worked for close ties with the revolutionary labour movement. In the autumn of 1884 — following a split and the establishment by the Left wing of an independent organisation, the Socialist League (see Note 49) — the opportunists' influence in the Federation increased. However, revolutionary elements, discontented with the opportunist leadership, continued to form within the Federation, under the impact of the masses.</span>

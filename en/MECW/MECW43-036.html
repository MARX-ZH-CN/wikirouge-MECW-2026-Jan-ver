MARX TO ENGELS
<br>IN MANCHESTER
<br>London, 29 JUNE 1868
<br>DEAR FRED,
<br>BEST COMPLIMENTS FROM Tussy and Jennychen. The doctor is very satisfied although POOR Jenny is suffering from SLEEPLESSNESS and also from coughing. He said today: as soon as the children are over their illness, they should leave London immediately and be sent to the seaside. (Perhaps they could go together with Lizzie?)
<br>Enclosed copies of <i>Elberfelder Zeitung</i> which reached me today from Germany. <i>Dr. Fr. Schnacke</i> is named on the ENVELOPE as the author<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and sender; I remember his name from 1848, but do not know him personally. THERE IS MUCH MUDDLING IN HIS ARTICLES.
<br>There is time enough if you send me the ARTICLE by the end of this week.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>I am very TIRED as the anxiety of the recent period completely prevented me from sleeping.
<br><i>Salut.</i>
<br>Your
<br>K. M.
<br>Today a letter from Kugelmann. 4 pages about the treatment of SCARLATINA.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Dietzgen from Petersburg visited him at Whitsun on his way to the Rhine.

While working on the review, Engels wrote out excerpts from <i>Capital,</i> which later made up a synopsis (see Note 26). The review was written around 20 May-1 June 1868, but rejected by the editorial board (see present edition, Vol. 20).</span>

MARX TO JENNY LONGUET<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN ARGENTEUIL</p>
<p>London, 17 December 1881</p>
<p>41 Maitland Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>My Dear Child,</p>
<p>Tussy, SUPPORTED BY Engels, is this moment taking the Christmas hamper for our little ones by CAB to the PARCEL COMPANY. <i>Helen</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>wants me to point out specially that 1 little jacket for Harry,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>1 for Eddy,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>and a woollen bonnet for Pa<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup><i>are from her;</i> again for the selfsame Pa, a 'little blue frock' from <i>Laura;</i> from myself a SAILOR s SUIT for MY DEAR Johnny. On one of the last days of her life, Möhmchen<sup>d</sup> laughed so merrily when telling Laura how you and I took Johnny to Paris, and chose a suit for him there in which he looked like a little <i>bourgeois gentilhomme</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The letters of condolence I get from near and far, and from people of such various nationalities, professions, etc., etc., are, in their appre- ciation of Möhmchen, all of them animated by a spirit of truth and a depth of feeling rarely found in what are as a rule merely conven- tional tributes. I ascribe this to the fact that everything about her was natural and genuine, unforced and without affectation. Hence the impression she made on others was one of vivaciousness and lucidity; even Mrs Hess writes:</p>
<p>'In her, Nature has destroyed its own masterpiece, for never in my life have I met so witty and loving a woman.'</p>
<p>Liebknecht writes to say that, without her, he would have suc- cumbed to the wretchedness of exile, etc., etc.</p>
<p>How exceptionally healthy she was by nature, for all her delicate constitution, is evident from the fact that, despite being bed-ridden for so long, she did not have a sore spot on her body, much to the as- tonishment of the doctors; during my recent illness I already had a number of sore places after only two weeks of being confined to bed.</p>
<p>The weather has been very bad since I got over my illness, so I have been under house arrest up till now, but next week, on doctors' orders, I am to go to Ventnor (Isle of Wight) and from there, later on, somewhere further south. Tussy will accompany me.</p>
<p>You will be getting (posted at the same time as this) an article about me in the monthly review <i>Modern Thought.</i> It's the first time an English critic has gone into the matter with such enthusiasm. It ar- rived in time to cheer Möhmchen up. Where the QUOTATIONS from the German 'text' are too bad (I MEAN too badly DONE INTO ENGLISH), I have got Tussy to write in corrections on such few copies as we are reserv- ing for friends. The mistakes that occur under the heading 'LIFE' are indifferent.</p>
<p>And now, my dear child, the best service you can do me is to keep your chin up! I hope that I shall spend many more happy days with you and worthily fulfil my functions as a GRANDPA.</p>
<p>With a thousand kisses to you and the little ones,</p>
<p>Your loving</p>
<p>OLD NICK</p>
<p>I could have written much more about Vivanti, etc., but believe that Tussy has bagged this for herself.

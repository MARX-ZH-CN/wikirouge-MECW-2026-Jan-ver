MARX TO IDA PAULI</p>
<p>IN RHEINAU</p>
<p>[Karlsbad,] 10 September 1876</p>
<p>My dear Mrs Pauli,</p>
<p>My warmest thanks for your kind invitation. I'm sorry to say that an unfortunate contingency has arisen which precludes my taking advantage of it.</p>
<p>Today, you see, our four weeks' cure came to an end.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> As a result of the constant changes of weather, however, my daughter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> went down with a cold, fever, etc. For the time being she is confined to her room and I shall of necessity have to prolong our stay here. As I must be in London on an appointed day because of certain business matters, I shall be able to make even fewer diversions on the return journey. But to postpone is not to abandon. Perhaps we shall meet again next year.</p>
<p>With kindest regards from my daughter to you and Mr Pauli.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

Having completed it, he spent a few days with Max Oppenheim in Prague, and then, after brief visits to Kreuznach and Liège, returned to London on 22 September 1876.</span>

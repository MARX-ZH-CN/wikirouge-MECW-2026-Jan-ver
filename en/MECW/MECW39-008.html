MARX TO JOSEPH WEYDEMEYER</p>
<p>IN NEW YORK</p>
<p>[London,] 23 January 1852 28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Weydemeyer,</p>
<p>Unfortunately my indisposition has up till now prevented me from writing to you this week, i.e. for your paper.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup><i>With</i> <i>much</i> <i>effort</i> I concocted an article for Dana,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>who had received nothing from me for six weeks or more. For years, nothing has so pulled me down as this damned haemorrhoidal complaint, not even the last French fiasco.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup><i>Enfin</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>I shall be all the better for having been forcibly kept away from the library<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>for 4 weeks, hard though this was.</p>
<p>You will be getting two more articles about the 18th Brumaire,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>of which the first will be dispatched, come what may, on Friday next and the other immediately afterwards, if not at the same time.</p>
<p>Enclosed Pieper's article.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>As for Lupus, I have been chivvying him a great deal and he seems to have made up his mind to take a retrospective look at Kossuth's Hungarian <i>carrière</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>for your paper. You have made two mistakes, first in failing to name Lupus along with ourselves in your announcement,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>and secondly in <i>not</i> <i>approaching</i> him <i>direct</i>. Make good the <i>second</i> with a letter which you may enclose in one to myself and in which you urge him to write. No one else among us all has his popular style. He is <i>extrêmement modeste</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>All the more must one avoid giving the impression that his cooperation is regarded as superfluous.</p>
<p>Because I live some distance from Freiligrath and because I received Pieper's article only just before the post left, we have today been compelled to send you <i>two</i> letters instead of <i>one</i>. This will be avoided next time.</p>
<p>Enclosed another statement from my friend <i>Pfänder</i> (Bauer no longer belongs to our League). You will have to publish it, since the Windmill Streeters' statement against him appeared in both the <i>American</i> and the European papers.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup>It would be a good idea if, beneath this statement, you were to print the comment that it contains <i>only</i> what could be published under <i>present</i> <i>police</i> <i>conditions</i> (the accounts between Bauer and Pfänder on the one hand and the former League on the other, further, the control exercised by the <i>Central</i> <i>Authority</i> over the administration of those monies, we being in the majority on the C.A.—none of these things can, of course, be published <i>yet</i>); that, counting on the political precautions we, for our part, have to take in Germany, Arnold Winkelried Ruge,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup>that old gossip and 'Confusius'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup>of European democracy, made an allusion to those matters (i.e. those of Pfänder and Bauer) about which he himself knew only from hearsay at 3rd or 4th hand, in the hope of incriminating <i>myself</i> and <i>Engels</i> in the eyes of the public, although the business was no concern of ours,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup>in just the same way as the jackass suggested that it was the Windmill Streeters who threw <i>us</i> out when it was <i>we</i> who had broken with that society,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup>as Pfänder's letter also implies.</p>
<p>You might also announce that a <i>new</i> <i>workers<b> </b></i><b>society<i> has been formed in London under </i>Stechan</b>s<i> chairmanship,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup>which will keep aloof from 'Emigration', 'Agitation'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup>and Great Windmill Street alike, and pursue a serious line.</i></p>
<p><i>Tu</i> <i>comprends</i>, <i>mon</i> <i>cher</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" id="cite_ref-18">[18]</a></sup>that this society belongs to us, although we only send our younger people there; I refer to our <i>jebildeten</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" id="cite_ref-19">[19]</a></sup>people, not to our workers. They all go there.</p>
<p><i>Stechan</i> has about him something of the solidity of a guild brother and the fickleness of a small master-artisan, but he is educatable and has considerable influence in Northern Germany. That is why I have also called on him to provide contributions for you.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" id="cite_ref-20">[20]</a></sup>We have BY AND BY pushed him into the foreground, which he likes to shun, and into contradiction, which he likes to gloss over. Willich had asked him to guarantee Kinkel's loan<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" id="cite_ref-21">[21]</a></sup>but he refused. At first enthusiastically welcomed by Schapper and Willich, and set against us by them, he was soon enabled by his better nature to see through the shabbiness and hollowness of these fellows and their following. And so (with a little help from Lochner and other assistants with whom we had provided him incognito) he openly broke with the rabble.</p>
<p>Is A. Hentze our Hentze from Hamm? If so, I would write to him, for as it is Willich has done everything to blacken me in his eyes. <i>L'infâme</i>!<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" id="cite_ref-22">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Warmest regards from my family to yours.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. Marx</p>
<p>I am sending material for pamphlets, etc., all in <i>one</i> <i>batch</i>, likewise Jones' <i>Notes</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23" id="cite_ref-23">[23]</a></sup>Sent piecemeal, they cost too much. <i>The</i> <i>Northern</i> <i>Star</i> is no longer in O'Connor's hands but in those of a Chartist faction which is secretly in touch with the Financial and Parliamentary Reformers.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24" id="cite_ref-24">[24]</a></sup></p>

They were accused of stealing this money. A libel campaign against Bauer and Pfänder was started in the press (Schweizerische National-Zeitung, 7 January 1851; Republik der Arbeiter, New York, Nos. 19, 20 and 21 for 23 and 30 August and 6 September 1851). In the statement made on 21 January 1852 and mentioned here, Pfänder refuted the libel and said that on 20 November 1850 the court had acknowledged the charge to be invalid (see present edition, Vol. 38, Note 328). The German Workers' Educational Society in London was founded in February 1840 by Karl Schapper, Joseph Moll and other members of the League of the Just. After the reorganisation of the League of the Just in the summer of 1847 and the founding of the Communist League, the latter's local communities played the leading role in the Society. In 1847 and 1849-50 Marx and Engels took an active part in the Society's work</span>

It consisted of those who had withdrawn from the German Workers' Educational Society (see Note 24) and had the carpenter G. L. Stechan, a refugee from Hanover, as its chairman. An active part in organising this society was also played by Georg Lochner, a worker, Communist League member and close friend of Marx and Engels. The society did not survive long, many of its members, Stechan included, coming under the influence of the Willich-Schapper faction and rejoining their organisation</span>

The aim of both these small organisations was to raise money for an 'immediate revolution' in Germany</span>

Kinkel's trip to the USA for this purpose in September 1851-March 1852 was a failure. In a number of their works (e. g. The Great Men of the Exile, The Knight of the Noble Consciousness, present edition, Vols. 11 and 12), Marx and Engels ridiculed this idea of Kinkel's and denounced the attempts to produce a revolution artificially when the revolutionary movement was on the wane</span>

MacGowan. In 1849 a radical political trend among the Free Traders founded the National Parliamentary and Financial Reform Association to campaign for an electoral reform (the so-called Little Charter) and a taxation reform. By opposing their programme to that of the Chartists and at the same time borrowing some of their demands though in an extremely curtailed form, the bourgeois radicals expected to split the Chartist movement and to influence the workers. The bourgeois radicals, supported in their campaign by Cobden, Bright and the reformist elements among the Chartists under O'Connor, failed and the Association ceased to exist in 1855. In writing about a Chartist faction connected with the supporters of the financial and parliamentary reform, Marx has Harney's group in mind (see Note 20)</span>

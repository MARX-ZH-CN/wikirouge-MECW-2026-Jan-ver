<br>Dear Fred,
<br>With THANKS I notify the £90, first half-notes. Enclosed for Tussy 2 LETTERS. She must reply to tight-fisted Collet.
<br>The enclosed letter from Eichhoff shows, unfortunately, that his brother has become skittish.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Write me what should happen now. The last proof-sheets finally arrived and have been returned, ditto preface sent.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> It now turns out that the procrastination was for two reasons: 1. Mr Wigand in Leipzig is the printer, and 2. Mr Meissner, for his part, does not keep a watch on the Leipziger. He really believed that I had received the last sheets direct from Leipzig several weeks ago. German sloppiness!
<br>The honourable Wilhelm is maintaining a deep silence.
<br>Today the weather finally TURNS to the better.
<br>I have received an invitation from the SOCIETY OF ARTS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> for a <i>conversazione</i> in Kensington Museum on 1 July. This takes place only once a year, and is attended by the entire London aristocracy, from the court down to, etc. So Jennychen will have a chance to see this rabble.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> <br><i>Addio</i>.
<br>Your
<br>K. M.
<br><br>
While re-arranging my bookshelves a small old edition of Rochefoucauld's <i>Réflexions</i> etc. fell into my hands again. Leafing through it, I found:

<blockquote>
<br>'La gravité est un mystère du corps, inventé pour cacher les défauts de l'esprit'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> [56].

</blockquote>
<br>Thus, pinched by Sterne from Rochefoucauld<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> !
<br>And these are nice too:

<blockquote>
<br>'Nous avons tous assez de force pour supporter les maux d'autrui' [5].
<br>'Les vieillards aiment à donner de bons préceptes, pour se consoler de n'être plus en état de donner de mauvais exemples' [20].
<br>'Les rois font des hommes comme des pièces de monnaye; ils les font valoir ce qu'ils veulent; et l'on est forcé de les recevoir selon leur cours, et non pas selon leur véritable prix' [126].
<br>'Quand les vices nous quittent, nous nous flattons de la créance que c'est nous qui les quittons' [39].
<br>'La modération est la langueur et la paresse de l'âme, comme l'ambition en est l'activité et l'ardeur' [63].
<br>'Nous pardonnons souvent à ceux qui nous ennuyent, mais nous ne pouvons pardonner à ceux que nous ennuyons' [65].
<br>'Ce qui fait que les amants et les maîtresses ne s'ennuyent point d'êtres ensemble, c'est qu'ils parlent toujours d'eux-mêmes'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> [67].

</blockquote>
<br>I attended the TRADES UNIONS MEETING LAST WEDNESDAY,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> in Exeter Hall.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> Beesly delivered a really fine, very impudent SPEECH, recalling the June days (it was 24 JUNE).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> The newspapers naturally KILLED, i.e., SUPPRESSED, him. In addition, he committed the crime of speaking very contemptuously of English journalists.

<li id="cite_note-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-3">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">In May 1869, Peter Le Néve Foster, Secretary of the Society of Arts and Trades Board of Directors, sent out letters to a number of persons, including Marx, requesting their consent to be elected to the Society. Marx's letter of 28 May 1869 was a reply to this proposal. On 30 June 1869, the Society's general meeting considered 132 candidatures and took a vote, as a result of which Marx was elected a member. To be admitted, a person had to have three members, at least one being his personal acquaintance, to back his candidature. For Marx, this was Peter Lund Simmonds, a Dane residing in England, a well-known political writer and author of numerous works on botany and agriculture.<br>Marx's admittance to the Society of Arts and Trades signified recognition by British scientific quarters of his merits as a scholar and political writer. The Society of Arts and Trades, which was founded in 1754, set itself the philanthropic and educational goal of 'promoting the arts, trades and commerce'. Its social composition was varied: its managing bodies included both members of the aristocracy, patrons of the Society, and representatives of a broad cross-section of bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals; among the members were also representatives of trade unions. In the 1860s, the Society's membership was in excess of 4,000.<br>In 1853-54, as the mass strike movement began to grow, the Society tried to act as an intermediary between the workers and the manufacturers seeking to take the edge off the class struggle. Marx sharply criticised this position and even called the organisation the ' "Society of Arts" and tricks' (see <a 6.="" allied="" books.="" brigade.="" concerning="" convocation="" count="" debates="" february="" fleet.="" href="MECW12-080.html" irish="" labor="" lue="" mission.="" of="" on="" operations="" orlov's="" parliament"="" parliamentary="" the="">Blue Books. Parliamentary Debates on February 6. Count Orlov's Mission. Operations of the Allied Fleet. The Irish Brigade. Concerning the Convocation of the Labor Parliament</a>).<br>Marx's admission to the Society gave him greater access to scientific literature to be found in the Society's library, including its extremely large collection of works by the 17th-19th century economists. Many of them he used when working on Capital. He was particularly interested in recent research in the field of economics and natural sciences, specifically, chemistry and agriculture, whose results were published in the Society's journal. Marx used the materials of the journal for 1859, 1860, 1866 and 1872 in <a apital,="" href="MECW28-001.html" i"="" volume="">Volume One of Capital</a> (the first and second editions).</br></br></br></span>

Fancy crowd of some 7,000 mutes in full evening dress, wedged in so closely as to be unable either to move about or to sit down, for the chairs, and they were few and far between, a few imperturbable dowagers had taken by storm and stuck to throughout the evening.

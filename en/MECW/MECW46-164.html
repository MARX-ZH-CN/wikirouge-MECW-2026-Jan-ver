ENGELS TO PYOTR LAVROV
<br>IN PARIS
<br>[Postcard]
<br>[London,] 31 July 1882
<br>My dear Lavrov,
<br>I should have thanked you long since for sending me the Russian <i>Manifesto</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> but I couldn't very well write to you without giving you news of Marx and he had expressly forbidden me to tell anyone in Paris, no matter whom, that he was in Argenteuil. Unfortunately the prohibition of the doctors, who have given him strict instructions to talk as little as possible, means he is still in <i>solitary confinement.</i>
<br>Kovalevsky called while I was out. He only saw Miss Marx<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and left no address. He must have departed a few days after his arrival, but I have absolutely no idea what route he took. It would seem that he intended to return to his own country. Miss Marx is at Argenteuil; if you wrote to Longuet, perhaps you might be able to learn more.
<br>Yours ever,
<br>F. E.
<br>[On the side reserved for the address]
<br>Monsieur P. Lavroff 328 rue St Jacques <i>Paris</i> France

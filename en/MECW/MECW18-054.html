<blockquote>
<p>Marx informed Engels of his intention to write an essay on Brune in his letter of September 17, 1857. But he apparently did not begin working on it before the end of November. There is no entry in Marx's notebook about its dispatch to New York. One can only assume that the word "etc." in the entry of January 8, 1858 about the dispatch to Dana of Marx's "Bolivar" and Engels' "Campaign", "Cannonade" and "Captain" refers to this essay. On February 1, 1858, in a letter to Engels, Marx mentioned it among the articles beginning with B already written and sent off to the United States.</p>
<p>Marx's excerpts on the subject from Fr. Chr. Schlosser's book Zur Beurtheilung Napoleon's und seiner neusten Tadler und Lobredner, Frankfurt am Main, 1835 (probably made long before Marx started writing the essay), and a rough draft (more detailed than the final version) of the essay based mainly on Schlosser's book and on relevant articles in the Biographie universelle (Michaud) ancienne et moderne (Vol. 6, Paris, 1854) and The English Cyclopaedia (Vol. V, London, 1856) are extant (see this volume, pp. 397-401).

<p>Brune, Guillaume Marie Anne, a marshal of the French empire, born at Brives-la-Gaillarde, March 13, 1763, died« in Avignon, Aug. 2, 1815. His father sent him to Paris to study the law, but on leaving the university, financial difficulties caused him to become a printer. In the beginning of the revolution, together with Gauthier and Jourgniac de St. Méard, he published the Journal general de la Cour et de la Ville. He soon embraced the party of the revolution, enlisted in the national guard, and became an ardent member of the club of the cordeliers.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> His grand figure, martial air, and boisterous patriotism, rendered him one of the military leaders of the people in the demonstration of 1791 in the Champ de Mars, which was crushed by La Fayette's national guards.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Thrown into prison, and the rumor spreading that the partisans of the court had attempted to get rid of him by odious means, Danton was instrumental in procuring his release. To the protection of the latter, among whose partisans he became prominent, he owed a military appointment during the famous days of Sept. 1792,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> and his sudden promotion, in Oct. 12, 1792, to the rank of colonel and adjutant-major. He served under Dumouriez in Belgium; was sent against the federalists of Calvados, advancing under Gen. Puisaye upon Paris, whom he easily defeated. He was next made a general of brigade, and participated in the battle of Hondschoote.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> The committee of public safety intrusted him with the mission of putting down the insurrectionary movements in the Gironde, which he did with the utmost rigor.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>After Danton's imprisonment, he was expected to rush to the rescue of his friend and protector, but keeping prudently aloof during the first moments of danger, he contrived to shift through the reign of terror. After the 9th Thermidor he again joined the now victorious Dantonists,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> and followed Fréron to Marseilles and Avignon. On the 13th Vendémiaire (Oct. 5, 1795) he acted as one of Bonaparte's under-generals against the revolted sections of Paris.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> After having assisted the directory in putting down the conspiracy of the camp at Grenelle (Sept. 9, 1796),<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> he entered the Italian army in the division of Masséna, and distinguished himself during the whole campaign by great intrepidity. Wishing to propitiate the chiefs of the cordeliers, Bonaparte attributed part of his success at Rivoli<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> to the exertions of Brune, appointed him general of division on the battle-field, and induced the directory to instal him as commander of the second division of the Italian army, made vacant by Augereau's departure for Paris.</p>
<p>After the peace of Campo Formio<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> he was employed by the directory on the mission of first lulling the Swiss into security, then dividing their councils, and finally, when an army had been concentrated for that purpose, falling upon the canton of Bern, and seizing its public treasury; on which occasion Brune forgot to draw up an inventory of the plunder. Again, by dint of manoeuvres, bearing a diplomatic rather than a military character, he forced Charles Emmanuel, the king of Sardinia, and the apparent ally of France, to deliver into his hands the citadel of Turin (July 3, 1798). The Batavian campaign,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> which lasted about 2 months, forms the great event of Brune's military life. In this campaign he defeated the combined English and Russian forces, under the command of the duke of York, who capitulated to him, promising to restore all the French prisoners taken by the English from the commencement of the anti-Jacobinic war. After the coup d'état of the 18th Brumaire,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> Bonaparte appointed Brune a member of the newly created council of state, and then despatched him against the royalists of Brittany.</p>
<p>Sent in 1800 to the army of Italy, Brune occupied 3 hostile camps, intrenched on the Volta, drove the enemy beyond this river, and took measures for crossing it instantly. According to his orders, the army was to effect its passage at 2 points, the right wing under Gen. Dupont between a mill situated on the Volta and the village of Pozzolo, the left wing under Brune himself at Monbazon. The second part of the operations meeting with difficulties, Brune gave orders to delay its execution for 24 hours, although the right wing, which had commenced crossing on the other point, was already engaged with far superior Austrian forces. It was only due to Gen. Dupont's exertions that the right wing was not destroyed or captured, and thus the success of the whole campaign imperilled. This blunder led to his recall to Paris.</p>
<p>From 1802 to 1804 he cut a sorry figure as ambassador at Constantinople, where his diplomatic talents were not, as in Switzerland and Piedmont, backed by bayonets. On his return to Paris, in Dec. 1804, Napoleon created him marshal in preference to generals like Lecourbe. Having for a while commanded the camp at Boulogne,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> he was, in 1807, sent to Hamburg as governor of the Hanseatic towns, and as commander of the reserve of the grand army.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup> In this quality he vigorously seconded Bourrienne in his peculations. In order to settle some contested points of a truce concluded with Sweden at Schlatkow, he had a long personal interview with King Gustavus, who, in fact, proposed to him to betray his master. The manner in which he declined this offer raised the suspicions of Napoleon, who became highly incensed when Brune, drawing up a convention relating to the surrender of the island of Rügen to the French, mentioned simply the French and the Swedish armies as parties to the agreement, without any allusion to his "imperial and royal majesty."<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup> Brune was instantly recalled by a letter of Berthier, in which the latter, on the express order of Napoleon, stated</p>
<p>"that such a scandal had never occurred since the days of Pharamond."<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>On his return to France, he retired into private life. In 1814 he gave his adhesion to the acts of the senate,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup> and received the cross of St. Louis from Louis XVIII. During the Hundred Days<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" id="cite_ref-18">[18]</a></sup> he became again a Bonapartist, and received the command of a corps of observation on the Var, where he displayed against the royalists the brutal vigor of his Jacobin epoch. After the battle of Waterloo<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" id="cite_ref-19">[19]</a></sup> he proclaimed the king.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" id="cite_ref-20">[20]</a></sup> Starting from Toulon for Paris, he arrived at Avignon, on Aug. 2, at a moment when that town had for 15 days been doomed to carnage and incendiary fires by the royalist mob. Being recognized by them, he was shot, the mob seizing his corpse, dragging it through the streets, and throwing it into the Rhône.</p>
<p>"Brune, Masséna, Augereau, and many others," said Napoleon at St. Helena, "were intrepid depredators."<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" id="cite_ref-21">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>In regard to his military talents he remarks:</p>
<p>"Brune was not without a certain merit, but, on the whole, he was a general de tribune rather than a terrible warrior."<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" id="cite_ref-22">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>A monument was erected to him in his native town in 1841.

It derived its name from the former convent of Franciscan Cordeliers where its members met. Its official name was the Société des amis des droits de l'homme et du citoyen (Society of the Friends of the Rights of Man and the Citizen). With the Jacobin Club it played an important part in France's political life. Originally it united representatives of various trends which later on made up the Right (Dantonist) and the Left (Hébertist) wing of the Jacobins. With the growth of the revolution the Left elements prevailed. During the revolutionary-democratic Jacobin dictatorship the club was the stronghold of the Hébertists, existing until March 1794.</span>

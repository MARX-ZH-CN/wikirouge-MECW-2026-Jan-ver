<p>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>Would you oblige me by inserting the following few lines in your next publication?</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,
</p>
<p><i><b>K. Marx</b></i></p><center>
<p>To the Editor of The Pall Mall Gazette
</p>
</center><p>Sir,</p>
<p>From the Paris correspondence of your yesterday's publication, I see that while fancying to live at London, I was, in reality, arrested in Holland on the request of Bismarck-Favre. But, maybe, this is but one of the innumerable sensational stories about the <i>International</i> which for the last two months the Franco-Prussian police has never tired of fabricating, the Versailles press of publishing, and the rest of the European press of reproducing.</p>
<p>I have the honour, Sir, to be</p>
<p>Yours obediently,</p>
<p><i><b>Karl Marx</b></i></p>
<p>1, Modena Villas, Maitland Park.<br>June 8, 1871

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN HANOVER<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>[London,] 20 July 1867</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>I am writing these lines in haste, in the hope that they may still find you in Hanover. <i>C'est une chose brûlante.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>Old Lafargue<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>has invited my 3 daughters to Bordeaux (they depart tomorrow with the <i>secrétaire</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>), whence they will go with him and his wife to a seaside resort. It was all the harder for me to refuse as the state of health of all 3 girls made this invitation a real blessing. But propriety required that the <i>secrétaire de l'Espagne</i> should not be allowed to pay the expenses of the journey. The latter (return) approximately £30, which I thus had to disburse to him. Furthermore, their watches, dresses, etc., had to be reclaimed from the pawnshop. In this way, the £45 which I had in reserve for the rent on 3 August <i>(bill drawn on myself)</i> melted into thin air.</p>
<p>I can now think of no other recourse than writing to you. If the letter catches you, please write to me at once <i>with enclosure to Borkheim</i> asking him to advance me the money.</p>
<p>While you are in Germany you must read: 'Zwölf Streiter der Revolution von Gustav Struve und Gustav Rasch'. Under the heading of the 'fighting revolutionary' Freiligrath, you will find a fresh instance of this fine fellow's treachery towards us.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

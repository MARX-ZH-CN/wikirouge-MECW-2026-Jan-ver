The translation was the work of Stanislaw Krusihski, Kazimierz Plawinski, Mieczyslaw Brzezinski, Jôsef Siemaszko, Kazimierz Sosnowski, representatives of Polish revolutionary youth, as well as Krzywicki himself, who edited the entire translation. The first instalment appeared in 1884, the second in 1886 and the third in 1889. The book was published in full in 1890 in Leipzig, and one copy of this edition was sent to Engels.</span>

ENGELS TO JOHANN PHILIPP BECKER</p>
<p>IN GENEVA</p>
<p>London, 9 August 1882</p>
<p>Dear Old Man,</p>
<p>I had no opportunity yesterday of taking out a money order for you. But I did so first thing today and you will be paid <i>£5</i> sterling over there, which, according to the table, equals 126 frs. I was very glad to get another letter from you and hear how you are getting on. I, too, would give I don't know how much if you, Marx and I could foregather once more, but this year it's unlikely I shall have any such luck. There might still be a chance of your seeing Marx this summer, but that depends on where the doctors send him. I shall have to postpone the rest of my reply for a day or two as it's nearly time for the post and I still have to write at some length to Bernstein about this and that.</p>
<p>In the meantime keep yourself hale and hearty as always. Kindest regards.</p>
<p>Your old friend</p>
<p>F. Engels

ENGELS TO LAURA MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>Manchester, 23 September 1867
<br>Dear Löhrchen,
<br>I have received your delightful letter, and as soon as the books arrived I despatched the various copies<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> to their resp. recipients— those to Imandt and Strohn sent securely packed by BOOK POST, but the one intended for me, for which my best thanks to Moor, straight to the binders.
<br>You will be interested to learn that a week ago last Saturday I already showed Lafargue<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> the battlefield where the great Fenian liberation battle was enacted the previous Wednesday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> We were actually within ten paces of the railway arch; however, he will scarcely recollect it.
<br>So that you may see what man, and cotton-man in particular, is capable of, I am sending you enclosed the latest abomination of this kind in the form of a cotton sheen-wig. These GUYS are now being made and sold in colossal quantities.
<br>Your friend has been successfully elected at Schneeberg in Saxony to the great North German Reichstag against Count zur Lippe, and will no doubt soon be making a great maiden speech. THE RIGHT MAN IN THE RIGHT PLACE.
<br>With hearty greetings to the whole family, most sincerely
<br>Your
<br>F. Engels

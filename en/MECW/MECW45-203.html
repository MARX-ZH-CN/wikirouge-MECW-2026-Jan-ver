<br><i>To Wilhelm Blos in Hamburg</i>

<h4 class="mw-headline" id="London.2C_10_November_1877_41_Maitland_Park_Road.2C_N._W.">London, 10 November 1877 41 Maitland Park Road, N. W.</h4><a id="London,_10_November_1877_41_Maitland_Park_Road,_N._W."></a>
<br>Dear Blos,
<br>I was delighted to hear from you [<em>Dir</em>] again at last (that '<em>Dir</em>' slipped naturally from my pen. So do drop the <em>Sie</em> in future). I had long since proposed that the abominable Isolde be dismissed, and fulminated against her in vain.
<br>Whenever, in '<em>la Place</em>', the word <em>place</em> is written with a capital P, it always means the <em>Place Vendôme</em>, that being the seat of the commander of the National Guard; in Paris at the time he was the equivalent of what we call 'town-major'.
<br>As regards the '<em>suppression de 1'État</em>', an expression which Lissagaray himself will be altering in the 2nd French edition [of <em>History of the Paris Commune of 1871</em>], the sense is no different from that expounded in my pamphlet on the 'Civil War' in France. In short, you can translate it 'abolition (or suppression) of the class state'.
<br>I 'bear no ill-will' (as Heine says) and nor for that matter does Engels. Neither of us cares a straw for popularity. Let me cite one proof of this: such was my aversion to the personality cult that at the time of the International, when plagued by numerous moves — originating from various countries — to accord me public honour, I never allowed one of these to enter the domain of publicity, nor did I ever reply to them, save with an occasional snub. When Engels and I first joined the secret communist society, we did so only on condition that anything conducive to a superstitious belief in authority be eliminated from the Rules. (Lassalle subsequently operated in the reverse direction.)
<br>But events such as occurred at the last party congress — they are being well and truly exploited by enemies of the party abroad — have in any case made it necessary for us to be circumspect in our relations with 'party members in Germany'.
<br>Apart from that, my state of health compels me to devote to the completion of my book [<em>Capital</em>] the time allotted to me for work by my doctor; and Engels, who is working on several longer books, is still sending contributions to the <em>Vorwärts</em>.
<br>It would amuse me to hear more from time to time about my 'combinations with Father Beckx'.
<br>Engels will be writing to you shortly.
<br>With warm regards from my wife and my daughter Eleanor.
<br>Tous tuus,<br>Karl Marx

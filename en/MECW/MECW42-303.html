<p>Dear Kugelmann</p>
<p>Were there six people of your calibre in Germany, the resistance of the philistine mass and the <i>conspiration de silence</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> of the experts and newspaper crowd would have been so far broken down that at least some serious discussion would have begun. <i>Mais il faut attendre!</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> In these words lies the whole secret of <i>Russian policy</i>. I am enclosing a letter (please return it) from a German-Russian worker (a tanner).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Engels remarks, quite rightly, that the autodidactic philosophy – pursued by workers themselves – has made great progress in the case of this tanner in comparison with the cobbler Jakob Böhm;<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> also that only 'German workers' are capable of such cerebral work.</p>
<p>Borkheim<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> asked me yesterday who had written the article in the <i>Zukunft</i> (he is a subscriber). It must come from one of our people, since you had sent him a copy of it. I said <i>I did not know</i>. <i>Nota bene!</i> One should not put all one's cards on the table.</p>
<p>My most cordial thanks to your dear wife for the trouble she took in copying the letter. You should not exploit her so much for 'surplus labour'.</p>
<p>Bucher,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> as, if I am not mistaken, I have already told you, has himself asked me to be the <i>economic correspondent of the Royal Prussian Staatszeitung</i>. So you see that if I <i>wanted</i> to make use of such sources, I could do so without the mediation of a third person.</p>
<p>My illness is the old one – nothing dangerous, but troublesome.</p>
<p>With best greetings to your dear wife and Fränzchen.</p>
<p>Yours</p>
<p>K Marx

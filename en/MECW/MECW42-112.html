<p><i>To Engels in Manchester</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 20 November 1865</b></p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Little Jenny is on the mend again now and thanks you very much for the wine.</p>
<p>Regarding the financial questions, it would be futile to approach Dronke about it. To have some peace with the <b>landlord</b>, and that is at the root of it all, I have persuaded him to take a bill of exchange up till the middle of February for the current quarter, for which I owe him 2/3. As for the other creditors, I have satisfied the most pressing with the £15 and am considering ways and means of putting together at least an instalment for the others. Your offer is very generous, and as soon as my work [Capital] is finished and out, the remainder will have to be made up through other commitments, or if that should not succeed, <i>although I fully expect it will</i>, we shall have to move somewhere cheaper, perhaps to Switzerland.</p>
<p>The Berlin letter is genuine [re an impending split in the German Workers' Association]. Some days after it arrived, I received a letter about it from Liebknecht, who is in continuous contact with the Berliners. It also emerges from Liebknecht's letter that those curs from the <i>Social-Demokrat</i> would oh so dearly love to resume their ties with us. The kind of illusions Liebknecht is for ever indulging in can be seen from the following passage:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>'the people that have applied to you from Berlin, are our friends. If you could come, show yourself but once — the gain would be immense. Come if it is possible.'*</li></ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Surely Liebknecht ought to know that even if I could go to Berlin <b>at present</b>, just as a <b>visitor</b>, I would have to be completely quiet and keep myself to myself and not address workers' clubs!</p>
<p>Liebknecht also writes:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>'Professor <i>Eckardt'*</i> (now the 'Principal' radical in the south, as a letter from Stumpf in Mainz makes clear) *'of Mannheim places the <i>Wochenblatt</i> at our disposal. He would be delighted if you and Engels were to write for it a few articles, but not too strong.'*</li></ul>
</blockquote>
<p><i>The Workman's Advocate</i> is as weak as ever. However, it must have some appeal as it appeared in a larger format last week. I know no more details, as I shall be present at the Association again for the first time tomorrow. The Parisians have published a report on the <i>conference</i> together with the <i>programme</i> we drew up for the next congress. It appeared in <i>all</i> the liberal, quasi-liberal and republican papers in Paris. You will see what a friendly reception it had from the following report by Fox on the last meeting of our <b>Council</b> which I am cutting out of <i>The Workman's Advocate</i> for you. Our Parisians are somewhat taken aback that the para. on Russia and Poland which they did <i>not</i> wish to have, is the very one to create the biggest stir. I hope that you will now use some of your leisure time to write the occasional article on one subject or another for the <i>Advocate.</i></p>
<p>The Paris publication absolves me from the trouble of writing a report on France.</p>
<p>The Jamaican business is typical of the utter turpitude of the '<b>true Englishman</b>'. These fellows are as bad as the Russians in every respect. But, says the good old <i>Times,</i> these <b>damned rogues enjoyed 'all the liberties of an Anglo-Saxon Constitution'.</b> I.e. they <b>enjoyed the liberty</b>, amongst others, of having their hides taxed to raise money for the <b>planters</b> to import <b>coolies</b> and thus depress their own labour market below the minimum. And these English curs with their sensibilities sent up an outcry about '<b>beast</b> Butler' for hanging <i>one</i> man! and refusing to allow the former planters' diamond-spangled yellow womenfolk to spit in the faces of the <b>Federal soldiers</b>! The Irish affair and the Jamaica <b>butcheries</b> were all that was needed after the American war to complete the unmasking of English hypocrisy!</p>
<p>Please do not forget to obtain the necessary data from Knowles for me (and <i>as soon as possible</i>). <b>Average weekly wages</b>, either for a <b>mule spinner</b>, or for a female <b>throstle</b> spinner; <i>how much</i> yarn (or <i>cotton,</i> that is, <i>including</i> the <i>déchet</i> that is lost in spinning) is spun <i>per week</i> <b>on average</b> by an <b>average number</b> (Or, for that matter, any number) by each individual; and then, of course, an arbitrary (corresponding to the labour-wage) <i>price</i> for the cotton and the <i>price of yarn.</i> I cannot write out the second chapter until I have these details.</p>
<p>Ernest Jones' address is now 47 Princess Street.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i></p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.

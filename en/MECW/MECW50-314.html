ENGELS TO RICHARD FISCHER</p>
<p>IN BERLIN</p>
<p>Eastbourne, 29 June 1895<br>4 Royal Parade</p>
<p>Dear Fischer, The Mosel articles 584 have arrived safely in London.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>Thank you. Unfortunately I can say nothing definite about completing the ms. or about the introduction which can only be done in London, since I am in no condition to do any work, nor do I know how long I shall continue to be held up by these processes which, while they may be normal at my age, are hideously slow. The weather has been finer here than the farmers would like; at this place, in particular, there's a positive drought. Regards to your wife and children.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F. E.

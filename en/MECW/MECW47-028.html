ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT</p>
<p>IN BORSDORF NEAR L E I P Z I G "</p>
<p>[Eastbourne,] 21 August 1883</p>
<p>Dear Liebknecht,</p>
<p>Your letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>has remained unanswered because of final work on the 3rd edition,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>after which I came to stay here at</p>
<p>4 Cavendish Place, Eastbourne, England where I intend to remain until about 12 September.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Mrs Marx died on 2 December 1881, Jenny on 9 January 1883. Both deaths were reported in the <i>Sozialdemokrat}</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Paris <i>Vorwärts!</i> was a little sheet which is now being accorded more importance than it deserves; the editors were a dilatory lot. Marx's main concern was to keep it on the right lines and from time to time he also wrote polemical articles and reviews attacking the Prussians.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>Heine sent Marx some of the advance proofs of the <i>Winter- märchen</i> from Hamburg for publication in the <i>Vorwärts!</i> before the book appeared in Germany.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>I actually only set eyes on a few numbers and the little paper did not survive for long, so I cannot let you have any further de- tails.</p>
<p>Marx wrote quite a lot of things for the <i>Deutsche-Brüsseler-Zeitung,</i> including a polemical discourse against Heinzen.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Bebel's letter safely received; will be answered from here<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>; along with all the other correspondence, have been unable to attend to it because of overwork. Tell Bebel that Schorlemmer, who is here, will be going to Darmstadt shortly and staying there until about the mid- dle of September. If Bebel is visiting those parts before then, Schor- lemmer would like him to let him know (Prof. Schorlemmer, Darm-</p>
<p>Stadt is sufficient address) and tell him where Schorlemmer can meet him; in which case he will do his utmost to look him up. Lafargue finished half his time today.<sup>9</sup></p>

He further requested Marx to write an introduction to this poem to appear in<i> Vorwärts!</i> In October 1844 the newspaper started to publish the poem, preceded by an editorial article probably written by Karl Ludwig Bernays.</span>

ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY</p>
<p>IN D E A L</p>
<p>London, 6 August 1886</p>
<p>Dear Kautsky,</p>
<p>We leave tomorrow for Eastbourne. Address 4 Cavendish Place, as before.</p>
<p>Have just booked a passage for Liebknecht on the Cunard STEAMER <i>Servia</i> and sent him the receipt.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>You will find your MONEY ORDER here in an addressed envelope. Also sundry American <i>Sozialists</i> for yourself and sundry American <i>Volks-Zeitungs</i> along with the <i>Missouri Republican</i> containing the outrageous interview — please keep these <i>Volkszeitungs</i> and the <i>Republican</i> for me.</p>
<p>Will you please — when you get back — continue to forward my letters, etc., at regular intervals, i.e. <i>at most</i> every other day, but as a rule twice a week, just as you did before?</p>
<p>The translation of the ms.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> was finally completed yesterday; 23 sheets have been set up and the proofs are in hand.</p>
<p>Liebknecht is sailing from Liverpool on 4 September, the Avelings on 31 August.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> We shall be staying here until 28 August for certain and if possible a week longer; it depends on Liebknecht's arrival and other possible visitors.</p>
<p>You will have read about the sentences in Freiberg<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> — 6 months for Dietz, Heinzel and Müller, 9 for the others.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> Typically German.</p>
<p>Thank you for your news from Vienna. Otherwise all is tranquil while the world takes a breather, the one exception being the Russians who are surreptitiously intriguing away for all they are worth. Giers evidently intends to wangle something worthwhile out of Bismarck this year, but I don't imagine he will succeed.</p>
<p>Kindest regards to your wife.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F.E.

Eleanor Marx-Aveling and Edward Aveling made a trip around the United States at approximately the same time (see Note 601). Liebknecht stayed in Eastbourne with Engels for four days, left Liverpool on 4 September and arrived in New York on 13 September where he met the Avelings. In New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Detroit, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Washington and other cities he gave talks and lectures on the theory and history of socialism, the state of the workers' movement in Europe and other subjects. This trip, which he completed on 26 November, raised 16,000 marks for the German Social Democrats' election fund. On his way back to Germany, Liebknecht stayed with Engels in London from 5 to 10 December, following which he set off on his way home to Borsdorf near Leipzig.</span>

Not long before his death Engels dictated to Eduard Bernstein a list of manuscripts from his own and Marx's literary legacy and of other materials stored in his archives. The list contained the following note, '... manuscript of<i> The German Ideology'</i> ('Stirner, 1845/46, Moor and I', 'Feuerbach and Bauer, 1846/47, Moor and I',<i> 'True Socialism,</i> 1847, Moor and I').</span>

On 4 August 1886 the local provincial court sentenced Ignaz Auer, August Bebel, Carl Ulrich, Louis Viereck, Georg Heinrich von Vollmar and Karl Franz Egon Frohme to nine months', as well as Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Dietz, Philipp Heinrich Müller and Stefan Heinzel, to six months' imprisonment on a charge of belonging to a 'secret society'. Bebel served his prison sentence in Zwickau from mid-November 1886 to 14 August 1887.</span>

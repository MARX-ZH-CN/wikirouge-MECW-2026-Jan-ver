<br>Dear Mr Mehring,
<br>Naturally I have not the slightest objection to your printing the passage from my letter of 28 September you copied out and sent me. All I would ask is that you make one change in the final sentence: 'while the Lavergne-Peguilhenian generalisation would be reduced to its true content, namely that feudal society engenders a feudal world order'.  The original wording is really too slipshod.
<br>I am glad that <em>The Lessing Legend</em> has appeared as a separate book; works of this kind suffer greatly from being broken up. It was highly creditable on your part to have worked through the chaos of Prussian history and indicated the correct interconnections; current realities in Prussia make this absolutely necessary, no matter how unpleasant the work is in itself. I am not in complete agreement with your opinion on certain points, particularly in places concerning the causal links with the preceding period, but this does not prevent your book from being by far the best there is on this period of German history.
<br>Yours very truly, F.
<br>Engels

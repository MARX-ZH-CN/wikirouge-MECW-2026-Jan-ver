ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 21 April 1870</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Enclosed, returned, the Swiss letters. The Genevans are, at all events, rather sluggish, otherwise they would not have got into this unfortunate position with the Bakuninists formally having the rules on their side with regard to them. This does not, of course, alter the fact that the Genevans must remain in the right; but, for the time being, the General Council has no reason to intervene, since the Genevans have appealed for a ballot in the <i>sections,</i> and you will have to wait for the result of this, one way or the other, before making a decision. The Bakuninists will probably not let themselves in for this referendum, since their <i>règlement fédéral</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> probably makes no mention of it, and they will, thereby, expose their weak point in wishing to sacrifice the unity of the International, and the International itself into the bargain, to their empty formalism. Then there would be reason enough to intervene. On the other hand, the Genevans themselves must see to it this time that they gain the majority in their plebiscite. Till then, the General Council could, at the most, suspend <i>both</i> central committees, and replace them by a neutral provisional one (Becker,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> etc.).</p>
<p>In the matter itself it is clear that the Alliance, even if tolerated by the General Council, has no place in a local organisation like the <i>Suisse Romande,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> since it wishes to correspond with all countries and maintain sub-sections there. Thus it should either stay out of it, or abandon its international character. Whereas, if the business in Switzerland continues to develop, the result will be either that it leaves the International completely, or can be thrown out. But it must be impressed on the Messrs Genevans that they cannot be helped unless they help themselves. If Bakunin were to get a majority of the workers of the <i>Suisse Romande</i> on his side, what could the General Council do? The only conceivable point is that of the total abstinence from all politics, but even this action would not be so certain.</p>
<p>The Messrs Genevans might have kept their <i>God</i> in the bag too!<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

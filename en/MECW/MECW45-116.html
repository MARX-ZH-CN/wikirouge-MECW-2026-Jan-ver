ENGELS TO ERNST DRONKE
<br>IN WATERLOO
<br>[Copy]
<br>[London,] 20 October 1876
<br><i>To Dronke</i>
<br>My brother-in-law Blank writes to say that he absolutely and categorically refuses to enter into a transaction such as you suggest.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Furthermore, he tells me he severed all connections with Hinsberg, Fischer &amp; Co. three years ago, as is indeed the case.
<br>I am sorry that nothing has come of the matter, since I should have liked to help you in so far as it was in my power to do so.

ENGELS TO ERNST DRONKE</p>
<p>IN WATERLOO</p>
<p>[Copy]</p>
<p>[London,] 20 October 1876</p>
<p><i>To Dronke</i></p>
<p>My brother-in-law Blank writes to say that he absolutely and categorically refuses to enter into a transaction such as you suggest.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>Furthermore, he tells me he severed all connections with Hinsberg, Fischer &amp; Co. three years ago, as is indeed the case.</p>
<p>I am sorry that nothing has come of the matter, since I should have liked to help you in so far as it was in my power to do so.

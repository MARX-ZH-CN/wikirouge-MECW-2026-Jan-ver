ENGELS TO MARX<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 8 May 1870</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>With his plot-comedy, Mr Pietri appears to me to have far overshot the mark. In the end the policemen don't even believe one another's buffoonery. It's really too fine. This scurvy Bonaparte has a fixed remedy for every sickness; in case of a plebiscite, the <i>populus</i> must be given a dose of assassination, just as every quack begins every bigger treatment with a strong laxative. I am longing to hear the result of the treatment; so far I know only about the Paris vote, which was so good that all forgeries by officials could not falsify it completely.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <i>Daily News</i> and <i>Observer</i> virtually announced that the English police had obtained the necessary and telegraphed it to the French police. With the FENIAN SCARE the English police have completely dropped their disguise and are baser than any other. NB. Do use thinner paper for your envelopes; I could open these thick envelopes without leaving a trace.</p>
<p>You really should publish in France and Germany the heroic deeds of the English police regarding the International and Flourens.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>10,000 COPIES=£40 is damned cheap; I would have expected <i>The Standard</i> to sell itself dearer. This manner of bribery has, however, long been common here.</p>
<p>Flerovsky<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>does not appear to have been confiscated; there are copies at least in Leipzig. My bookseller, the jackass, did not order the Russian text but a non-existent English translation. Hence the non-arrival.</p>
<p>So <i>Колокол</i> [Kolokol] will be even finer under Bakunin than it was under Herzen.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Monsieur Wilhelm<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>is no longer to be borne. You will have seen that 'owing to the absence of the printer' (who is, thus, the real editor), the <i>Peasant War</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>was printed in a mix-up that Grandperret could not have managed better and, at the same time, the dunderhead has the impudence to affix marginal notes that are complete nonsense, without any note as to authorship, and <i>everyone will ascribe them to me.</i> I have already forbidden him to do this once before, and he was piqued; but the nonsense is laid on so thick that it is no longer bearable. <i>Ad vocem</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>Hegel, the fellow glosses: known to the general public as the discoverer (!) and glorifier (!!) of the royal Prussian <i>state concept</i> (!!!). I have retorted to him suitably, and have sent him, for publication, a declaration as mild as was possible under the circumstances. This dunderhead, who has been jogging around helplessly for years on the ridiculous contradiction between right and might, like an infantry man placed upon a horse with the staggers and locked in the riding-school—this ignoramus has the insolence to wish to dispatch a man like Hegel with the word 'Preuss'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>and, at the same time, suggests to the public that I had said it. I have now had enough of the whole thing. If Wilhelm doesn't publish my declaration, I shall turn to his superiors, the 'Committee',<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>and if they also get up to tricks, I shall prohibit any further publication. I would rather not be published than let Wilhelm proclaim me a jackass thereby.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Borkheim, returned enclosed. The fellow is gracious enough to wish to find Lever<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup>jocose. 'Boquillon'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup>is very nice; I haven't yet read the other things.</p>
<p>I can tell you nothing about Schapper<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup>that you do not know yourself or you could not get much better from Pfänder.</p>
<p>The <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i> has been gammoned into writing that the floor of the Atlantic Ocean is covered with protoplasm—'a moving slime that nourishes itself.'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>In LONDON CLAY, Owen has found the skull of a giant bird, similar to the great wingless birds of New Zealand.</p>
<p>The jolliest point about old Irish law<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup>is the family law. Those must have been free-and-easy times. Polygamy existed, was at least <i>tolerated,</i> and the concubines here were divided into 6-7 classes, including one, the <i>imris,</i> 'WHOM HE (THE MAN) HAS WITH THE CONSENT OF HER HUSBAND'. Very naive, too, is the regulation about the disposition of property. If they both have the same amount, the husband and (the first or main) wife dispose of it jointly. If the husband has everything and the wife nothing, the husband disposes. Has the wife all and the husband nothing, then 'the wife takes the position of the husband, and the husband that of the wife'. Yet still more civilised than the modern English laws.</p>
<p>The legal position of <i>hommes entretenus</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup>is also defined. Best greetings.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p>Don't talk about grey hairs. They are growing thickly enough in my beard, but the corresponding <i>dignitas</i> simply won't appear.

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Engels is referring to preparations for the so-called plebiscite which Napoleon III hoped to use to consolidate his somewhat shaky position. On 20 April 1870, the government made public a new constitution which was a compromise between the authoritarian and the parliamentary systems. It was followed by a decree on 23 April, which proposed that the French people use the plebiscite to approve or reject the following: 'The People approves the liberal reforms effected in the Constitution since 1860 by the Emperor, with the cooperation of the great bodies of the State, and ratifies the <i>Senatus-Consultus</i> of the 20th April 1870.' The issue was worded in such a way that a positive answer to it would sound like an approval of the overall political structure of the Second Empire. As a result of a plebiscite held on 8 May 1870, about 3.5 million citizens in fact opposed the Empire (1,894,681 abstained, and 1,577,939 voted against). A large share of the votes against the Empire belonged to the French army; in Paris alone, 46,000 servicemen gave a negative answer.</span>

After Herzen's death in 1870, an attempt to keep up the newspaper was made by Sergei Nechayev, who was in close contact with Bakunin. This is probably what Marx means. Six issues appeared in April-May 1870.</span>

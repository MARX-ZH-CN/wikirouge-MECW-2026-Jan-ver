ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>[Manchester,] 20[-21] February 1865
<br>Dear Moor,
<br>The letter from Matzeratt enclosed.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br><i>Quant à</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Petzler, so the photographer is an altogether different Petzler from the other one. I saw the photographer, you know, the day before yesterday, at a scientific soirée at the Schiller Institute,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> and the fellow is at least 20 years younger and looks quite different. Heaven knows what has become of the musician.
<br>Your
<br>F.E.
<br>[Pencilled note on the reverse of the letter]
<br>Quite forgot to post the letter yesterday. No ANSWER VET FROM HAMBURG.<sup>0</sup>

Engels was critical of the Institute, noted for its tendency to formalism and pedantry, and he initially kept aloof from it. But when certain changes were introduced into its Rules, he became a member of its Directorate in 1864. Later, as the President of the Institute, Engels devoted much time to it and exercised a considerable influence on its activities.<br>In September 1868, while Engels was away from Manchester, the Institute invited Karl Vogt, who was connected with the Bonapartists and was slandering the proletarian revolutionaries, to deliver a lecture. Engels felt that his political reputation would be compromised if he remained President and so he left the Directorate. In April 1870 he was again elected a member of the Directorate of the Schiller Institute, but did not take an active part in it.</br></span>

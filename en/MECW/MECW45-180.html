ENGELS TO FRANZ WIEDE</p>
<p>IN ZURICH</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[Ramsgate, 25 July 1877]</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Pray excuse me for, etc. Now, as regards my collaboration on your projected journal,<sup>3</sup> I can, unfortunately, promise you nothing definite at the moment.</p>
<p>As soon as I have completed my critique of Dühring for the <i>Vorwärts,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I shall be obliged to concentrate my whole attention on a longer, independent work which I have had in mind for years, one of the obstacles to its completion hitherto—aside from extraneous circumstances—having been my collaboration on socialist organs. When a man has totted up 56 years, he must finally make up his mind to take stock of his time so that something may finally come of his preliminary labours. Should an isolated case occur in which I again deemed it necessary to cast my vote in public, it would depend on the circumstances <i>where</i> this should be done, whether in the <i>Vorwärts</i> or elsewhere, and in this latter case I should, among all the various 'scientific journals' now being projected, be happy, in so far as I can now predict, to turn to yours first. If, therefore, I feel unable to make any firmer promise today, I would beg you to ascribe this solely to the reasons adduced above, and in no way to a want of sympathy for a journal which greatly interests me, to which I wish all prosperity and to which I have already subscribed through my bookseller.</p>
<p>I am, Sir, etc.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The publication of Eugen Dühring's <i>Cursus der Philosophie als streng wissenschlicher Weltanschauung und Lebensgestaltung</i> and the second edition of his <i>Kritische Geschichte der Nationalökonomie und des Sozialismus</i> (1875) made his views very popular in Germany. Among the German Social-Democrats, he acquired such followers as Johann Most, Friedrich Wilhelm Fritzsche, and Eduard Bernstein. Even August Bebel came under his influence for a short time. In view of this, in his letters to Engels of 1 February and 21 April 1875, Liebknecht proposed that the latter use <i>Der Volksstaat</i> to criticise Dühring's views.
Engels did so for the first time in the essay 'Prussian Schnapps in the German Reichstag' carried by <i>Der Volksstaat</i> in February 1876 (see present edition, Vol. 24).
Marx agreed with Engels that Dühring's views had to be exposed to serious criticism. Engels interrupted the work on <i>Dialectics of Nature</i> which he had begun in May 1873 and made a start on <i>Anti-Dühring</i> (see present edition, Vol. 25). It took him over two years, from May 1876 to July 1878, to complete it. Part I of the book was mainly written between September 1876 and January 1877 and was printed in the <i>Vorwärts</i> as a series of articles under the heading <i>Herrn Eugen Dühring's Umwälzung der Philosophie</i> in January-May 1877.
Part II was written in July-August 1877. Marx contributed Chapter X. This part was published under the heading <i>Herrn Eugen Dühring's Umwälzung der politischen Oekonomie</i> in the <i>Wissenschaftliche Beilage</i> and the supplement to the <i>Vorwärts</i> in July-December 1877.
Part III was written mostly between August 1877 and April 1878 and appeared in the <i>Vorwärts</i> in May-July 1878 under the title <i>Herrn Eugen Dühring's Umwälzung des Sozialismus.</i>
The book aroused strong resistance on the part of Dühring's followers. At a regular party congress held in Gotha from 27 to 29 May 1877, they tried to prevent the publication of Engels' work in the party's central organ. <i>Anti-Dühring</i> appeared in the newspaper with lengthy intervals.
In July 1877, Part I of the book was published in Leipzig as a separate pamphlet. In July 1878, Parts II and III were also published there as a separate pamphlet. The first complete edition of <i>Anti-Dühring,</i> with Engels' preface, appeared at the same time.
In late October 1878, following the introduction of the Anti-Socialist Law in Germany, <i>Anti-Dühring</i> was banned along with Engels' other works.</span>

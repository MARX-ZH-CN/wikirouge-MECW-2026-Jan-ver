ENGELS TO KARL HÖCHBERG
<br>IN SCHEVENINGEN510
<br>Eastbourne, 26 August 1879
<br>Dear Mr Höchberg,
<br>As I do not know how long you will be staying in Scheveningen, I hasten to advise you in reply that you have been misled in regard to the information allegedly given us by C. Hirsch. He did not assure us that the new newspaper was to be 'your private property', or that it was to 'adopt a moderate attitude'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Our view of the affair is based, not upon Hirsch's assurances, but upon our appraisal of all the relevant correspondence conducted between Leipzig and Zurich on the one hand and C. Hirsch on the other. I must refrain from going into the whole comedy of errors these letters represent, and in which nobody has been more blameless than Hirsch. In my view his conduct in the whole affair has been perfectly rational, frank and honourable. Hence I must wholeheartedly approve of his decision to refuse the editorship on the terms mooted which have not yet even been settled between the interested parties in Leipzig and Zurich, and at this juncture my only concern is to deflect from him a reproach he does not deserve.
<br>With Social-Democratic greetings,
<br>Yours faithfully,
<br>F. Engels
<br>Back in London as from day after tomorrow 496

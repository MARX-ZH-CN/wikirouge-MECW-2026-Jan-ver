MARX TO NIKOLAI DANIELSON
<br>IN ST PETERSBURG
<br>London, 19 September 1879<br>41 Maitland Park Road, Haverstock Hill, N. W.
<br>My dear Sir,
<br>I have just returned to London after almost two months rustication in the isle of Jersey<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and at other sea-side places.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I was forced to do so and suspend all work during that time on medical advice because of nervous derangement. For this reason I was also unable to do justice to the mental food you were so kind as to forward me, but now I feel much reinvigorated and shall set at work with a will.
<br>The book of Kowalewsky I got from himself.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> He is one of my 'scientific' friends who every year comes to London in order to explore the treasures of the British Museum.
<br>You will receive a longer letter so soon as I have disposed of some urgent work accumulated during my absence. In the meantime, with my best wishes
<br>Yours sincerely
<br>A. Williams<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>

Marx began a study of the work in October, making detailed notes on the nature of the commune and its place and socio-economic role in different epochs and among different nations.</span>

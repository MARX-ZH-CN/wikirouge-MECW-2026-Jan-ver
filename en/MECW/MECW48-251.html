ENGELS TO CHARLES ROSHER</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London, before 19 January 1890] [Draft]</p>
<p>Dear Charles,</p>
<p>Within two months of your engaging Percy you wrote to me asking for a loan, and in terms which hardly could leave any doubt of your intention to terminate that engagement unless I acceded to your wish.</p>
<p>And as soon as I had replied in the negative, you did terminate it. You can hardly deny, that if you intended to convey the idea that the engage- ment was a mere preliminary to the loan, you could not have done it better. But you now say there was no connection whatever between the two, and of course I am bound to believe you.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely
RE.

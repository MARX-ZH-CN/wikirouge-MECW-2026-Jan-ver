ENGELS TO CHARLES ROSHER
<br>IN LONDON
<br>[London, before 19 January 1890] [Draft]
<br>Dear Charles,
<br>Within two months of your engaging Percy you wrote to me asking for a loan, and in terms which hardly could leave any doubt of your intention to terminate that engagement unless I acceded to your wish.
<br>And as soon as I had replied in the negative, you did terminate it. You can hardly deny, that if you intended to convey the idea that the engage- ment was a mere preliminary to the loan, you could not have done it better. But you now say there was no connection whatever between the two, and of course I am bound to believe you.
<br>Yours sincerely
RE.

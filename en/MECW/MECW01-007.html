<h3 class="mw-headline" id="The_Fiddler">The Fiddler</h3>
<br>The Fiddler saws the strings,
<br>His light brown hair he tosses and flings.
<br>   He carries a sabre at his side,
<br>   He wears a pleated habit wide.
<br>"Fiddler, why that frantic sound?
<br>Why do you gaze so wildly round?
<br>   Why leaps your blood, like the surging sea?
<br>   What drives your bow so desperately?"
<br>"Why do I fiddle? Or the wild waves roar?
<br>That they might pound the rocky shore,
<br>   That eye be blinded, that bosom swell,
<br>   That Soul's cry carry down to Hell."
<br>"Fiddler, with scorn you rend your heart.
<br>A radiant God lent you your art,
<br>   To dazzle with waves of melody,
<br>   To soar to the star-dance in the sky."
<br>"How so! I plunge, plunge without fail
<br>My blood-black sabre into your soul.
<br>   That art God neither wants nor wists,
<br>   It leaps to the brain from Hell's black mists.
<br>"Till heart's bewitched, till senses reel:
<br>With Satan I have struck my deal.
<br>   He chalks the signs, beats time for me,
<br>   I play the death march fast and free.
<br>"I must play dark, I must play light,
<br>Till bowstrings break my heart outright."
<br>   The Fiddler saws the strings,
<br>   His light brown hair he tosses and flings.
<br>   He carries a sabre at his side,
<br>   He wears a pleated habit wide.

<h3 class="mw-headline" id="Nocturnal_Love">Nocturnal Love</h3>
<br>Frantic, he holds her near,
<br>   Darkly looks in her eye.
<br>"Pain so burns you, Dear,
<br>   And at my breath you sigh.
<br>"Oh, you have drunk my soul.
<br>   Mine is your glow, in truth.
<br>My jewel, shine your fill.
<br>   Glow, blood of youth."
<br>"Sweetest, so pale your face,
<br>   So wondrous strange your words.
<br>See, rich in music's grace
<br>   The lofty gliding worlds."
<br>"Gliding, dearest, gliding,
<br>   Glowing, stars, glowing.
<br>Let us go heavenwards riding,
<br>   Our souls together flowing."
<br>His voice is muffled, low.
<br>   Desparate, he looks about.
<br>Glances of crackling flame
<br>His hollow eyes shoot out.
<br>"You have drunk poison, Love.
<br>   With me you must away.
<br>The sky is dark above,
<br>   No more I see the day."
<br>Shuddering, he pulls her close to him.
<br>   Death in the breast doth hover.
<br>Pain stabs her, piercing deep within,
<br>   And eyes are closed forever.

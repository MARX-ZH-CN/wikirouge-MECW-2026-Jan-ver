ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY</p>
<p>IN STUTTGART</p>
<p>London, 9 January 1894
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Baron,</p>
<p>Ede has doubtless already told you of the despatch of part of the ms. of Volume II I (approx. 1/3 of a cubic foot). Now that it has safely arrived in Hamburg, I am able to give you a short review of it for the <i>Neue Zeit</i> and this I enclose.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Please send a copy with <i>the article side-lined</i> to Otto Meissner's Verlag, Hamburg.</p>
<p>Work is continuing on the second third which I hope will soon be ready. Your good wishes for Xmas as well as for the New Year were gratefully reciprocated in thought if not in words.</p>
<p>I shall now probably be able to get hold of the Berne Convention.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I am anxious to see Cunow's book.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> The man has done a great deal of swotting in his field and keeps his eyes open.</p>
<p>Dietz will be interested to hear that Laura Lafargue is translating my <i>Feuerbach</i> into French for the <i>Ère nouvelle 310</i> and subsequent publication as an off-print. I have already looked over the first part. She translates deftly and conscientiously.</p>
<p>Rave, who is less deserving of such praise, has again written to me; he has had a go at your <i>Thomas Morus,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> <i>mais c'est bien indigeste!</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> For the man does not, in fact, possess an adequate knowledge of German, although he is an Alsatian and by rights should probably be called Rawe.</p>
<p>I'm glad that Victor should have promptly extracted the best bits from your latest article and made them available to the Viennese. 321 They were quite admirably suited to the situation there. According to Victor's last letter, all danger of anything silly being done is now past. In fact both the Czech and the trades union congresses have shelved the question of a GENERAL STRIKE 322 until the Party Conference 323 and Victor will doubtless make sure that it is shelved yet again.</p>
<p>That's all for today—masses of letters still to attend to. Regards from one household to the other.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F.E.

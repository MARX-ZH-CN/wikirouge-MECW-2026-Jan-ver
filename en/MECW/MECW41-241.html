MARX TO ENGELS
<br>IN MANCHESTER
<br>[London,] 14 August 1862
<br>Dear Frederick,
<br>Just a few lines as I have a mass of business errands to r u n today.
<br>T h e misunderstanding consists solely in there 'not having been one'.
<br>Before writing to you, I had told Borkheim that I did <i>not</i> know whether Lassalle was in Berlin, and hence that there was n o certainty of an immediate acceptance. Borkheim had, nevertheless, promised to DISCOUNT the moment he had your signature. H e subsequently thought better of it.
<br>H e decided, not to DISCOUNT in person, as he had originally intended, BUT TO HAVE THE BILL DISCOUNTED BY ONE OF HIS FRIENDS CONNECTED WITH BERLIN. * danger in delay
<br>T o that end, he naturally required Lassalle's acceptance. T h e latter, or so I learned from Bücher yesterday, is at present at Wildbad, where Lassalle SENIOR<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> is more or less on the point of kicking the bucket. I immediately wrote to Baron Izzy.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br><i>Salut.</i>
<br>Your
<br>K. M.

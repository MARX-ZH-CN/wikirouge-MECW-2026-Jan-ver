ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester,] Wednesday, [27 April 1853]</p>
<p>Dear Marx,</p>
<p>If there is nothing better you can do about the bill, send it to me by return (in time for Friday's American post). I think I can get it cashed for you by a Yankee or at any rate advance you £10 against it pending receipt of the balance—i.e., you can't have the money before 1 May, but on <i>2</i> <i>May</i> you will receive the £10 <i>without</i> <i>fail'<b>.</b></i><b> Write and tell me whether in these circumstances you will be able to come here, and do come if at all possible; then you can send the money to your wife yourself.</b></p>
<p>At any rate, keep me informed, so that I'm NOT OUT OF THE WAY when you arrive.</p>
<p>P. Ermen's old library will again be at our disposal.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E
</p>

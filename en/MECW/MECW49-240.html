ENGELS TO HERMANN ENGELS</p>
<p>IN BARMEN</p>
<p>London, 12 July 1892</p>
<p>Dear Hermann,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your letter of 23 June. The Schaafhausen dividend has been debited to you—many thanks.<sup>b</sup> I hope you enjoy your Italian trip; I shall probably go there myself some time.</p>
<p>Today I am just writing to ask which of you is going to be in Engelskirchen on or about the 10th or 12th August, and whether you could do with me there for a couple of days round about that time. I shall probably be paying another visit to the Continent then and, although unlikely to take in Barmen, should like for once to get another breath of Engelskirchen air. I'd be glad if you wouldn't mention this unless you have to or else certain people might expect me to go to Barmen as well, and that might not fit in with my other plans.</p>
<p>For the rest, all is well with me but I too am beginning to feel the need for relaxation. That's the trouble with London; in July it becomes sultry and unbearable and one longs to get right away from it. But I still have heaps of urgent jobs to do.</p>
<p>Love to Emma<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and your children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Friedrich

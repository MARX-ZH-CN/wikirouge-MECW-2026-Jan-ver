MARX TO MAX OPPENHEIM</p>
<p>IN PRAGUE</p>
<p>[Karlsbad,] 6 September 1876</p>
<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>Your sister's letter enclosed; her news of the <i>aventures de Norderney</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>was of the very greatest interest to my daughter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>and myself. I have seen your sister's portrait and heard many complimentary things about her in Hanover, and had hoped to make her acquaintance at your home in Prague; however, I see from your letter that she is still staying in Aachen.</p>
<p>My cure ends on Sunday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>Monday is therefore the day appointed for our departure for Prague<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>; nevertheless, it's possible that our stay at Karlsbad will have to be prolonged. My daughter has suddenly become unwell. I hope it's nothing serious; I'm expecting a second visit from the doctor this evening. You shall have further information as soon as I can communicate something more definite.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

Having completed it, he spent a few days with Max Oppenheim in Prague, and then, after brief visits to Kreuznach and Liège, returned to London on 22 September 1876.</span>

<br><i>To Ludwig Feuerbach in Bruckberg</i>
<br>Dear Sir,
<br>A few months ago while passing through [Bruckberg], Dr. Ruge informed you of our plan to publish Franco-German <em>Jahrbücher</em> and asked at the same time for your collaboration. It has now been already settled that <em>Paris</em> is to be the place for printing and publication and that the first monthly number is to appear by the end of November.
<br>Before I leave for Paris in a few days time I feel obliged to make a brief <em>epistolary</em> approach to you since I have not had the privilege of making your personal acquaintance.
<br>You were one of the first writers who expressed the need for a Franco-German scientific alliance. You will, therefore, assuredly be one of the first to support an enterprise aimed at bringing such an alliance into being. For German and French articles are to be published <em>promiscue</em> in the <em>Jahrbücher</em>. The best Paris writers have agreed to cooperate. Any contribution from you will be most welcome and there is probably something at your disposal that you have already written.
<br>From your preface to the 2nd edition of <em>Das Wesen des Christenthums</em>, I am almost led to conclude that you are engaged on a fuller work on <em>Schelling</em> or that you have something about this windbag in mind. Now that would be a marvellous beginning.
<br>Schelling, as you know, is the 38th member of the [German] Confederation. The entire German police is at his disposal as I myself once experienced when I was editor of the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em>. That is, a censorship order can prevent anything against the holy Schelling [...indecipherable word here...] from getting through. Hence it is almost impossible in Germany to attack Schelling except in books of over 21 sheets, and books of over 21 sheets are not books read by the people. <em>Kapp's</em> book <em>is</em> very commendable but it is too circumstantial and rather inaptly separates judgment from facts. Moreover, our governments have found a means of making such works ineffective. They must not be mentioned. They are ignored or the few official reviews dismiss them with a few contemptuous words. The great Schelling himself pretends he knows nothing about these attacks and he succeeded in diverting attention from Kapp's book by making a tremendous <em>fiscal</em> to-do about old Paulus' soup. That was a diplomatic master stroke.
<br>But just imagine Schelling exposed in Paris, before the French literary world! His vanity will not be able to restrain itself, this will wound the Prussian Government to the quick, it will be an attack on Schelling's sovereignty abroad, and a <em>vain</em> monarch sets much greater store by his <em>sovereignty abroad</em> than at home.
<br>How cunningly Herr von Schelling enticed the French, first of all the weak, eclectic <em>Cousin</em>, then even the gifted Leroux. For Pierre Leroux and his like still regard Schelling as the man who replaced transcendental idealism by rational realism, abstract thought by thought with flesh and blood, specialised philosophy by world philosophy! To the French romantics and mystics he cries: "I, the union of philosophy and theology," to the French materialists: "I, the union of flesh and idea," to the French sceptics: "I, the destroyer of dogmatism," in a word, "I ... Schelling!"
<br>Schelling has not only been able to unite philosophy and theology, but philosophy and diplomacy too. He has turned philosophy into a general diplomatic science, into a diplomacy for all occasions. Thus an attack on Schelling is indirectly an attack on our entire policy, and especially on Prussian policy. Schelling's philosophy is Prussian policy <em>sub specie philosophiae</em>.
<br>You would therefore be doing a great service to our enterprise, but even more to truth, if you were to contribute a characterisation of Schelling to the very first issue. You are just the man for this because you are <em>Schelling in reverse</em>. The <em>sincere thought –</em> we may believe the best of our opponent – of the <em>young</em> Schelling for the realisation of which however he did not possess the necessary qualities except imagination, he had no energy but vanity, no driving force but opium, no organ but the irritability of a feminine perceptivity, this sincere thought of his youth, which in his case remained a fantastic youthful dream, has become truth, reality manly seriousness in your case. Schelling is therefore an <em>anticipated caricature</em> of you, and as soon as reality confronts the caricature the latter must dissolve into thin air. I therefore regard you as the necessary, natural – that is, nominated by Their Majesties Nature and History – opponent of Schelling. Your struggle with him is the struggle of the imagination of philosophy with philosophy itself.
<br>I confidently expect a contribution from you in the form you may find most convenient. My address is: "Herr Mäurer. Rue Vanneau No. 23, Paris, for the attention of Dr. Marx." Although she does not know you, my wife sends greetings. You would not believe how many followers you have among the fair sex.
<br>Yours very truly,
<br><em>Dr. Marx</em>

ENGELS TO EDWARD PEASE</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London,] 27 January 1886</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>In answer to your kind note of yesterday I regret to say that my time is so entirely taken up by urgent work on hand, that I cannot possibly for at least a year to come undertake any fresh engagements whatever.</p>
<p>Having said this much, I need not enter upon other considerations which might stand in the way of my writing the article you desire. But I may state at all events that the party to which I belong, has no fixed ready-made proposals to submit. Our views as to the points of difference between a future, non-capitalistic society and that of to-day, are strict conclusions from existing historical facts and developments, and of no value—theoretical or practical — unless presented in connection with these facts and developments. The economical aspect of these points of difference I have tried to establish and to explain in my book <i>Herrn E.D. Umwälzung der Wissenschaft</i> 2nd ed. p. 253 to 271; reprinted in my pamphlet <i>Die Entwicklung des Sozialismus etc.</i> 3rd ed. p. 28-48.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>Shorter I cannot possibly do even this partial abstract, where neither political nor non-economic social questions are even touched. To give you a résumé in 600 words is therefore a task utterly beyond my powers.</p>
<p>I am yours faithfully

<p>ENGELS TO MRS KARPELES</p>
<p>IN VIENNA</p>
<p>[London,] 30 November 1894<br>
41 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Madam,</p>
<p>May I tender my warmest thanks for the delightful present you were so kind as to send me for my birthday? I value it all the more highly, not only for being your own handiwork, but also and above all for your having found leisure to do it at a time when you already had enough and more than enough to do for the little one that is on its way. For during that self-same time I was again afforded an opportunity of seeing, here in my own house, what a multitude of cares and preoccupations the expectation of motherhood involves.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I have all the more reason to pride myself in a present made for me at such a time.</p>
<p>I put it to use at once, on my birthday, when I took a short siesta. One sleeps upon it as sweetly as the proverbial 'quiet conscience' upon a 'good pillow'. In fact I feel pretty sure that it would be able to cope without dif- ficulty even with a pretty uneasy conscience.</p>
<p>I was glad to hear from Ludwig that you and your little one are still keeping well and trust that you will continue to do so.</p>
<p>Again, many thanks and kindest regards to you and to Dr Karpeles from</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>F. Engels

<div class="Publication">Written at the end of 1840 and the beginning of 1841 <br>First published in the book: Michael Knieriem, Friedrich Engels: Cola di Rienzi. Ein unbekannter dramatischer Entwurf, Trier, 1974<br>Published in English for the first time in Marx-Engels Collected Works, Volume 3</div>

<br>Note from MECW :

<blockquote>
<br>This draft of the young Engels' verse drama Cola di Rienzi only became known after Volume 2, containing his early works, letters and literary experiments, had already gone to press. This draft is therefore being published in the present volume as a supplement, although chronologically it belongs to Volume 2.
<br>The draft manuscript was discovered among the posthumous papers of the German poet Adolf Schults, a native of Elberfeld, by Michael Knieriem, director of Frederick Engels House in Wuppertal. Schults belonged to a group of Wuppertal writers and art-lovers which included many of Engels' fellow pupils from the Elberfeld high school who kept in touch with him during his residence (from July 1838 to March 1841) ;n Bremen, where he was gaining practical experience with a commercial firm and was also engaged in literary activities. Knieriem arranged the first publication of this drama in co-operation with Hans Pelger, director of Karl Marx House in Trier (see Michael Knieriem, Friedrich Engels: Cola di Rienzi. Ein unbehannter dramatischer Entwurf. Herausgegeben vom Friedrich-Engels-Haus, Wuppertal, und Karl-Marx-Haus, Trier, Trier, 1974). The draft was evidently intended for an opera libretto, as may be gathered from a letter of September 30, 1840, sent by Engels' schoolfriend Carl de Haas to Schults and other Elberfeld writers in which there is a reference to Engels' intention of writing the text of an opera at the request of one of his Elberfeld friends. This is also borne out by the style of the work, parts of which are specially adapted for performance (ducts, trios, and settings for chorus), and in which provision is made for the insertion of musical episodes. The draft was in all probability written between the end of 1840 and the beginning of 1841, since one page of the manuscript bears a short passage in Hebrew from the Old Testament which was also quoted in a letter of February 22, 184 1, from Engels to Friedrich Graeber (see MECW, Vol. 2, p. 526).
<br>Engels took the plot for his drama from events in Rome in the middle of the 14th century — the struggle which developed between the feudal aristocracy on the one hand and the merchant and artisan population on the other. In May 1347, as a result of a popular uprising, a republic was proclaimed in Rome with "people's tribune" Cola di Rienzi at its head. With Rienzi, firm measures against the nobility and a desire to affirm the principle of popular sovereignty and achieve the unification of Italy were combined with fantastic notions about the restoration of ancient Rome's grandeur and world domination. Banished from Rome at the end of 1347 as a result of intrigues by the feudal magnates, Rienzi was reinstated in August 1354 with the aid of mercenary troops commanded by foreign condottieri. The people rose against Rienzi, however, resenting his despotic behaviour, his ambitiousness, and the increased tax burden, a measure which was forced on him by the costs of paying the mercenaries and conducting the war with the aristocrats. On October 8, 1354, an insurrection flared up against him and he was killed. The action in Engels' drama deals with the second period of Rienzi's rule.
<br>The manuscript is a rough draft. In several places, there are author's corrections, erasures and additions in the margin. On one page, the initials "F. E." and Engels' signature are to be seen in the margin. Some drawings made by the author on several pages refer to the plot of the drama, while others are unconnected with it (there are also some cartoons). The last pages contain a variant of the beginning of Act One, Scene One (in the present edition, this has been printed after the corresponding first version and has been separated from it, as from the continuation, by a horizontal line).

<br><b>ORSINI</b>

</center><br>Come, Colonna, let us hurry,
For the mob approaches, see!<center>
<br><b>COLONNA</b>

</center><br>I shall stand and face their fury. Never was I known to flee!<center>

<br><b>ORLANDO</b>

</center><br>We must go, or else I fear
We shall not escape their anger.<center>

<br>One day we shall return,
<br>
Then tremble before our wrath!<center>
<br><b>PEOPLE</b>

</center><br>Down with you!
(Exeunt Colonna and Patricians. The people gradually divide into two choruses, the first of which is bigger than the second.)<center>
<br><b>BATTISTA</b>

</center><br>See, they quail, those noble lords, Cowering back with unsheathed swords, Count and Baron, Marquis and Prince, Needs must hastily hie them hence! But what use, if ten small devils Leave us, and the worst of evils— Yes, the Prince of Hell, none other— Comes and takes the whole place over? Granted those ones are a curse, Still the Tribune plagues us worse!<center>
<br><b>FIRST CHORUS</b>

</center><br>Hail to the Tribune, the people's liberator! Who dares to revile him?<center>
<br><b>SECOND CHORUS</b>

</center><br>Down with him!<center>
<br><b>BATTISTA</b>

</center><br>He is as evil and as good
<br>As yonder lords of noble blood.
<br>He ever speaks words passing fair, Yet to the people shuts his ear. Tyrants out, a despot in—
<br>
'Twill end as it did first begin.<center>
<br><b>FIRST CHORUS</b>

</center><br>Silence, slanderer!<center>
<br><b>SECOND CHORUS</b>

</center><br>No, say on!<center>

As yonder lords of noble blood.<center>

<br><b>BATTISTA</b>

</center><br>To you he speaks, etc.
<br>Tyrants out, etc.
<br>
(Confusion. The music of a triumphal procession is heard in the distance. Cannon-fire. All are startled.)<center>
<br><b>BOTH CHORUSES</b>

</center><br>He comes! Let us meet him!<center>
<br><b>FIRST CHORUS</b>

</center><br>Hail to the liberator.
Cola di Rienzi<center>
<br><b>SECOND CHORUS</b>

</center><br>He'll fall to our revenge
<br>Soon, as did those others,
<br>
However firm he stands.<center>
<br><b>BOTH CHORUSES</b>

</center><br>To meet him!<center>
<br>(Exeunt omnes.)

</center><center>
<br><br>
<b>Scene Two</b>
<br><b>Colonna's palace, Camilla's chamber.</b>

</br></center><center>
<br><b>CAMILLA</b>

</center><br>Why that turmoil? What's the meaning Of that roaring mob out there;
<br>All that raving, running, screaming, Bloody flags waved in the air?
<br>And I hear a wild throng gathered At the palace steps: they're crying Out the name of my own father, Threatening and vilifying.
<br>Will you escape, father, safe and sound From the crazed people that riot and swarm? Will Holy Mary, Protectress, look down Like a good star and preserve you from harm? Fear is upon me, black and ineffable, Father, all for your sake!
<br>Spare me this suffering, dreadful, unbearable, Father, oh please come back!
<br>All the servants, in their terror, Leaving me, have run away,
<br>And I stand here white with horror In the palace on my own.
<br>
But—Oh God! for here comes Walter— Heart, O heart, be still, I pray! — Now he sees me quail and falter, Through the gates he runs alone!<center>
<br>Enter Montreal.

</center><center>
<br><b>CAMILLA</b>

</center><br>By all the Saints in Heaven, Montreal, you dare— <center>
<br><b>MONTREAL (going down on his knees)</b>

</center><br>O Camilla! My Camilla!<center>
<br><b>CAMILLA</b>

</center><br>You dare set foot inside this house Denied to you forever by my father? Let him but meet you here, and from his sword Your life's in danger!<center>
<br><b>MONTREAL</b>

</center><br>Sweet lady, do you mind no more The love that bound us lastingly, The vows that by the stars we swore, The tears you used to shed for me?<center>
<br><b>CAMILLA</b>

</center><br>Leave me! O Saints, my poor heart Is bursting in my breast!<center>
<br><b>MONTREAL</b>

</center><br>Beloved, see the hectic fever
That drives the blood into my face. Am I now strange to you forever Who on your breast once found my peace?<center>
<br><b>CAMILLA</b>

</center><br>I must not look you in the eye, Being beholden to forswear you.
My wretched heart will break, but I, Alas, I must not dare come near you.<center>
<br><b>MONTREAL</b>

</center><br>O see me begging at your feet,
<br>My only dearest love are you!
<br>
But lock your heart against me, sweet, And Heaven locks its portals too! <center>
<br><b>CAMILLA</b>

</center><br>My breast is heaving up and down, From him I cannot stay apart.
Once more in true love's toils I'm bound. Walter—forever yours my heart!<center>
<br><b>BOTH</b>

</center><br>O true love's blessed victory!
<br>No matter what else may conspire Against us, what can mar our sky When each belongs to each entire? Though we be shunned the whole world over, Our bond disparaged as a bane,
<br>
If we do not desert each other, Indeed our star can never wane!<center>
<br><b>CAMILLA</b>

</center><br>But tell me, Walter, what arouses The mob on the streets to such violent rage? And, above all, my father, my father— Where is he?<center>
<br><b>MONTREAL</b>

</center><br>Fear not! Your father is in safety, Debating flight with the city nobles In the Orsinis' palace.
<br>The Tribune approached; rejoicing, the people All went to meet him. Like lightning he moved, And, ere the nobles could guess what was happening, He stood at the gates of the city. Your father will soon be here with his trusted friends, To lead you from here to a place of safety. But look! his suite comes over there, With trumpets sounding, banners waving! Yes, I can see his silver hair!
<br>
He comes, and so I must be leaving.<center>
<br><b>CAMILLA</b>

</center><br>My Walter, go away from me,
But for my love you need not fear. 1 shall yearn for you constantly, My heart shall ever hold you dear! <center>
<br><b>WALTER</b>

</center><br>My joy—until we meet again!
The Saints be with you—I will come Back to you, love, a nobler man, To carry you, my Princess, home! Great things to do some day I mean. My life on it: the time will come, I'll raise you to the throne as queen And you shall reign with me in Rome.<center>
<br><b>CAMILLA</b>

</center><br>My loving heart content would be If I were simply your poor wife. It were the height of bliss for me To serve you, body and soul, for life!<center>
<br><b>BOTH</b>

</center><br>O true love's blessed victory! etc.<center>
<br><br>
<br><b>Scene Three</b>
<br><b>The people swarm onto the stage and range themselves in the background, while Battista [stands] in front with the chorus of malcontents. Triumphal procession.</b>
<br><br>
<br><b>CHORUS OF PEOPLE</b>

</br></br></center><br>Hail to the Tribune, the people's liberator! Hail to Rienzi, Father of the Fatherland! The procession grows.<center>
<br><b>BATTISTA</b>

</center><br>With mercenaries he moves in,
<br>The people's freedom claims to win! He's scared of his own countrymen. This joke will soon come to an end! 

<center>
<br><b>Chorus as above. BATTISTA</b>

</center><br>They fill the air with joyful cries. Suffering soon will make them wise!
Cola di Rienzi<center>
<br><b>CHORUS OF MALCONTENTS</b>

</center><br>Down with the foreign mercenaries! Down with the Tribune!
Curse you, the people's oppressor, Curse you, desecrator of holy places! Away with the foreigners, away!<center>
<br><b>CHORUS OF PEOPLE</b>

</center><br>Hail to the Tribune on high!
Long live the Father of the Fatherland!<center>
<br><b>BATTISTA</b>

</center><br>See, he looks arrogant enough,
<br>Now that his clever trick's come off. See how defiant he goes there,
<br>
Now that he's caught us in his snare. He will not long remain so proud When common sense dawns on the crowd. Chorus of people as above.<center>
<br><b>RIENZI (on the rostrum)</b>

</center><br>So stand I once again amongst you, 0 noble Romans! Again I see
<br>All Rome's holy places—the Capitol, The eternal Forum! You are welcoming me, And so my gratitude shall not be wanting. 1 swear before God's countenance To consecrate my whole life to your freedom, That Ancient Rome shall rise again As great and free as ever from her ruins! I shall not rest, nor tarry,
<br>Till Rome in all her ancient splendour, And in her ancient majesty,
<br>Shines before all the peoples of this Earth! Even as the phoenix, prouder, more magnificent, Soars up aloft from its own funeral pyre, So may the bygone age of world conquest Return once more, new and imperishable!

<br><br>
<b>ACT TWO</b>
<br><b>Scene One</b>
<br>Palestrina. A chamber in Colonna's house. At the beginning, shots are heard from time to time.
<br>Colonna, Camilla.

</br></center><center>
<br><b>CAMILLA</b>

</center><br>Father, for Jesus' sake, what is afoot? With anxious faces your friends are leaving, Deserting you; the besiegers' cannon Are thundering closer and fiercer than ever— Are we then lost, my father, oh tell me!<center>
<br><b>COLONNA</b>

</center><br>Camilla, be calm and listen.
<br>The ambitious Orsini wanted
<br>No more to obey me, the chosen leader, But stand beside me, give orders like me! I stuck to my rights;
<br>The rift between us was irremediably wide. His son stepped forward. Fathers, said he, Be not divided in danger's hour, When unity is our foremost need.
<br>I want to reunite you!
<br>Give me, Colonna, your daughter in marriage. Long have I loved her, the fair Camilla. If, through your children, you are united By holy bonds,
<br>Strife no longer shall split you asunder Over the power in the land.
<br>Then his father spoke up as follows: So be it! But if you refuse, Colonna, Tomorrow I shall withdraw my troops And come to terms with the Tribune. Then try and hold the fortress alone! Those were his words. And so, my daughter, Even before the sun goes down You'll go—as I told him — to young Orsini And join him in wedlock. So make you ready.
<br>
Cola di Rienzi<center>
<br><b>CAMILLA</b>

</center><br>Oh God, what shall I do?<center>
<br><b>COLONNA</b>

</center><br>You seem unwilling to give in.
I'd long intended that you should win A better thing on your brow to set Than Count Orsini's coronet. Whoever might your hand in marriage merit At least a princedom should inherit— Or so I thought. Things worked out differently. What choice have we?<center>
<br><b>CAMILLA</b>

</center><br>So it is settled, then:
<br>I'll be the sacrifice.
<br>For peace between you men,
<br>My own peace I must lose.
<br>Am I so much alone
<br>That he I most despise
<br>Must be my husband—one
<br>I would not freely choose?
<br>Father, I beg you, spare me your fury!
<br>Just for you, I
<br>Would gladly die,
<br>
But Count Orsini I never shall marry!<center>
<br><b>COLONNA</b>

</center><br>What evil spirit has made you so wild?
<br>You even choose
<br>My wish to refuse?
<br>
I, I command you, iniquitous child!<center>
<br><b>CAMILLA</b>

</center><br>Command of me whatever you will, But the vow that I swore
<br>To the man I adore,
<br>
I honour it still!<center>
<br><b>COLONNA</b>

</center><br>To Montreal I'm to give you away? I thought the hope of his winning your hand 
<br>Had long, long since been gone from your mind. A fine son-in-law for me, I must say! Since when have plunderers, Robbers and murderers
<br>
Won the Colonnas' womenfolk, pray?<center>
<br><b>CAMILLA</b>

</center><br>Ere I should prove
<br>False to my vow,
<br>Let the Earth now
<br>Swallow me up, or the blackness of night.

<br>Nothing can blight,
<br>True ones in woe
<br>
Live to the day when their darkness turns bright!<center>
<br><b>COLONNA</b>

</center><br>Can you not see the threat that surrounds us?
<br>Iron balls
<br>Pound down the walls,
<br>The enemy stranglehold tightens around us. Think of what's going to happen to you At the dread hour
<br>When turret and tower
<br>
Fall, and foeman comes swarming through. Who will protect you and save you from force When the wild soldiers clutch you with their claws?<center>
<br><b>CAMILLA</b>

</center><br>My Walter will shield me, he surely will come! If he comes not, a dagger will save me From shame!<center>
<br><b>COLONNA</b>

</center><br>Did not this Montreal of yours First put us in this sorry plight, Sending the Tribune his own force To harass us by day and night?
<br>Yet this same Montreal
<br>
You'd choose before them all?<center>
<br><b>CAMILLA</b>

</center><br>I shall stay true to him forever! <center>

(Exit servant. Enter Montreal in cloak and hat. He doffs his and flings back his cloak.)<center>

</center><br>Oh Heavens! Walter!<center>
<br><b>COLONNA</b>

</center><br>Montreal! You dare to enter my house, You, whose soldiers besiege us now, You, that have taken the enemy's side, You, that have stolen my daughter's heart From me? What is your purpose here?<center>
<br><b>MONTREAL</b>

</center><br>Softly, dear sir, and listen to me! Do you remember, you turned me away When I was seeking Camilla's hand? 
Now I revenge myself, as befits a knight. My soldiers have you completely surrounded, Their guns rock Palestrina's towers. A sign from me, and the whole wild horde streams in, And then you are lost. For who will save you? Well, I will save you, if you so wish! Palestrina need not fall, and I shall lead you In pomp and ceremony back to Rome!<center>
<br><b>COLONNA</b>

</center><br>So you would treacherously leave the Tribune? That is hardly a knightly deed— I'll have no part in it at all.<center>
<br><b>MONTREAL</b>

</center><br>What treachery's here? My brothers, not I, Sent the troops to join the Tribune. I never sanctioned the deed at all. Who's to prevent me withdrawing my soldiers? That I'll do. This only I ask: Give me what I could anyway win for myself!<center>
<br><b>COLONNA</b>

</center><br>What do you want of me?<center>
<br><b>MONTREAL</b>

</center><br>In Romagna, in the March of Ancona Are thousands obedient to my word. I have no land, and yet I am
<br>The most powerful man in Italy.
<br>I come to you, and I demand:
<br>
Agree to let me assume the title Of Roman Podestà and take your daughter As wife beside me on the Throne! (Colonna paces up and down in thought.)<center>
<br><b>CAMILLA</b>

</center><br>Did I not say he'd rescue us, Hearing that I was in distress? Did I not know he'd think of me
In times of danger or of stress?<center>
<br><b>MONTREAL</b>

</center><br>How could I ever desert my beloved Or my beloved's father in need?<center>
<br><b>COLONNA</b>

</center><br>So be it! I'll sacrifice Qrsini. He always envied me, being vain. He and his house may fall, but I shall rise My son, here is my daughterl She's yours! Be Podestà of Rome with her beside you! Camilla, past returning
<br>Are hate and enmity.
<br>
I have appeased your yearning, Look up, look up at me!<center>
<br><b>CAMILLA</b>

</center><br>Flowers of love's joy so tender From harsh adversity
Have blossomed in their splendour— O wondrous Destiny!<center>
<br><b>MONTREAL</b>

</center><br>And now what do we care
<br>That once we burned so long, Wrestling with despair,
<br>
And grief, and pain, and wrong!<center>
<br><b>CAMILLA</b>

</center><br>O day of joy for lovers!<center>
<br><b>MONTREAL</b>

</center><br>O gift of love so true!<center>
<br><b>CAMILLA</b>

</center><br>O bliss when suffering's over!<center>

</center><br>Now take you each the other,

Cola di Rienzi<center>
<br><b>ALL THREE</b>

</center><br>We'll go unhesitating
<br>To meet our destiny,
<br>The Future contemplating
<br>Serene, and gay, and free,
<br>Through harsh pain sanctified, After long strife together—
<br>Love's flames thus purified
<br>
Shall burn and burn forever!<center>

</br></br></center><br>Curse the traitorsl For turning the people Away from me, for reviling me.
<br>As if I'd fatten myself on the poor! Curse them! If only the people stay loyal, The future shall see me gloriously vindicated. My people all, for whom I've gladly Been cursed, reviled, imprisoned, banned, For whom I've braved the Tyrants, loudly Crying amongst them: Hold your hand! My people, you will not go under Shamed and abused, like cowards base; You shall arise in all your grandeur, A proud and a victorious race!
<br>You know not the many trials, Cares and anguish I went through; You know not the many perils
<br>That I faced because of you!
<br>Long years, hesitating never, Through the thorns I struggled on, Yet you may not thank me ever
<br>For the good that I have done!
<br>But no! I wanted Rome to free
<br>That fell, a victim to dissension. Restore her ancient dignity—
<br>Is that no fine and great intention?
<br>
O Ancient Rome, do but once show Yourself to me in your past might, And I have lived enough, can go Happy into the grave's dark night!<center>
<br><b>NINA (entering)</b>

</center><br>Oh Cola, tell me, is it true
<br>That foes are plotting against you? Is danger hanging over
<br>
The head so dear to me?<center>
<br><b>RIENZI</b>

</center><br>Calm yourself, my dearest wife.
A few power-seeking, envious ones, And Walter von Montreal, that traitor, Are stirring up the people against me, Hoping to bring about my downfall. Helped by God and a loyal people, 1 shall outwit the treacherous ones. Before they even sense the danger, Their heads will roll for their own crimes. How could these schemes of theirs unnerve me? Are they as strong as I am here, With my true-loving wife to serve me, And with my senses calm and clear?<center>
<br><b>NINA</b>

</center><br>Cola, why can't I put to flight The fears with which I am consumed? In dreams I've seen your face all white Since you the purple robe assumed.<center>
<br><b>RIENZI</b>

</center><br>My dearest wife, come, fear no more! We are not in the slightest danger; Untroubled can the eagle soar Clear of the snakes that hiss with anger.<center>
<br><b>NINA</b>

</center><br>I cannot think what I would do,
<br>If I should lose you, love, one day.
<br>Cola di Rienzi
<br>Whoever left me without you,
<br>
Would steal my very life away.<center>
<br><b>COLA</b>

</center><br>Oh, put aside all fear and care, For what inspires me is sublime.
<br>I can't go under—do not dare— Until I have achieved my aim, Until Rome's might triumphantly
<br>Is born again, and Freedom shakes The dust off, and the world can see In trembling how the lion wakes. If, in the heat of battle, I stood Alone, in peril of my life, Deserted and abandoned, would
<br>
You not stay by me, dearest wife?<center>
<br><b>NINA</b>

</center><br>Dearest, as some God may decree, So let it be, then, for us two.
<br>I cannot, and I will not, flee,
<br>
In need and death I'll stand by you!<center>
<br><b>BOTH</b>

</center><br>Firmly together, on our own,
We shall face treachery and lies. Though in this world we stood alone, Our true love ever would suffice!<center>

<br><b>NINA (hastening in, breathless)</b>

</center><br>Help, Holy Mary!
<br>Help, Father in Heaven!
<br>Oh, what a rabble
<br>Comes down the streets tearing, Roaring, rampaging,
<br>Many-voiced, raging;
<br>They're bursting through breaches And soon they will reach us.
<br>Our palace they're nearing!
<br>In wild agitation
<br>They threaten destruction
<br>And grim devastation;
<br>In savage eruption
<br>The rabble draws nigh!
<br>Our deliverance please send,
<br>Ye most blessed ones on high;
<br>Let the angels' wings extend
<br>Over us protectingly.
<br>Hear, oh hear my anguished plea, Come to us, shield us from danger. Please, oh please let us not be Victims of the mob's blind anger!
<br>Nearer and nearer
<br>The rabble is teeming,
<br>Higher and higher
<br>The flood is streaming.
<br>Swords are glittering, Spear-points flickering,
<br>Flashing bright!
<br>Ever nearer and more mighty,
<br>Death enfolds us with his arm. Help, O Mary! Help, Almighty!
<br>
Do not let us come to harm!<center>
<br><b>RIENZI (entering)</b>

</center><br>It's happened — something I never feared! The maddened people have risen against me, Howling vengeance for Montreal's death And for Battista's too.<center>
<br><b>NINA</b>

</center><br>O dearest Cola!
Danger is pressing nearer and nearer, 0 save us both!<center>
<br><b>RIENZI</b>

</center><br>Keep calm, beloved wife!
<br>Danger is not so very near.
<br>Still in the flush of youth am I, And with a face unyielding, proud, 1 shall go out there to defy
<br>The fury of the crowd!
<br>My eye is swift as lightning blast, My brow unmarred by life's abuse, Like swords, my words are keen and fast— So let all Hell break loose!
<br>
Let Hell break loose—still I shall brave it. I raised myself up to the throne, Now I must stand my ground and save it. I'll calm their anger down!<center>
<br><b>NINA</b>

</center><br>Oh, let us yield, I humbly pray, Let us seek refuge from their fury. Cola, just once, hear what I say, O Cola, let us hurry!<center>

</center><br>In cowardice? Not while I draw breath!<center>

</center><br>I'll stand and face it out with death, Though he press in from every side!<center>
<br><b>NINA</b>

</center><br>Oh, come! The mob does not deserve So great a sacrifice—oh, no!<center>
<br><b>RIENZI</b>

</center><br>If ruin strikes, my death shall serve Before the whole wide world to show I did not shrink to dedicate
My life that Rome once more be great.<center>
<br><b>NINA</b>

</center><br>So, husband, you'll not run away? Then from your side I shall not go, As in good times, likewise in woe And wretched fortune, I shall stay.<center>
<br><b>RIENZI</b>

</center><br>Come to my breast, O marvellous wife! The reward of striving constantly Blooms in your love, God's joy, for me, Though reached I not my goal in life!<center>
<br><b>NINA</b>

</center><br>So big, so strong you are, my mate! Held in your warm embrace, to fall With you, most wonderful of all— Oh what a high and blissful fate!<center>
<br><b>COLA, NINA</b>

</center><br>And so we go forth joyously, Embracing one another tight, Bathed in the glow of true love's light, To meet whate'er our fate may be! Though death outside await us twain, Through fire and sword, both unaffrighted We go, together and united,
<br>To face what Fortune may ordain!

<br>The hour of revenge
<br>For my sorrow and anguish. The hour of revenge!
<br>His blood shall be shed
<br>In atonement for yours,
<br>My murdered, my dear one, Though I strike him dead
<br>With this, my own hand.
<br>True love has been murdered, Burn hatred, burn more,
<br>And stain, blood of tyrants, My thirsting sword-blade
<br>With purple-red gore.
<br>Not woman, but Fury Henceforth be my name;
<br>With steel I shall sever
<br>The veins of that same
<br>Vile traitor who sent
<br>My love to his grave!
<br>Away with compassion
<br>And womanly weakness! Vengeance, ay, vengeance
<br>For that shameful crime
<br>Is all that I crave!
<br>The crowds are all swarming And gathering together,
<br>More frenzied than ever
<br>I'm going to make them.
<br>Fall, then, Rienzi,
<br>From the throne to your doom— Your victim, my lover,
<br>Awaits you in the tomb!
<br>(To the people, who have gathered round her.) Vengeance I cry! Vengeance I cry! For the tyrant's execution, Cola di Rienzi

Let me restore our ancient glory And you'll be lords of the Earth And free, with laws of your own making. Listen not to the voice of slander, Judge me by deeds alone!<center>

<p><i>Cologne,</i> November 5. <i>Letters and newspapers from Vienna failed to arrive</i>. The newspapers from <i>Breslau</i> which we have received, the <i>Allgemeine Oderzeitung</i>, the <i>Schlesische Zeitung</i> and the <i>Breslauer Zeitung</i>, contain, properly speaking, nothing.</p>
<p>Several <i>Berlin</i> morning papers of November 3 carry the following news item, one newspaper having received it from <i>Hietzing</i>, the others from <i>Vienna</i>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>The city of Vienna is entirely occupied by imperial troops</i>."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i> prints this report, which it received from Breslau [Kölnische Zeitung, Nov 5] and which "<i>is described as reliable</i>", and it confirms this report by a "telegram" from Berlin, which "in itself" is of course reliable.</p>
<p>Let us leave aside the anonymous note from Breslau and proceed to the <i>telegram</i> printed in big letters in the <i>Kölnische Zeitung.</i> [Kölnische Zeitung, Nov 5]</p>
<p>The telegram was dispatched from Vienna at noon on November 1.</p>
<p>The letter to Dumont, if he received the news in writing, was sent at <i>8 a.m.</i> on November 3, with the Berlin mail.</p>
<p>On the <i>evening</i> of November 3, this news was circulating merely as a rumour throughout Berlin, and the newspapers of November 4 published on the evening of November 3 <i>deny it.</i></p>
<p><i>Hence we have no news from Vienna</i>. Dumont, who reported the burning and capture of Vienna since October 6, could by way of exception have got hold of the right fact on one day in the month.

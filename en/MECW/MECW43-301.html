MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 10 March<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>1870</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>Since I know this stuff amuses you, the following with all haste (post just closing): in addition to a few introductory marginal notes on Gladstone's latest declaration in the House of Commons about the PRISONERS, Jennychen sent the <i>Marseillaise</i> an extract from an older letter by O'Donovan Rossa, published in <i>The Irishman</i> on 5 February (I believe that was the date). The <i>Marseillaise</i> (in a truly French way it gives this letter as from 'Newgate') proceeds to publish this in a special issue on Tuesday evening, containing only articles by <b>prisonniers politiques</b> and costing 50 centimes.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>This has now been reprinted (re-translation into English) this evening in <i>The Echo,</i> etc. Levy's <i>Telegraph</i> also refers to it in its Paris correspondence. <i>The Irishman</i> may well complain that it is not quoted as the source. But Jennychen will use this to demonstrate <i>how</i> the English press suppresses the <i>FACTS</i> published in the Irish press, and only publishes them as such when they come from Paris in some extraordinary manner. The English press will soon note that the idyllic days of systematic lying and hushing up the FACTS are over.</p>
<p><i>Pays</i> remarks that the increase in the price of the <i>Marseillaise</i> to 50 c. is against all the rules, since 'prison goods are always sold cheaper than others'.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

Among others, the newspaper featured letters from Rochefort, Raul Rigo, O'Donovan Rossa, and a posthumous letter from Victor Noir. The headline opening O'Donovan Rossa's letter read: 'Letter of the Citizen O'Donovan Rossa, Fenian deputy to the British Parliament, condemned to the galleys and held at the Newgate Prison'.</span>

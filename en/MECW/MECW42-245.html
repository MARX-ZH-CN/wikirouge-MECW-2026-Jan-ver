<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>On the question of the replacement-fund, full details with accompanying calculations tomorrow. You see, I must ask some other manufacturers whether our practice is the customary one or an exception. The question is whether, with an original outlay of <em>£1,000</em> on machinery, where £100 is written off in the 1st year, the rule is to write off 10% of the £1,000 in the 2nd year, or of <em>£900,</em> etc. We do the latter, and understandably the matter goes on thereby <em>in infinitum</em> at least in theory. This complicates the arithmetic considerably. But, otherwise, there is no doubt that the manufacturer is <em>using</em> the replacement-fund <em>on average</em> for 4½ years before the machinery is worn out, or at least has it at his disposal. However, this is included in the calculations, by way of what one might call a certain guarantee against moral wear and tear, or alternatively the manufacturer says: the assumption that in 10 years the machinery will be completely worn out is only approximately correct, i.e., it presupposes that I receive the money for the replacement-fund in 10 annual instalments from the outset. At all events, you shall have the calculations; regarding the economic <em>significance</em> of the matter, I am none too clear about it, I do not see how the manufacturer is supposed to be able to cheat the other partners in the surplus-value, that is, the ultimate consumers, by thus falsely representing the position — in the long run. <em>Nota bene,</em> as a rule, machinery is depreciated at 7½, which assumes a useful life of approximately 13 years.</p>
<p>Moore sends you his photograph, enclosed, and reminds you that you promised him yours, which he is very eager to have. The chapter on accumulation is quite splendid.</p>
<p>Your<br>F. E.

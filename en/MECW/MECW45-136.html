MARX TO WILHELM ALEXANDER FREUND</p>
<p>IN BRESLAU</p>
<p>London, 21 January 1877<br>
41 Maitland Park Crescent, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Friend Freund,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>My New Year's greetings to you and your dear wife are, unfortunately, belated owing to pressure of work and a sore throat which I caught during my last days in Karlsbad. My fate there was similar to that of Martin Luther's peasant who, given a leg up on one side of his horse, fell off on the other.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>My daughter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> sends her best regards to your wife and yourself. She has, <i>inter alia,</i> been guilty of a translation, published by the local Shakespeare Society of which she is a member, of Professor Delius' 'Das epische Element in Shakespeare', a translation which has, however, earned her the highest praise from Mr Delius.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> She has requested me to ask you for the name of the Swabian anti-Shakespeare professor and the title of his book about which you spoke to us in Karlsbad.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> The matador of the Shakespeare Society here, Mr Furnivall, is determined not to forego enjoyment of that opus.</p>
<p>The 'Oriental Question' (which will end up with a revolution in Russia, whatever the outcome of the war against Turkey<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> ), and the mustering of the Social-Democratic legions at home<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> will perhaps have convinced the German cultural philistine that there are more important things in the world than Richard Wagner's music of the future.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p>With kindest regards to you and your dear wife,</p>
<p>Your most sincere friend,</p>
<p>Karl Marx</p>
<p>Should you happen to see Dr Traube, would you be so good as to give him my kindest regards and remind him that he promised to send me the <i>titles</i> of his various publications. This would be of great importance to my friend Engels, who is engaged on a work on natural philosophy<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> and intends to give more weight to Traube's achievements than has hitherto been done.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> </p>

ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 29 April 1864</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>You will, presumably, at long last have rid yourself of the furunculosis. Meanwhile, Lupus has been suffering most vilely from the rheumatic headaches he was already having when you were here,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and from which he has since had no respite—on the contrary, they have got worse and worse so that he's had no proper sleep for weeks. He's already been confined to bed again on several occasions, and that sod Borchardt does nothing at all about it; he treats the touch of gout Lupus has got in his toe (but which doesn't bother him at all <i>now,</i> whereas the headaches and insomnia are really sapping his strength) with Colchicum and doesn't even give him an occasional dose of opium. Once or twice I have spoken to Lupus pretty seriously about the matter, but you know how much good that does. He believes himself to be under an obligation to B., and that's that. All the QUACK has done is to cup him of ten ounces of blood! That was the day before yesterday. This evening I shall visit Lupus again and see how things are going. Three weeks ago I too had a violent and most painful attack of rheumatism of the respiratory muscles, but Gumpert cured me of it within 24 hours.</p>
<p>The Garibaldi tomfoolery<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> came to a fitting end. The way the chap was shown the door after a week of being gaped at by the SWELLS is really too splendid and could happen nowhere but in England. It would be the ruin of anyone except Garibaldi, and even for him it's tremendously mortifying to have served the English aristocracy as a NINE DAYS' WONDER and then to have been thrown out into the street. They treated him as an out-and-out romantic. How could the fellow submit to it and how he could be so stupid as to take these Dundrearys for the English people? However, anyone who is not now convinced of the wholly bourgeois nature of this gentleman will never be convinced. For to respect the English press is almost worse than respecting the PEELERS. And as for his EXIT! Well, that beats everything.</p>
<p>But our friend Bismarck is also a <i>lumen</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Of him it might even be said: <i>n'est pas Soulouque qui veut</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> First he mimics Bonaparte's Press Laws, and now he's sending worthy Corporal William to Schleswig to induce the people to vote for annexation by Prussia! This jackass seems to imagine that the highways and byways are strewn with Savoys and Nices and that these are to be had for the taking.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> As the <i>Dagbladet</i> quite rightly points out, by the way, the Prussian reactionary press has been in such a state of exaltation since the capture of Düppel,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> and the chaps are so above themselves that one can count with certainty on the gang's coming a really bad cropper within a very short space of time.</p>
<p>I was a bit surprised by the way the Prussian army carried out the assault. The attack took place with 4 brigades (24 battalions) against 4 Danish brigades (16 battalions), i.e. by no means disproportionate superiority for an assault of this kind. Admittedly, the Danes had been greatly worn down by artillery fire but so, for that matter, had the Russians at Sevastopol, and to an even greater extent.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> However, the fact that in 20 minutes the Prussians took the first 6 field-works and then, in 2 hours—N.B. without orders, for the worthy prince<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> wanted to call it a day—the whole peninsula<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> including the bridgehead, and inflicted losses of 5,000 on approximately 13,000 Danes, is more than one might have credited the fellows with. You will, by the way, remember that I have always said Prussian fire-arms—rifles as well as guns—were the best in the world, and that has been borne out here. On the other hand, the conference will soon reveal what marionettes their diplomats are. What with Russia, Boustrapa,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> and Palmerston, aided and abetted by the 'grand' policy of Bismarck, the 'fall' that follows after pride can hardly be long in coming. But how about money? After all, the 22 millions from the public treasury and the railway loan of 6 millions must have been squandered by now, and what then?</p>
<p>I shall descend on you one of these Friday evenings but not, of course, without writing to you first.</p>
<p>Write soon, and give my regards to the FAMILY.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

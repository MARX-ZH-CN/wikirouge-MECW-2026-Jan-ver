<blockquote>
<p>The Committee of the Independent Labour Party (see Note 434) invited Engels to the May Day Socialist Carnival in a letter of April 16, 1895.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Best thanks to the Committee for its kind invitation, but as my medical adviser strongly objects just now to my accepting every engagement of any sort I am compelled to decline it. As the ticket may be useful for some one else I take the liberty of returning it herewith.

<blockquote><p>The item was printed in the column "French Republic". It deals with the Press Bill submitted to the French Constituent Assembly at the end of July 1848 and widely discussed in the German press. The Bill provided for severe punishment for insult, in the press, of the authorities, attacks on property, religion and family principles. It was passed by the Assembly on August 9-11, 1848.</p></blockquote><p>Very shortly a Bill on defamation along entirely new lines will be laid before the Chamber. Our criticism of the article of the <i>Code Napoléon</i> in connection with Hecker's suit against the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> was evidently only too well founded.'</p>

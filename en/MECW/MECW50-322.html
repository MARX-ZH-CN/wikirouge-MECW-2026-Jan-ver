ENGELS TO ARNOLD RUGE</p>
<p>IN DRESDEN</p>
<p>Berlin, 19 April 1842</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>When, during your stay in Berlin, I had the honour of making your personal acquaintance at the Wallmüller Inn, I believe to have mentioned, in the course of our conversation about Schelling, a pamphlet on him written by me,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>which was then being printed. I am taking leave to enclose a copy of this little work, just off the press, with the request of kindly contributing to its circulation by mentioning it in the <i>Jahrbücher</i> when an occasion offers itself. I need hardly say that it is calculated for a public with roughly the educational level of a student.</p>
<p>Perhaps I will take the liberty of soon sending you an article for the <i>Jahrbücher</i> which, without reference to any particular recently published work, deals with the Christian poetry of the Middle Ages, notably with its central figure, Dante. This is done in the context of the perspectives opened up by Feuerbach. Meanwhile I am sending you my regards and best wishes for the success of the <i>Jahrbücher.</i></p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>F. Oswald<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>

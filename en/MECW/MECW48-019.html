ENGELS TO HERMANN SCHLÜTERS</p>
<p>IN HOTTINGEN-ZURICH</p>
<p>[Extract]</p>
<p>London, 19 March 1887</p>
<p>It is truly fortunate that our people no longer constitute a 'faction' in the Reichstag—for the next few years, at any rate, this will be just as well.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I also like the way so many have all of a sudden come to regard 'parliamentarism' as discreditable. Irresistible, gradually accelerating growth in the number of votes—that is the main thing. Our struggle is a form of siege warfare and so long as the approach trenches keep moving forward, all will be well. We are already close to the second parallel, where we shall be able to establish our dismounting batteries and silence the enemy's guns. And, if we get as far without the besieged's gaining temporary respite from a world war, we shall then be able to estimate when it will be possible to establish breaching batteries on the crest of the glacis, make a breach with our guns and mount an assault. Until then the quiet, unhurried advance of our siege-works is the best safeguard against an overhasty assault and unnecessary casualties. The nicest touch of all is that the besieged say that <i>we</i> the besiegers, are in a state of siege!</p>
<p>Kindest regards to you all.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Engels

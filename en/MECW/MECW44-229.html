<p>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>My reply to you has been so delayed because I had kept on hoping that I would be able to send you, simultaneously with the letter, the first instalments of the <em>2nd German edition of 'Capital'</em> as well as the <em>French translation</em> (Paris). But the German and French booksellers have dragged the business out for so long that I cannot postpone it any longer.</p>
<p>First of all, my best thanks for the beautifully bound copy. The translation is <em>masterly</em>. I would be grateful if you could let me have a second, unbound, copy — for the British Museum.</p>
<p>I regret that <em>absolute</em> [lack of time] (<b>in the most strictest sense of the word</b>) prevented me from making a start on the revision for the second edition before the end of December 1871. It would have been of great benefit for the Russian edition.</p>
<p>Although the French edition — (the translation is by Mr Roy, the translator of Feuerbach) — has been prepared by a great expert in both languages, he has often translated too literally. I have therefore found myself compelled to re-write whole <b>passages</b> in French, to make them palatable to the French public. It will be all the easier later on to translate the book from French into English and the Romance languages.</p>
<p>I am so *overworked, and in fact so much interfered with in my theoretical studies, that, after September, I shall <em>withdraw</em> from the <em>commercial concern</em>, which, at this moment, weighs principally upon my own shoulders, and which, as you know, has its ramifications all over the world.* <em>Mais, est modus in rebus</em> *and I can no longer afford — for some time at least — to combine two sorts of business of so very different a character.</p>
<p>The news you have communicated to me on our <em>mutual friend</em> has delighted both myself and my family. There are few people in the world of whom I am so fond and whom I esteem so much. *</p>
<p>You will much oblige me by delivering the enclosed letter to Dr W. Baranoff at this address: 'Frau Baggohufudt-Gross, Theater Platz, Haus Baron Küster'.</p>
<p>In the hope of hearing from you soon.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,<br>A. W.</p>
<p>One of the barkers at present living in Switzerland — Mr Bakounine — is playing such strange tricks that I would be very grateful for any precise piece of information about the man — 1) as to the extent of his influence in Russia, 2) about his role in the trial of such notorious memory.

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 15 June 1857</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Are you laughing or are you weeping, Are you waking or are you sleeping?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> We here are seriously concerned about you. So write and tell us how you are. I hope you aren't being given any more hot poultices which, as a method of treatment, is <i>quite out-of-date</i> and has now more or less fallen into <i>disrepute.</i> But assuming you are using internal remedies only—as is rational and up-to-date—I fail to see why you have to keep yourself so anxiously secluded.</p>
<p>My wife very unwell. But she sounded the bugle too soon and as yet nothing has happened.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

MARX TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>[London,] 12 September 1871</p>
<p>Dear Mr Sorge,</p>
<p>Kindly convey the enclosed letter from our Irish secretary, MacDonnell, to John Devoy.</p>
<p>I had no time to reply to you in greater detail. We are so extremely busy here at the present time that I have been compelled for the past 3 months (and still am) to interrupt some very urgent theoretical work.</p>
<p>I shall merely say in regard to the Rules that the <i>English</i> EDITION is the sole authentic one.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> The conference<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> will issue authentic versions in English, French and German,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> which is also necessary because various Congress resolutions relating to the Rules must be incorporated in them.</p>
<p>The CENTRAL COMMITTEE in New York must not forget:</p>
<p>1. That the General Council had contacts in America long before the Committee was established;</p>
<p>2. That, as far as the Address<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> is concerned, it was on sale in London, and hence anybody had the right to send it to his friends in America at his own expense. The first shipment to New York was so small because the first edition was sold out in two days, which is why I did not get the number of copies allotted for my shipments.</p>
<p>3. In Par. 6 of the Rules it is expressly stated that 'NO INDEPENDENT</p>
<p>LOCAL SOCIETY SHALL BE PRECLUDED FROM DIRECTLY CORRESPONDING WITH THE GENERAL COUNCIL', and in Washington, for example, the branch declared that it did not want to enter into contact with New York.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p><i>Salut fraternel,</i></p>
<p>Karl Marx

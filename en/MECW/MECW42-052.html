ENGELS TO OTTO MEISSNER</p>
<p>IN HAMBURG</p>
<p>Manchester, 22 February 1865</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Your kind letter of 17th inst. has only just been delivered to me, since postal communication via Ostende has been interrupted for three full days, and I am greatly obliged to you for your prompt agreement to publish, and more especially for your rapid prosecution of the printing.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>I accept your fee of 2 <i>louis-d'or</i> per sheet of print and likewise leave it to you to decide the number of copies to be printed, under the condition, however, that you inform me of it in your next letter; it goes without saying [that I] am only making [over the first impression]<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> for this fee.</p>
<p>Announcements in the [newspapers shall be] attended to forthwith.</p>
<p>The apparent delay in [despatch] here, to which you justifiably allude, arose from the following: I finished on Saturday evening, 11 February, and wrote the accompanying letter late that night; the letter was taken to the post on Monday 13th at 10.00 a.m. and went by the mail-boat from Dover that Monday evening—no later than it would have done if I had posted it on Saturday evening. The pious English do not allow mail-steamers to leave on Sunday evening, at least not to Ostende.</p>
<p>Yours respectfully</p>
<p>Fr. Engels</p>
<p>I hope to receive 12 copies by post here on 27th or 28th inst.
</p>

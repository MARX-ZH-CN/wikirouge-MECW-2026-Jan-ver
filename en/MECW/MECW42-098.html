ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>Manchester, 21 August 1865
<br>Dear Moor,
<br>End. £20, first half, B/G 56794, Manchester, 9 January 1864, second to follow as soon as you acknowledge receipt. I cannot send more until I know how the final accounts work out, and I shall not know that until my return or even later.
<br>That business of Kirkwood's law was new to me, as it was to Moore. But is it really proven, or is it not perhaps just a hypothesis?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Surely it ought to be possible to verify a thing like that.
<br>I hope you are all restored to health now. That trouble with Laura is probably of no more consequence than with little Jenny that time, but it really is absurd of you to allow yourself to continue in such a way. In such circumstances, you should put your foot down as master of the house. I expect you have shaken off your INFLUENZA now, with the warm weather, that kind of thing really takes it out of you, but at least it is easily cured now.
<br>The old women are just coming to sweep out the office and drive me from my post; so I must quickly finish. Kindest regards.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

ENGELS TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN</p>
<p>IN HANOVER</p>
<p>[London.] 9 January 1895</p>
<p>Dear Kugelmann,</p>
<p>Please write at once to Livingston in Pittsburg and ask him for Meyer's list of <i>earlier</i> stuff; to judge by your last letter there's unlikely to be very much, but there are also sundry items, some of them anonymous, in old newspapers and compendiums of the 1843-47 period. Ask him, too, if the collection of <i>Tribune</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>articles is still in existence. At the same time I shall get other friends in America to search for such ancient tomes as may still be in existence there, so that the matter can be put in hand.</p>
<p>Many regards to your wife and daughter,</p>
<p>Yours</p>
<p>F.E.</p>
<p>Could you possibly supply me with a few of your red brass locks?

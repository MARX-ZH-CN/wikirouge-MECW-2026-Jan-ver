<p><b>Dear Fred</b>,</p>
<p><b>Thanks</b> for your marginal notes! When I wrote to you that evening I was excited. But the next morning there was already a reaction and the decision to treat the matter diplomatically, quite as you advise.</p>
<p>Ténot's <em>Province</em> is much better. It contains many new details for us. Had the Parisians held out a couple of days longer, the <em>Empire</em> would have been <em>foutu</em>. [finished] The movement (republican) among the rural population was much bigger than we knew.</p>
<p>Enclosed <em>Réveil,</em> the organ of Ledru-Rollin. Delescluze his <em>ame damnée, républicain de vieille roche, asinus.</em> He is the provisional government's commissioner who led the Belgians into the <em>guet-àpens</em> of Risquons Tout. Thus traitor or arch-<b>ass</b>. Probably the latter.</p>
<p>The stupid idea of the workers who wanted to give a banquet for [U.S. Ambassador in London] R. Johnson has been blocked <em>by us.</em> Coningsby, whose initiative it was, is a blackguard. This character was on a <b>pleasure trip to the United States</b> and was paid by Seward for this London reception for R. Johnson. He is the same <b>workman</b> who wrote to <em>The Times</em> years ago, stating that the workers were politically satisfied and <b>did not want the suffrage</b>.</p>
<p>If you could send me a few £ for the Christmas week now beginning, it would be very welcome.</p>
<p><em>Salut</em>.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.

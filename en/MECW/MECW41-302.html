MARX TO FERDINAND FREILIGRATH</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Zalt-Bommel, 23 December 1863</p>
<p>Dear Freiligrath,</p>
<p>Your letter arrived today, having been sent on to Trier by my wife and from Trier to this address by my sister.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I left London two days after you called (on Monday<sup>c</sup>). Otherwise, I should have had to keep traipsing into the CITY to see to the issue of powers of attorney for the executors of the will, which, in view of my physical condition at the time, would have been more irksome than a sea-crossing.</p>
<p>'Dr Liebknecht' has been living in <i>Berlin</i> for about a year now. His address is: <i>13 Neuenburger Strasse.</i> I know nothing about the affair.<sup>SM</sup> But one thing surprises me about the bookseller. He continued to pay Wilhelm Liebkn. the fees on behalf of the Augsburg <i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i> throughout the time L. was its correspondent. Hence it was in his power to deduct L.'s debt.</p>
<p>It was inexcusable of L., no matter what the circumstances, to make improper use of your name. But you have no responsibility whatever towards the bookseller, since Williams could have recovered the money himself.</p>
<p>Warmest regards.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

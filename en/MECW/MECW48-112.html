ENGELS TO HERMANN SCHLÜTER</p>
<p>IN HOTTINGEN-ZURICH</p>
<p>London, 10 May 1888</p>
<p>Dear Mr Schlüter,</p>
<p>What's the position as regards your coming over here? All we have heard from Ede<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> is that he is travelling via Paris and will be hanging about there for a bit. He says nothing definite about the others.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> So here we are, in a state of suspense and unable to do anything.</p>
<p>So would you be good enough to get in touch with the others and let us know when you are all arriving—yourself, Motteler and Tauscher, we presume—and whether we can do anything for you here in the mean- time. Let us also know <i>at which station</i> you will be arriving and by what route, so that you can be met. Otherwise there could be a glorious muddle, in the course of which quite a lot of money might go down the drain.</p>
<p>With kindest regards to you all</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F. Engels

Until 22 September the paper continued to appear in Switzerland, edited by the Swiss Social Democrat Conrad Consett. From 1 October 1888 to 27 September 1890 the paper was published in London.</span>

<p>MARX TO ENGELS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>London, 8 August 1858 9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, Haverstock Hill</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>If I haven't written before, this was because it wasn't till yesterday that the matter was decided <i>for certain</i> and, indeed, in the affirmative. Every time I sat down to write to you, another letter arrived from the City to say there was nothing doing and that I should try and carry out the transaction with SOMEBODY ELSE. However, I wanted to tell you something definite ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. After he had negotiated with 6 different USURERS, and every time the fellows went back on their promise when it came to the point, Freiligrath eventually discounted the bill with his own tailor, after he had agreed to act as collateral. He had, <i>ab initio,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> made it <i>payable at his own bank.</i> The old chap went to a great deal of trouble over the matter, even to the extent of taking certain steps not altogether in keeping with his 'professional' status. So if you should happen to write to him, give him a little PAT on the back, an action to which he is not wholly impervious. The bill has been deposited with Freiligrath himself. The tailor declares that he is prepared to renew it, <i>whatever the circumstances.</i> But he would prefer to receive £20 in November so that he would only have to make out a new bill for the remaining £20 payable in January. (After receiving your letter,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> I immediately informed Freiligrath that the thing could not be proceeded with <i>unless</i> there was a <i>certainty of renewal.)</i></p>
<p>To my alarm I saw from your letter that you were ill again, and in the circumstances it was all the more embarrassing to me to have ANNOYED you. Please write <i>by return</i> saying how you are, or else get Dr Gumpert to write.</p>
<p>After receiving the money, I promptly paid off as much as possible and yesterday sent my wife to Ramsgate, since there was not another day to be lost. She really is extraordinarily unwell. If Ramsgate isn't too expensive, and she is thus able to have several weeks of sea bathing, I believe all will soon be RIGHT again.</p>
<p>MEANWHILE I shall see if there's anything to be done with my mother. How I should answer the old girl in regard to my relations with Prussia is a very ticklish point. It's just <i>possible</i> that she might fork out if she thought my inheritance was under threat from the authorities. But again it's just <i>possible</i>—since she seems to me to be making her will—that she might in that case put everything in the care of the Dutchman,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> which wouldn't suit me at all. <i>Que faire dans cette situation?</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> She writes saying her days are numbered, but I believe that's just a manner of speaking. She probably wanted me to invite her to London, as indeed I would certainly have done had my time not been precious to me just now. For the past 2 months I have hardly been able to work, and the Duncker business is becoming urgent.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>I have written a lot for the <i>Tribune</i> of late so as to replenish my account a bit, but I'm getting damnably short of material. India isn't my department. Cherbourg<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> would have provided me with ample opportunity for political epigrams, except that I'm too ignorant of military matters to give the thing the proper depth. To me—though it's an altogether subjective opinion, not to say a prejudice—Cherbourg would seem to be no more than a DODGE, like all Boustrapa's40 grand doings, a mere SLEIGHT OF HAND. At any rate, the <i>Moniteur,</i> no less, contained certain ominous hints to the effect that the military authorities are by no means happy about the choice of the spot and have raised a host of circumstantial objections to the lay-out of the works. It is, furthermore, FAR FROM BEING FINISHED and, in its present state, represents rather what's <i>to be</i> than what <i>is.</i> The only thing that is completely finished is the big equestrian statue of Napoleon. In Central India, or so it seems to me, the fall of Gwalior settles the matter. The Indian papers are all very hostile to Campbell and critical of his 'tactics'.</p>
<p>Enclosed a letter from Lassalle..''<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> Ephraim Artful is a curious fellow. He demands of me AN IMMENSE DEAL OF DISCRETION and puts on a great show of secrecy, yet the whole scrawl<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> appears substantially in the <i>Kölner Zeitungl</i> There's a vein of absurd grandiloquence running through the man's letters. 'Then I addressed, etc., a trenchantly cutting memoir, etc' 'I set Böckh and Humboldt in motion.' Humboldt wrote 'a fulminating letter'. 'I myself made a complaint direct to the Prince' couched in the <i>bluntest German.'</i> 'Truly <i>foudroyant</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> arraignment of the minister<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup>Urgent plea.' 'In absolute confidence.' 'My biggest pistol.' 'Hopeless.' 'Utmost secrecy <i>and</i> discretion.' 'If that's not sauce for the gander, etc'</p>
<p>Our friend Bürgers will soon be out of prison again now. His main idea, it seems, is to play father to Daniels' children and to that end, first take over the post of bedfellow to Mrs Daniels. The latter has, however, written to Lina<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> saying that Bürgers isn't to be compared with her husband.</p>
<p>Apropos, Lupus will be interested to hear that little Jenny has received THE FIRST GENERAL PRIZE IN THE FIRST CLASS (which also includes the <i>English</i> prize), and little Laura the second. They are the youngest in the class. Jenny also got the prize for French.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i> I hope to hear some <i>good</i> news about your STATE OF HEALTH.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>The <i>Telegraph</i> (enclosed) is also to be kept.

Engels' reply of 10 August 1858 warrants the assumption that Marx wrote the letter on 8 August. On the first English publication of the letter see Note 20.—335</span>

On the invitation of the French government, Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and the Prince Consort Albert attended the ceremony. According to Napoleon III's plans, the reception given them was to relax the tension in Anglo-French relations after Orsini's attempt on the life of Napoleon III (see Note 271). However, the demonstration of France's naval strength in Cherbourg aroused new British apprehensions. In this connection Napoleon declared in a Note of 7 August 1858 that the reconstruction of the naval port did not pursue any hostile aims towards Britain.— 336, 339, 340</span>

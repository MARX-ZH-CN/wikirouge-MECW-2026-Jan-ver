ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>Manchester, 10 August 1858
<br>7 Southgate
<br>Dear Moor,
<br>Back at the office again since yesterday. I wasn't ill, by the way, merely wounded SURGICALLY and, though the wound is not yet quite healed, the purpose has been achieved. In no circumstances shall I be in a condition to do a <i>Tribune</i> article before next week.
<br>How's the Appleton affair going? You once wrote saying you were enclosing two letters from America,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> but you forgot to do so. Did they have any bearing on it? In a fortnight's time I shall probably be going to the seaside, where I might be able to get down to some hard work on the thing.
<br>Ephraim's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> letter is strange indeed. How can anyone be so stupid as to part with something like that, actually put down in black and white? That's what I really call dubbing oneself a fool à <i>perpétuité.</i>
<br>Lupus and I send our hearty congratulations to the two girls<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> on their achievements. The old chap was delighted about it. His leg is still not up to much. Borchardt undoubtedly treated the thing the wrong way and Lupus has mucked up matters by undue zeal and unnecessary foot-slogging. The thing might have other disagreeable, if not serious, consequences later on. He was in Buxton and then in Devonshire where he again had to endure the horror of bad hotels, got nothing to drink and was colossally fleeced.
<br>I hope your wife, too, is now better. The tailor will be able to have half the amount in October.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Marx means J. Weydemeyer's letter of 28 February 1858 from Milwaukee and A. Komp's letter of 15 June 1858 from New York, both written to Marx. Marx did not enclose them in his letter to Engels and they were mislaid among his papers. Some time later, Marx found them and replied to Weydemeyer on 1 February 1859 (see this volume, pp. 374-78). His letter to Komp has not been found but we may judge of its contents by the above-mentioned letter to Weydemeyer. Komp was a leader of the New York Communist Club, and his letter to Marx contained information and requests similar to those contained in a letter from Friedrich Kamm, another leader of the Club, written on 19 December 1857 (see Note 297). After replying to his American correspondents, Marx forwarded their letters to Engels on 9 February 1859 (see this volume, pp. 384-85).—324, 326, 337, 339, 374, 384</span>

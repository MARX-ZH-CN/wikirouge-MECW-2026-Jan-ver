ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 9 February 1870</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Either you are sick, or you once again cramming yourself into sickness; otherwise one would hear from you.</p>
<p>The blasted:</p>
<p><i>Ancient Laws of Ireland.</i>—<i>Senchus Mor.</i>—PART I AND II, DUBLIN, PRINTED FOR HER MAJESTY, STATIONERY OFFICE,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> the 2nd part of which appeared 3-4 weeks ago, are said to be '<i>REPRINTING',</i> and lay me completely by the heels. QUERY, can one get something of this sort SECOND HAND in London?</p>
<p>So Rochefort has quietly been put in quod. Ollivier obviously wants a collision; the barricade attempts will presumably turn out to be 'white smock'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> pranks. And if Ollivier doesn't want a collision, then Bonaparte, behind his back, does.</p>
<p>Best greetings.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">A reference to the arrest of Rochefort on 7 February 1870, in La Villette, a workers' suburb of Paris, for his article about Victor Noir's murder (see Note 516) published by<i> La Marseillaise,</i> 12 January 1870.<br><i>White smocks</i> was a name for French police agents. In June 1869, the Police Prefecture of Paris made an attempt to provoke a spontaneous outburst among the workers using the 'white smocks' who staged manifestations, built barricades, sang the<i> Marseillaise,</i> etc. Engels expressed his apprehensions that similar provocations would be staged after Rochefort's arrest.</span>

<p>To Engels in Manchester</p>
<p>[London,] 1 December 1851</p>
<p>28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>I enclose herewith: 1. Extract from Cluss' letter (from Washington) to Wolff<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> ; 2. Letter from Pieper<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> from Brussels.</p>
<p>As to No. 1, Lupus forgot to extract two more items of information which you will find not uninteresting. <i>Firstly:</i> the article 'Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Germany' has appeared in <i>German</i> in the <i>New-Yorker Abendzeitung</i>, has been reprinted in various papers and has created a furore. Cluss doesn't say whether or not this is a translation from the <i>Tribune</i>. I've written direct to Dana about it.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <i>Secondly:</i> Mr Wiss, Kinkel's principal tool, has publicly declared that 'economically' he shares our views. You can see how the curs operate.</p>
<p>As for Mr Tupman, he mentions neither our letter from Manchester nor a subsequent letter written him from here by my wife at my behest.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>But as to the <i>people in Cologne</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> it is typical of these dastardly emigre swine, who root about in all the cess-pits of the press, that they should maintain <i>la conspiration du silence</i> in this matter so as not to detract from their own importance. This must now be counteracted. Today I have sent letters to Paris attacking Prussian justice, in order to raise the matter in the press there.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> Lupus has undertaken to do the articles for America and Switzerland. <i>Maintenant</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> you must hammer out for me something for England, along with a private letter to the editor of <i>The Times</i>, to which the thing must tentatively be sent. If <i>The Times</i>, which at present is seeking to regain its popularity and would certainly feel flattered if treated as the only influential paper on the Continent and which is in any case hostile to Prussia—if <i>The Times</i> were to accept the thing, we could exert some influence in Germany. Stress should be laid on the state of the judicial system generally in Prussia.</p>
<p>Should this attempt not succeed—it can in any case do no harm—then write from Manchester direct to <i>The Sun</i>. If they receive the thing <i>before The Times</i>, the latter would not accept it under any circumstances.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p>You can hardly be aware that addresses have reached O'Connor from almost every city in England and have been published in <i>The Northern Star</i> and <i>Reynolds's Newspaper</i> in which Thornton Hunt was described as 'INFAMOUS' and the scene at 'Copenhagen Fields' roundly denounced.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> In addition there was a meeting of all the Chartist sections in London at which abuse was heaped upon Th. Hunt, who was present. When the executive committee is renewed, he will definitely be thrown out. In his desperation, this <i>allie</i> of the great Ruge now publicly proclaims himself a <i>communist</i>.</p>
<p>E. Jones—drawing on my letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> —has attacked Kossuth <i>sans miséricorde</i>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* 'I tell him that the revolutions of Europe mean the crusade of labour against capital, and I tell him they are not to be cut down to the intellectual and social standard of an obscure semi-barbarous people, like the Magyars, still standing in the half-civilisation of the 16th century, who actually presume to dictate to the great enlightenment of Germany and France, and to gain a false won cheer from the gullibility of England.'*<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You'll have seen that Kinkel will, <i>tout bonnement</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> set himself up here, after the pattern of the provisional government in France. I, for my part, believe it would be a good idea if, as soon as we know that Weydemeyer is editor of the <i>Abendzeitung</i>, you were to communicate, initially in the form of pamphlets, fragments from K. Schnapper<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup> whose first confessions I long to see. (See continuation after Pieper's letter.)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Apropos! I'd almost forgotten an important item in the <i>chronique scandaleuse</i>. Stechan, Hirsch, Gümpel, etc., in short the working men who have arrived from Germany, have announced their intention of calling on <i>me</i>. I shall receive them today. They have already considerably fallen out with Schapper and Willich. Stechan has publicly denounced Dietz as a spy before the Workers' Society<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup> and, though a few voices declared him to be an agent of Marx, effected the establishment of a committee in which, however, the chief role is played by the friends and patrons of Dietz—Schapper and Willich. At all events I shall use these Straubingers<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup> to precipitate fresh crises in the wretched hostel for tailors and idlers.</p>
<p>I herewith acknowledge receipt of the £3.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K.M.

The reformist Thornton Hunt, chairman of the Chartist committee responsible for organising the meeting, tried to prevent O'Connor from attending on the pretext that he was insane. This aroused violent protests on the part of the Chartists and O'Connor was admitted to the meeting. To justify himself Hunt made a demagogic declaration in <i>The Northern Star</i> on 29 November describing himself as a zealous defender of people's interests and calling himself a communist. As Marx foresaw, Hunt was not elected to the new Executive of the National Charter Association.</span>

<br>Dear Engels,
<br>Meyer (R.) wrote [on 29 August 1879] and announced his intention of visiting me, while at the same time saying, on the other hand, that I was to let him know, i.e. telegraph him, '<b>Do not come',</b> should I be otherwise engaged. <b>Firstly</b>, therefore, I telegraphed him in the 'negative', secondly, however, proceeded to write him a letter *to this effect, that in consequence of Mrs Marx's bad health my whole time is taken up 'presently'*. I am telling you this in order that you may know how things stand, should he raise the matter with you. In fact my wife is <b>improving</b> only very slowly and hence <b>by no means anxious to see Meyer here</b>.
<br>Jennychen had her first outing today, a fifteen minute walk; <b>She progresses favourably</b>.
<br>Your<br>Moor
<br>How is jolly getting on?

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Argenteuil,] 22 June 1882</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>Your letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>arrived no more than a minute or two before the post which goes damned early. Hence only a few words.</p>
<p>I have not been able to REPORT PROGRESS until today because the sulphur operations were suspended from Sunday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>until yesterday inclusive on account of the rainy weather and did not begin again until today. AT PRESENT TIME it's devilish cold at Cauterets and the season there doesn't NORMALLY begin until the middle of JULY. SO in the event Enghien has proved most opportune, although up till now the weather has not been good enough to permit UNINTERRUPTED use of the <i>institution thermale.</i> Other people, who need not be careful about a <i>résidu</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>wouldn't have to bother so much. Dr Dourlen says that the whole difficulty lies in avoiding anything that might cause a recurrence of pleurisy.</p>
<p>Let the chaps in New York go ahead with their own 'reprint', though they must take care that there are no unauthorised additions.</p>
<p>We shall, then, expect Helen<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>on Sunday. It is still too early — for I must fight shy of all lengthy conversations just now — to advise Lavrov of my presence. He's just the man to make me prattle on for hours.</p>
<p>Love to Jennychen.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

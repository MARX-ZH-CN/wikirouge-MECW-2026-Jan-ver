Note from MECW :</p><blockquote>
<p>On July 20, 1881 Norris A. Clowes, the New-York Star correspondent, asked Engels to write a review of the British labour movement. Being pressed for time, Engels referred him to his articles which The Labour Standard was at the time publishing as editorials. In response to Clowes' stated wish to enter into communication with Most, Engels advised him to write to the Freiheit editorial board. In this letter to the Freiheit, which is printed according to the manuscript, Engels informs the editorial board about this. The letter is written in German and English.</p>
<p>This letter was first published in the original in MEGA2, Abt. I, Bd. 25, Berlin, 1985, S. 274.

</blockquote><p>[London,] July 22, 1881</p>
<p>To the Editor of the "Freiheit"</p>
<p><br>
Mr. Norris A. Clowes, the New York Star's correspondent in Ireland, who has been recommended to me from America,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> has written as follows:</p>
<p>* "If Herr Most would like to make any statement to the New York Star public, I should be glad to give him the opportunity."*</p>
<p>To which I replied:</p>
<p>* "If you wish to enter into communication with Mr. Most, you had better write to the Editor<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> of the Freiheit, 252 Tottenham Court Road, W. London, who will be able to tell you whether such communication will be possible under present circumstances."*<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>I hasten to bring this to your attention.</p>
<p><br>
Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>F. E.

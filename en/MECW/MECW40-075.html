<p>TO ENGELS IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p><br>
[London,] Friday, 3 July [1857]</p>
<p>9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, Haverstock Hill</p>
<p><br>
Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Shall be writing tomorrow. This is just to inform you that -the second half of the note had still not arrived by this evening.</p>
<p>Considering the bad luck which has been dogging me of late, it may well have got lost. I couldn't go to Williams' since my wife's condition has meant—pretty well ever since you left<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> —that I can't leave her on her own.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

<hr/><p>[London,] 3 July [1857]</p>
<p>DEAR Frederic,</p>
<p>I am writing again TO GAINSAY my earlier note. No. II arrived on the stroke of 6. No letter has ever arrived so late before, and hence I wrote in order to avert possible MISCHIEF.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

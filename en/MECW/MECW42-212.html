ENGELS TO MARX<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 13 March 1867</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>The reason I have not written to you is in part that all manner of things have prevented me, but in part also it was deliberate, as I wanted to let the date pass when 'the book'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>was due to be completed, and now I hope that it is ready. So, when will you be going to see Mr Meissner? When you do, I will give you an authorisation to collect the fee for my last pamphlet.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Apropos the latter, by now the Lassallean gentlemen will have had time enough to convince themselves how right I was about the effect of universal suffrage and the power it would give the aristocracy in the countryside.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>The Lassallean gentlemen <i>failed</i> to get <i>2 men</i> through; the two Saxon workers' candidates<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>who did get through are very dubious and appear to be rather of Wuttke's ilk. As a whole, incidentally, the elections did show that in Germany they are not remotely susceptible to the kinds of pressure that can be applied to them in France, and that is already to the good.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>I am also convinced that the more bureaucratic meddling there is, the worse each fresh election in Germany will turn out for the government, and that 15 years of government-controlled elections such as we have had in France are impossible in our country.</p>
<p>But what a fine lot we have in the noble House,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>to be sure! They may pull a wry face but they won't offer much protest as they are bartering away the few lousy safeguards still contained in the Prussian constitution for the indirect annexation of the 6 million people in the little states, who have <i>de facto</i> already been annexed and mediatised without any constitution at all.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup><i>Au fond,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>it is quite immaterial what nonsense the fellows contrive; with the philistines in their present mood of Bismarckolatry, they represent bourgeois public opinion and will only do what the latter wants. The worthy burgher seems determined to avoid any further 'conflict'. The movement—both at home, where it is now bestirring itself once more, and in Europe—will soon enough leave all this ordure behind and turn to the real issues of the day.</p>
<p>Scoundrel Schweitzer offered himself for election here, there and everywhere, but got nowhere. I have been sent 2 pamphlets about him from Barmen, of which one enclosed and the other, shorter one, to follow; I do not have it with me. The enclosed obviously bears the mark of the Hatzfeldt lot.</p>
<p>Stieber is again creating in the <i>Volks-Zeitung</i> over Eichhoff's pieces in the <i>Hermann,</i> Koller is also mentioned. See <i>Hermann.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The moderate result of universal suffrage in Germany has, in any case, contributed to the sudden popularity of HOUSEHOLD SUFFRAGE in official circles here. It would be splendid if HOUSEHOLD SUFFRAGE got through as a result, there would soon be a good many changes here and the movement would get going.</p>
<p>TRADE HERE is still stagnant to an exceeding degree. India and China have been swamped by the consignments from the manufacturers, 20,000 people are on STRIKE in Stockport, SHORT TIME is spreading and, if this does not change soon, in May we shall have a superb crisis of overproduction. That can only benefit the <i>radical</i> reform movement.</p>
<p><i>The Diplomatic Review</i> is excellent this time.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup>Provided old D. Urquhart gets hold of FACTS, he is ALL RIGHT; but Beust's curious manoeuvres had already aroused my suspicions. Notwithstanding the fact that the Saxons (<i>vide</i> Mr von Seebach in the Crimean War) have always been in cahoots with the Russians, notwithstanding the fact that Beust sent that ostentatiously rude despatch to the Russians during the Danish war, I do, nevertheless, find it difficult to decide whether the Russians have <i>actually bought</i> the fellow or whether they have got him gratis and without being aware of it. It almost seems to me that the boundless vanity of that little Saxon shit suffices to explain the whole affair — the Russians naturally KNOW HOW TO IMPROVE THE OCCASION.</p>
<p>As an exercise in vulgar democracy, I have recently...<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup></p>

Two Saxon constituencies elected August Bebel, who became the first ever working-class representative in the German parliament and the lawyer Reinhold Schraps, the candidate of the Saxon People's Party. Wilhelm Liebknecht had been in prison for three months until the middle of January and was therefore unable to organise an election campaign and to win the elections.</span>

Besides its direct annexation of certain territories (see Note 355), it compelled Austria to agree to the disbandment of the German Confederation, and also succeeded in signing alliance treaties with 17 North German states (north of the Main) which had fought in the war on its side; later on Saxony and other German states joined alliance treaties. This form of union prepared the ground for the formation of the North German Confederation.</span>

Under this statement of Stieber's the editors placed a statement by R. Hirschfeld, the owner of the print-shop where at that time the weekly had been printed. Hirschfeld's statement cited facts showing Stieber's attempt to bribe the editorial board in January 1860. On 8 March 1867 the <i>Volks-Zeitung</i> carried a new statement by Stieber, in which he again denied his attempt.</span>

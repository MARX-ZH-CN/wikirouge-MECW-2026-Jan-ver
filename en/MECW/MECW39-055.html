ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 19 May 1852</p>
<p>Dear Marx,</p>
<p><i>Les</i> <i>affaires</i> <i>vont</i> <i>bien</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Tomorrow or the day after my old man will be leaving again, very satisfied with his affairs. The business here is to be completely reorganised and will be run on a new basis. I have succeeded in obtaining a rise and, as soon as the contracts have been signed and my old man is out of the way, the banknote I promised you will materialise. The best thing about all this is that I am signing nothing at all; my old man was wise enough not to trust me entirely on the political score, thus perhaps safeguarding himself against becoming involved through me in any further unpleasantness. Moreover, in this case, and providing certain proprieties are observed, I can arrange to be replaced by one of my brothers in such a way that my old man would lose nothing by my departure save, perhaps, a few illusions, and it would be I, not he, who would be making the sacrifice. Let me know by return how your character-sketches<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> are going. All these changes are going to saddle me with a fair amount of work for a while, so that there would seem to be no immediate prospect of our doing very much together, and yet I should like very much to see you here as soon as possible. It would therefore be good if you and Dronke could complete the things so far as you are able, after which we could polish them off here in a few evenings. And before you come up I would make the necessary extracts about the people in question (whose names you must give me) from the documents up here, thereby enabling us to get on quickly. It has just occurred to me that it would be best for you to come at Whitsun, i.e. on the previous Friday—the day after tomorrow week—when there are general HOLIDAYS here. If the weather is fine we can go to the Isle of Man or somewhere, and if bad we shall work. But mind you come on your own. I should be very glad to see Dronkius later on, but I have no use for him just now, and he would only disturb our work.</p>
<p>By the way, the best thing about the new arrangement is that, as from 1 July, not only shall I have more money, but it will be all <i>mine</i>, so that no one will have any right to ask what use I make of it. Further details when we meet.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 26 April 1869</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>BEST THANKS FOR THE INVITATION. But it is quite impossible for me TO LEAVE AT THIS MOMENT. My wife is coughing badly, and I am waiting that out; as soon as she can travel, she will go to Paris TO FETCH TUSSY.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>I shall perhaps come u p with the latter.</p>
<p>In addition there are some things to put in order in the International this week, which won't get going without me.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>And finally, however bad I might feel, I have to complete CERTAIN SLIPS OF PAPER, since it is always difficult to continue, not with A NEW SUBJECT, but in the middle of a certain topic.</p>
<p>WITH ALL THAT, if I don't get better, I shall naturally have to go away.</p>
<p>More tomorrow.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.
</p>

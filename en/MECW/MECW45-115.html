ENGELS TO THOMAS ALLSOP
<br>IN LIMINGTON
<br>London, 17 October 1876
<br>122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.
<br>My dear Friend,
<br>I have just been informed by Marx of the very, very heavy blow which has fallen upon you in the shape of the death of your wife. I fully realise the dreadful, dreary feeling of loneliness which this bereavement, after fifty years of happiness, must have thrown you into. At the same time I know your character well enough to be assured that, with time, you will get the better of it, and not give way to despondency. You are bound to live until you see at least the first instalment of the victory of that cause for which you have now worked and struggled for fully two generations; and there are events now preparing in the East which must hasten, and may bring about, the downfall of the old political and social system. In the meantime, rest assured that from the depth of my heart I feel with you in your affliction, and so does my wife. I say no more. I know that consolation in such a case would seem a mockery. With heartfelt sympathy
<br>Ever yours faithfully,
<br>Frederick Engels

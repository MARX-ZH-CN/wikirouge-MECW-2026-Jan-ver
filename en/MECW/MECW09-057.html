<br>Not a word from the theatre of war. Not a syllable confirming the fabulous report of Bem's crossing into Wallachia, which may now be regarded as pure martial-law rumour, since after the arrival of the alleged courier no Bulletin has appeared.
<br>There is, on the other hand, interesting news of the Austrian Slavs. Among the <em>Czech</em> townspeople and peasants, says the Augsburg <em>Allgemeine Zeitung, Kossuth's</em> name is regarded with the same respect and wonder as Napoleon's, and people were arrested in Prague for raising a cheer for Kossuth. The <em>Südslavische Zeitung</em> writes from Vinkovci, March 24:

<blockquote>
<br>"Travellers brought to us the news that extraordinary excitement reigns in <em>Semlin</em>. Street processions in Hungarian costume, Hungarian freedom songs, <em>Eljens</em> and <em>Zivios</em> for Kossuth resounding through the town."

</blockquote>
<br>Todorovich has withdrawn from Kanlzsa to Kikinda (between the Theiss and the Maros), and has thus by no means united with Jellachich. The blockade of Szegedin and Theresiopel has therefore been <em>competely raised.</em> This retreat obviously took place as a result of the discontent among the Serbs.
<br>The cause of this dampening down of the Serbian lust for plunder is Austria's vacillating policy, making promises to the Serbs today, to the Magyars tomorrow, and regarding the rich Hungarian aristocracy (which can easily be restored to power and influence again after an Austrian victory) as a better ally in the long run than the chaos of classes, interests and conditions of the South-Slav and especially the Serbian provinces.
<br>For the amusement of our readers we print the latest martial-law rumour:
<br>Kossuth is said to be involved in negotiations with the Government and to be making the following condition for Hungary's complete and immediate submission: the acceptance of the Constitution drafted by the Imperial Diet<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> for the whole monarchy and his appointment as the Governor of Hungary!!!
<br>Baja has not yet been retaken, Nugent bombarded it in vain.
<br>Bem has imposed a contribution of 100,000 florins on Hermannstadt. The Romanians are quite discouraged; a <em>Landsturm</em> can no longer be raised.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The reference is to the draft Constitution drawn up in Kremsier by the Austrian Constituent Imperial Diet. In early March 1849 it was dissolved by the Austrian Government which countered this draft with the Constitution imposed by the Emperor 
An allusion to the new <i>Constitution</i> of the Austrian united monarchy <i>(Gesamtmonarchie)</i> introduced by Francis Joseph on <i>March 4, 1849.</i> According to the Constitution, the Emperor and his Ministers were vested with full executive authority and the bureaucratic centralisation principle was strictly implemented in the administration of the Empire. Lombardy, Venice, Hungary and Bohemia were proclaimed Austrian crown lands and the autonomous estate institutions that existed in some national regions even before the 1848 revolution were abolished Croatia, Serbian Voivodina and Transylvania likewise did not receive autonomy, repeated promises notwithstanding; they separated from Hungary administratively and a system of administration similar to that in other crown lands was established there. The Constitution of March 4, 1849, was a step towards the restoration of absolutism (it was finally restored by the imperial patent of December 31. 1851, which repealed constitutional rule) and was unpopular even among the Right-wing elements in the Slav national movement in Austria, who cherished the hope that the Habsburgs would satisfy their national demands. 
The reference is to the dissolution of the Austrian Constituent Imperial Diet <i>(Reichstag)</i> by Emperor Francis Joseph on March 7, 1849. He was prompted to do this by his mother Archduchess Sophia and the Court camarilla. The Imperial Diet opened in Vienna on July 22, 1848. Prior to this, on May 15, as a result of the mass revolutionary actions, the Government was forced to recognise the constituent rights of the Imperial Diet to be convened. The majority of its deputies, however, representing the liberal bourgeoisie and landowners (including deputies from the Slav national districts), opposed any extension of the revolution. During the Vienna popular uprising in October 1848, the Imperial Diet transferred its seat to the Moravian town of Kremsier. There, on March 4, 1849 the consultative commission it had set up completed a Draft of Fundamental Rights providing for people's sovereignty, freedom of assembly and the press, equality of estates and nationalities, while retaining the monarchy. The draft, however, was not approved because the coup d'etat took place the same day and the new, anti-democratic Constitution.

Was introduced by royal decree. Three days later the Diet itself was dissolved.
The Kremsier draft, though it contained some concessions to the great-power and centralising tendencies of the German aristocratic ruling circles, envisaged a certain administrative independence for a number of national regions of the Empire and introduced provincial diets as representative institutions there</span>

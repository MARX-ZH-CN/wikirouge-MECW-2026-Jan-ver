<p><i>To Nikolai Danielsonb in St Petersburg</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 15 August 1872</b></p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I hope you have received the first part of the second German edition [of Volume I of Capital] which I have sent you a few days since. I shall also send you the first 6 <i>livraisons</i> of the French edition which will be out in a few days. It is necessary to compare <i>both editions</i> because I have added and changed here and there in the French edition.</p>
<p>Your interesting letter I have received and shall answer to it in a few days. I have also received the manuscript and the article of the <i>Vestnik</i>.</p>
<p>To-day I write in all haste, for one special purpose which is of the <i>most urgent</i> character.</p>
<p>Bakunin has worked secretly since years to undermine the International and has now been pushed by us so far as to throw away the mask and <i>secede openly</i> with the foolish people led by him — the same man who was the manager in the Nechayev affair. Now this Bakunin was once charged with the Russian translation of my book [of Volume I of Capital], received the money for it in advance, and instead of giving work, sent or had sent to Lubanin (I think) who transacted for the publisher with him the affair, a most infamous and compromising letter. It would be of the highest utility for me, <i>if this letter was sent me</i> immediately. As this is a mere <i>commercial</i> affair and as in the use to be made of the letter no names will be used, I hope you will procure me that letter. But no time is to be lost. If it is sent, it ought to be sent at once as I shall leave London for the Haag Congress at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Yours very truly,<br>A. Williams

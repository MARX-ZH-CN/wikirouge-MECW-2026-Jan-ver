<p>The citizens assembled in a mass meeting in Cologne on September 20,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>considering: that the decision of the Frankfurt National Assembly of the 16th, approving the dishonourable armistice with Denmark, is a betrayal of the German people and of the honour of German arms, declare:</p>
<p>Article 1. The members of the Frankfurt so-called National Assembly, with the exception of those who have announced to the people their readiness to resign, are traitors to the people;</p>
<p>Article 2. The fighters at the barricades in Frankfurt have rendered a meritorious service to the fatherland.</p>
<p>This proclamation is to be distributed as widely as possible by wall-posters and through the press.</p>
<p>The office of the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> is prepared to accept contributions for the support of the insurgents and their families.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> </p>

TO MARX IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester,] Wednesday [26 February 1851]</p>
<p>Dear Marx,</p>
<p>I have just come upon your 2nd letter. I at once wrote another one to Harney: if you approve of it, send it on to him forthwith.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> This infamous affair is altogether too much, and he's got to be made aware of the fact. If he allies himself with the others, <i>tant pis pour lui</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I CARE THE DEVIL.</p>
<p>Enclosed a letter which looks very odd to me.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> What's behind the whole business? I don't know to what extent red Wolff<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> is his own master. Besides, there's so much that's crack-brained about the letter that I can't reply to it without having further information. So let me know at once what kind of a DODGE this is and return the piffle to me. One o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p>Having no STAMPS, I shan't be able to put any on this letter as I am now going out to post it.

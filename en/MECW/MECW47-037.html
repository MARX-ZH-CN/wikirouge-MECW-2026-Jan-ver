ENGELS TO VERA ZASULICH</p>
<p>IN GENEVA</p>
<p>London, 13 November 1883 122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Citizen,</p>
<p>I am not really in a position to answer the questions you have been so good as to put to me.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>The publication of the second volume of <i>Capital</i> in the original text, continues to be delayed. Up till now I have had to confine my attention mainly to the 3rd edition of the first volume.</p>
<p>So far I have heard nothing at all from St Petersburg in regard to a Russian translation of the 2nd volume. Nor, for that matter, do I believe that, as things are now, there could be any question of publishing a work of this kind in the Russian capital; no doubt they would first want to take a look at the German text.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the political situation in Russia is now so tense that a crisis might supervene any day. I even think it probable that the press will be free in Russia before it becomes so in Germany. And in that case the translator of the first volume, TepMaHT. Aona- THHT),<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>could, with some reason, claim the right to translate the second.</p>
<p>I do not, therefore, believe that the time is yet ripe for an attempt to arrive at a final decision on this matter, but must thank you sincerely for your kind offer which I shall bear in mind. Perhaps we shall be able to see things more clearly in a month or two, and then we can renew our discussion on the subject.</p>
<p>It pleases me very much to hear that it is you who have undertaken to translate my <i>Entwicklung etc.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>; I look forward eagerly to seeing your work and fully appreciate the honour you have done me.</p>
<p>I am, my dear and courageous citizen,</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>F. Engels</p>
<p>To Citizen Vera Zasulich

MARX TO HERMANN JUNG</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 8 January 1870</p>
<p>My dear Jung,</p>
<p>First Shaw's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <i>funérailles,</i> afterwards other incidents have prevented me from sending you earlier the 'missive' to Geneva.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>There are <i>des changements</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> in the text—I have struck away, I have added some sentences, and very often corrected the phraseology.</p>
<p>Hence you must copy the thing anew (as quickly as possible) so that the text I send to day to Bruxelles be conform with that sent to Geneva. As soon as you have done, put the thing into the hands of Dupont.</p>
<p>With compliments to your family</p>
<p>Yours truly</p>
<p>Karl Marx</p>
<p>I have, besides the copy of the Geneva 'missive', made a full report to the Bruxelles Comité<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> <i>pour les encourager et aussi un peu</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> to show them the theoretical nonsense preached at Geneva.

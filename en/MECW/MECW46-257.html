ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH THEODOR CUNO
<br>IN NEW YORK
<br>London, 29 March 1883
<br>Dear Cuno,
<br>Your letter evoked roars of laughter over here.<sup>5</sup> Anyone who knew Moor as he was at home and within his intimate circle, is aware that he was never called Marx there, or even Karl, but only Moor, just as each of us had his own nickname; indeed, at the point where nicknames ceased so too did the closest intimacy. Moor had been his nickname since his university days and on the <i>Neue Rheinische Leitung</i> he was always called Moor. If I had addressed him in any other way he would have thought something was amiss that needed putting right.
<br>Your
<br>F. Engels

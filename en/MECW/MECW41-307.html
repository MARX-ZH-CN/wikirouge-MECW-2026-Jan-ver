MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>London, 25 February 1864</p>
<p>DEAR Frederick,</p>
<p>Just a few lines for the present to let you know of my return.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>As soon as the weather permits, I shall come up to Manchester for <i>2 days</i> so as to see you in person again and, at the same time, give you an account of my AFFAIRS.</p>
<p>I have completely recovered and only one or two spots (specially on the upper part of my leg), which are in the final stages of healing up, continue to trouble me A LITTLE.. I haven't grown thin, but stout, despite my illness. True, I have given up smoking completely.</p>
<p>Pieper's sudden appearance on our doorstep was a real surprise. He's here to settle in his sister as a GOVERNESS. He spent 4 yrs as a schoolmaster in Bremen. Last year 'he ate the bread of the National Association','<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>and even went to Italy at Augustenburg's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>expense. He's the same bore and lout as he always was.</p>
<p>With kind regards to you and Lupus.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

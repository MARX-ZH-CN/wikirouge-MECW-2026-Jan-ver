MARX TO HERMANN JUNG</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 11 October 1871</p>
<p>Dear Jung,</p>
<p>From the enclosed letter of Perret<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>you will see that he has not yet received the Resolutions on the 'Alliance', etc.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>If you have not yet sent them, do not do so, because I shall send you a corrected copy.</p>
<p><i>£1</i> I have sent to Rozwadowski. Give from the refugees' money so much to Duru that he can leave the lodgings he now lives in which are too dear considering their miserable state. It would be well, if Duru received money enough to get his things out of the pawning shop. But my opinion is that he should take them not to his present lodgings but depose them in your house and leave his lodgings <i>without paying the rest of his house-rent I</i> He has already paid more than was really due for such a hole.</p>
<p>Give also say <i>£1</i> to the <i>nouveau venu</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>of whom you spoke yesterday.</p>
<p>These expenses—this employment of part of the money remitted to us from the United States—I shall defend so soon as the disposal of those moneys will come before the Council.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Yours fraternally,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

The money was later sent to the General Council to be distributed among the refugees. A deputation from the Society of Commune Refugees in London (see Note 378) attended the meeting of the General Council on 29 August 1871 to demand an account of how the émigré fund was being distributed. A resolution proposed by Engels was adopted, recognising the donors as the only persons with the right to monitor the actions of the General Council in this respect. At the Council's meeting of 16 October 1871 Marx insisted that the money should be distributed by the General Council to those Commune refugees who were hardest hit.</span>

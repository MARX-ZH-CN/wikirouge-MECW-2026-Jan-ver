MARX TO ENGELS
<br>IN RYDE
<br>[London,] 17 September<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> [1857]
<br>Dear Engels,
<br><b>Bernadotte</b> is a difficult subject. The French generals who wrote under Louis Philippe are mostly his unqualified PARTISANS, just as the present writers under Boustrapa<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> are his unqualified opponents. The main points at issue upon which I should appreciate information from you are:
<br>1. His part in the battle of Austerlitz<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> as a consequence of the manoeuvres he executed before the same.
<br>2. His conduct at the batde of Jena<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> ; and <i>before</i> the batüe of Eylau.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> <br>3. His conduct at the battle of Wagram.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> <br>As regards his embassy in Vienna, things were not quite as you present them.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> It has been <i>shown</i> (by <i>inter alia</i> Schlosser, <i>Zur Beurtheilung Napoleons)</i> that the Bonapartist journals in Paris denounced Bernadotte as a royalist because he did <i>not</i> hang out the French flag. They drove him into taking the step which Bonaparte subsequently disavowed.
<br>All in all, Bonaparte sensed that Bernadotte was the 'statesman' amongst his generals and one intent on pursuing his 'own plans'. He, and more notably his brothers, by their base and petty intrigues against Bernadotte, gave him greater prominence than he could otherwise have laid claim to.
<br>Napoleon was, in general, beastly to anyone he suspected of 'self-seeking'.
<br>Your
<br>K. M.
<br><i>Blücher.</i> I'd like you to write something about his principal battles, his military qualities generally and, finally, the tactical merits upon which Griesheim lays so much stress.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> <br><i>Bessières, Brune, Brown, Bugeaud,</i> ditto. <i>Bosquet</i> in the Crimean campaign. Let me have Dana's list of B's as I have lost my copy.
<br>Your
<br>K. M.

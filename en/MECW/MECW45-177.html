MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN RAMSGATE</p>
<p>[London,] 23 July 1877</p>
<p>Dear Fred,</p>
<p>The enclosed <i>Journal des Débats</i> is already a bit out of date but is not without interest, notably the LEADER on the oriental war and the articles from Russia. Also, <i>Volksfreund,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> which seems to have become Mr Dühring's monitor. Collet's 'ENGLAND, ENEMY OF TURKEY', etc.</p>
<p>I had intended to pay you a two- or three-day visit in Ramsgate; a trip to see Gumpert would be pointless for I know BY HEART, both from him and from the Karlsbad doctors and professors, everything that medical science <i>cannot</i> do in this particular case. Besides, my <i>insomnie</i> is somewhat better. But <i>un homme propose et l'autre dispose.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> The other, in this instance, being Hirsch who has come to London for the express purpose of spending a week in my company. More about him and what he has told me in the course of this epistle. But <i>tout d'abord,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> my plans for the immediate future.</p>
<p>I intend to leave shortly, if possible on 12th August, for <i>Neuenahr</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> and <i>not for Karlsbad,</i> and this for the following reasons:</p>
<p><i>First, because of the expense:</i> As you know, my wife suffers from serious digestive disturbances and, since I shall in any case be taking Tussy who has had another nasty attack, my wife would take great exception to being left behind. For the three of us plus luggage—if, for the sake of the cure one travels at one's leisure as I have several times done—the journey there and back would alone amount to £70. Moreover I long ago promised Lenchen,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> who is very much run down, to convey her to her home where she cannot live completely gratis. Moreover, the family has all sorts of purchases to make for the trip.</p>
<p><i>Secondly:</i> In unguarded moments, the Karlsbad doctors have themselves told me that, if one didn't want to visit Karlsbad every year, Neuenahr might be beneficial as an <i>intermezzo.</i> Of course, they would rather one always went to Karlsbad. But it might be better even from the viewpoint of hygiene to make a change for once and take less potent waters, for <i>variatio delectat corpus.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> Besides, my trouble is not so much my LIVER as the nervous upset occasioned by it. Hence, less potent waters, but of <i>essentiellement</i> the same composition.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is one important matter I have always neglected because of the expense—the after-cure. In view of the greatly reduced travelling expenses and the fact that the house will be shut up (under Withers' care) for the duration of the cure, all these birds would be killed with one stone by exchanging Karlsbad for Neuenahr.</p>
<p>HENCE q.e.d. I hope you approve. Now for other matters—first of all Hirsch. He has turned out very well and has not been wasting his time. I tried him out, amongst other things, on the subject of French statistics and found him to be <i>à la hauteur</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> He also gave me some very interesting information about the <i>almost universal</i> transformation of French industrial concerns into JOINT STOCK COMPANIES. In the first place, this was facilitated by legislation in the days of the Empire. In the second, the French are not partial to business, preferring whenever possible to live as rentiers. And to which end this form of business is, of course, A GODSEND.</p>
<p>According to Hirsch (and here he may be taking too rosy a view) the officers of the French Army, with the exception of those at the top, are republican. However that may be, it is a FACT and a typical one, that Galliffet (the incident with <i>la</i> Beaumont<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> really did take place, as Hirsch ascertained, according to further <i>recherches</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> ) offered his services to Mr Gambetta in a letter written in his own hand, and that the self-same Galliffet, after the <i>préfet</i> of his garrison town had been dismissed by Broglie, called on the disgraced <i>préfet,</i> together with his general staff, to proffer his condolences. If these things occur in a dry tree, etc.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> On the other hand, there is a widespread belief among the non-commissioned officers, largely consisting of new men, that Mac-Mahon got rid of the Chamber because it had put forward a series of proposals intended to improve the lot of non-commissioned officers.</p>
<p>Everything that happens at the Elysée<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> daily becomes common knowledge in Paris, for the Bonapartist <i>tapageurs</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> who frequent the place cannot hold their tongues. Mac-Mahon is exceedingly embittered. The brute, whose first historic words were: <i>J'y suis, j'y reste,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> his second being: <i>C'est assez,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup> is now uttering his last one. All he says from morn till night is: <b>Merde!</b><i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup> </i></p>
<p>Hirsch is furious with the <i>Vorwärts</i> over the Dühring business as well as 'Nieder mit der Republik!'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup> He wrote an exceedingly brusque letter to the executive (Geib, etc.)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup> about both these. He, too, now realises that fusion has degraded the party, both in theory and in practice.</p>
<p>With reference to 'Nieder mit der Republik!', he remarked that the great Hasenclever as a Prussian soldier (probably a reservist or militia man) was at the gates of Paris at the time of the Commune, and hence has no reason to lay down the law in matters of principle.</p>
<p>He maintains that, at the time of the Prussian conflict,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" id="cite_ref-18">[18]</a></sup> Hasenclever was editor of a progressist<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" id="cite_ref-19">[19]</a></sup> paper in Krefeld,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" id="cite_ref-20">[20]</a></sup> sold it to an ultra-reactionary, and gravely compromised himself in the course of a lawsuit arising out of the sale. This, as Bracke himself told him, was known to Bracke and Co. when they appointed Hasenclever co-editor with Liebknecht of the <i>Vorwärts.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" id="cite_ref-21">[21]</a></sup></p>
<p>Liebknecht, MEANWHILE, <i>est puni par où il a péché.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" id="cite_ref-22">[22]</a></sup> The Lassallean gang is doing everything it can to harass and humiliate him. For instance, they reproach him with the pittance he is paid by the <i>Vorwärts,</i> say his wife (with five children) doesn't need a maid, etc. They have, contrary to all party and journalistic practice, deliberately so organised things that Liebknecht has to go to jug for all articles,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23" id="cite_ref-23">[23]</a></sup> even if written during his absence, thus in fact playing the same role on the <i>Vorwärts</i> as the man of straw on a French paper.</p>
<p>Next month Hirsch is leaving Paris for Berlin where he is going to take over the editorship of the lithographed party papers for a month<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24" id="cite_ref-24">[24]</a></sup> and proposes to do so in such a way as to mortify the allied riffraff.</p>
<p>I enclose herewith a letter from the <i>Zukunft,</i> in case you have not also received one.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25" id="cite_ref-25">[25]</a></sup> Send it back to me for answering.</p>
<p>What a nice piece of cunning on the part of 'citizen', 'thinker' and 'socialist of the future' Most. So a second fusion is planned; ourselves, combined with Mr Dühring, for he'll be there without fail; at the same time, our names under the editorship of Most and Co. will mean our swallowing all their infamies in public, and most gratefully at that! In which case I would infinitely sooner have obliged Wiede.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26" id="cite_ref-26">[26]</a></sup> But I am obliged to Most for having given me the opportunity of tendering my refusal. These fellows imagine they are dealing with 'babes and sucklings'. <i>Quelle impudence!</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27" id="cite_ref-27">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>I should say that the Russians have grossly miscalculated with their sabre-rattling; and when unsoldierly <i>coups de tête</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28" id="cite_ref-28">[28]</a></sup> of this kind don't come off HERE AND THEN, their effect on their own army and the public is highly and miserably compromising, particularly so soon after the EXIT from Armenia.</p>
<p>Friend Lopatin, it seems, has in the meantime again waxed unpatriotic.</p>
<p>I trust that your wife is feeling better. <i>Salut</i> to all.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Moor

The author went on to say that about two weeks previously, at a ball in Paris, in a fit of jealousy Galliffet had seriously wounded his mistress Mme de Beaumont, President Mac-Mahon's sister-in-law, and had consequently been imprisoned. The Paris papers hushed up the scandal. The <i>Vorwärts</i> viewed this unsavoury story, with a hangman of the Paris Commune as its protagonist, as striking proof of the degeneration of bourgeois society. Marx learned the details of the scandal from Carl Hirsch, who arrived in London from Paris about 20 July.</span>

The first of them was an editorial 'Zum jüngsten Staatsstreich des Herrn Mac-Mahon'. The editorial board took a nihilist stand on these events, implying that it was immaterial to the proletariat whether it was campaigning under a bourgeois republic or a monarchy. These views were stated most directly in the editorial 'Nieder mit der Republik!' (Down with the Republic!) featured by the <i>Vorwärts</i> on 1 July 1877 and written, most probably, by Wilhelm Hasenclever.</span>

<li id="cite_note-17"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-17">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">In line with the decision of the Gotha unity congress of 1875 (see Note 71), the leading bodies of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany were the Executive Committe (Vorstand), Control Commission (Controlkomission) and Committee (Ausschuss). The Executive Committee elected at the Gotha Congress had five members: Hasenclever and Hartmann, the chairmen; Auer and Derossi, the secretaries, and Geib, the treasurer. Thus the Executive came to comprise three Lassalleans (Hasenclever, Hartmann and Derossi) and two Eisenachers (Auer and Geib). The Executive Committee was to be based in Hamburg.</span>

However, the government soon managed to secure allocations from the Provincial Diet to 'maintain the army ready for action', which in fact meant the beginning of the planned reorganisation. When, in March 1862, the liberal majority of the Chamber refused to approve military spending and demanded a ministry accountable to the Provincial Diet, the government dissolved the Diet and announced new elections. The Bismarck Ministry was formed at the end of September 1862. In October, it again dissolved the Provincial Diet and began to carry out the military reform without the sanction of the Diet. The conflict was settled only in 1866 when, after Prussia's victory over Austria, the Prussian bourgeoisie gave in to Bismarck.</span>

The party's programme included the unification of Germany under the aegis of Prussia, the convocation of an all-German Parliament, and the formation of a strong liberal ministry accountable to the Chamber of Deputies. Fearing a popular revolution, the Party of Progress gave no support to the basic democratic demands—universal suffrage and freedoms of the press, association and assembly. In 1866 the party split, and its Right wing founded the National Libera] Party, which capitulated to the Bismarck government.</span>

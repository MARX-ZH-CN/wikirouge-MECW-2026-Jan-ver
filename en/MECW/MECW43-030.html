<br>Dear Friend
<br>I was prevented by all sorts of incidents from writing to you. Even now only a few lines.
<br>My eldest and youngest daughters have both got scarlatina. I remember that in Hanover you spoke to me of the treatment required once the crisis was passed and the scaling-off process begins. Will you be so kind as to write me about it at once.
<br>With best greetings to your dear wife and Fränzchen.
<br>Yours<br>K Marx
<br>Liebknecht is growing more and more imbecile in his South-German stupidity. He is not enough of a dialectician to criticise both sides at the same time.

<p>TO MARX IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester,] [25]<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>September 1851</p>
<p>Dear Marx,</p>
<p>Your letter has arrived. Will write about Techow's erudition tomorrow. Kinkel's begging letter to New Orleans is very charming, but unfortunately I only saw the French version. Mr Stechan must also be in London by now; should he fail to announce himself, you will be absolutely right to leave the fellow to his own devices and to wait and see what happens before allowing anyone to take his side. Those released in Paris, of whom there is word in today's papers, will doubtless include Mr Conrad.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>I, too, was much annoyed by the stupidity of the German newspapers in laying Willich's document<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>at our door. However, it will soon transpire that we have nothing to do with this wretched screed. <i>Par dieu, nous en avons assez sur les bras</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>with other people's documents, as regards both style and content. Herewith article No. 3<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>for New York, at least a little less trashy than No. 2. I shall shortly be tackling No. 4.</p>
<p>You might from time to time send me an American paper <i>sous bande</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>it being occasionally desirable to see the muck <i>in natura</i>. I shall shortly be sending you another LOT OF STAMPS for this purpose.</p>
<p><i>Adieu!</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

(Marx and Engels called this organisation the Sonderbund by analogy with the separatist union of the Swiss Catholic cantons formed in the 1840s.) The appeal adopted at the congress of this organisation in the summer of 1851 was pervaded with adventuristic tendencies and voluntaristic-sectarian ideas of carrying out a revolution without any regard for objective conditions. In September 1851 the appeal fell into the hands of the police when they arrested members of local communities of this organisation in France (see Note 478). It was published in French papers under the heading: 'Instructions pour la Ligue, avant, pendant et après la révolution'. Excerpts were also published in the <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i>, No. 225, 19 September 1851.</span>

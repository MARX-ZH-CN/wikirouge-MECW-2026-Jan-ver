ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Eastbourne, 4 July 1886]</p>
<p>Dear Kautsky,</p>
<p>I would naturally prefer not to have any more visitors here, as Schorlemmer will in any case probably be arriving tomorrow; however, what has to be has to be. Besides, I shall be back in London on Wednesday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and hope that Mrs Guillaume-Schack will find enough to do in town until then. Since yesterday it has been oppressively hot here too, though all the same there has been a bit of a breeze — on Friday it was actually chilly and I couldn't sit outside in the evening without my overcoat. Best wishes to your wife. Pumps, Percy and Moore have taken a boat and gone out to catch fish for supper, provided, that is, <i>le bon dieu</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> doesn't object to their breaking the Sabbath and visit sea-serpents upon them. The Pilsener beer is also good here.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F.E.

ENGELS TO NATALIE LIEBKNECHT</p>
<p>IN BERLIN</p>
<p>London, 19 June 1890</p>
<p>Dear Mrs Liebknecht,</p>
<p>If I made a reference to your remarks about your being isolated and virtually ostracised in Leipzig, this was perfectly natural. From what you said I was bound to conclude that you found Leipzig insufferable and am glad to learn that such was by no means the case.</p>
<p>As to any other comparison between the merits of Leipzig and the drawbacks of Berlin, this is something I am really unable to discuss, as I don't know the former at all, while the latter are no more than a distant memory and since those days Berlin is said to have improved quite miraculously, or so the Berliners maintain. However I'm perfectly willing to believe you when you say that, from the point of view of family life, Leipzig has immeasurably more to offer than the metropolis of the Brandenburgian Sahara.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>All these, I have written to tell Singer and Liebknecht, are matters which everybody must thrash out with himself, his family and the party and in which we outsiders must acquiesce. However I can only say that I am also firmly of the opinion that Liebknecht's place is in Berlin if the party leadership and the party organ are transferred there. <i>Whether</i> or not that happens is not for me to say; I can only express an unauthoritative opinion. But <i>should</i> it happen and Liebknecht remain in Leipzig, he would, by so doing, lower himself to the status of a second-class party leader, pension himself off, so to speak, and find himself in a situation in which he could be neither consulted nor heard when an important problem arose—in short, it would be the first step towards resignation and you wouldn't want that.</p>
<p>People like us are tossed around by politics in a quite singular way. When in 1858 Lassalle wanted to bring out a paper with Marx and myself in Berlin, we couldn't actually say no and were prepared to move to the sandy metropolis—fortunately negotiations broke down.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>And for me that would have meant terminating my contracts with the firm<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>and for us both a removal with much more far-reaching consequences than those of a transition from Leipzig to Berlin. If, therefore, circumstances arise which make your removal to the imperial sand-box unavoidable, you can certainly draw comfort, not only from the belated discovery that life there is bearable after all, but also from the certain knowledge that Liebknecht is thereby assuming the position in the party that is his by right and that he has come to the place where he can do full justice to his position.</p>
<p>At all events this business will be decided before very long and it is my hope that, whatever that decision may be, you will in the long run become reconciled to it.</p>
<p>Kindest regards from Nim, Mme Lafargue, the Roshers and</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>F. Engels

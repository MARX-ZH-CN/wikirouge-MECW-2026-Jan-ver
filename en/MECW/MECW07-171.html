<p>No. 201 of the Breslauer Zeitung publishes a report from Berlin that knight Schnapphahnski<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>has bought many shares in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung and for this reason the series of feature articles about him has come to an end, because it is not possible for a newspaper to wage a polemic against its own shareholders. The allegedly democratic Düsseldorfer Zeitung considers itself bound to reproduce this insinuation in its columns. Whatever concoctions it may be desired to invent in Berlin, a Silesian newspaper ought to have known that this assertion was a lie and why it was a lie. Unfortunately for it, however, the treacherous assertion comes too late. No. 92 of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, which was published long before the arrival of No. 201 of the Breslauer Zeitung, contains the continuation of the feature articles in question. Moreover, the Neue Rheinische Zeitung is the newspaper of a party and has already given sufficient proof that it is not to be bought.</p>

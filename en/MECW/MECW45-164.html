ENGELS TO B. LINDHEIMER</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London,] 21 April 1877</p>
<p><i>To Mr B. Lindheimer</i></p>
<p>The last time you came and saw me, I categorically told you that I could not let you have more than the £ 1 1 had advanced you, and you yourself declared that this went without saying. I am all the less prepared to go back on this in that, according to your own story, you could at any time obtain money from your friends in the CITY, were it not for your reluctance to approach them to this effect. But if the position be viewed in its proper perspective, it cannot possibly be harder for you to approach these friends of yours, who know you and your circumstances and to whom you were recommended, than myself who is as much a stranger to you as you are to me. In any case, I cannot spare you this step,</p>
<p>having already more than enough to do lending an occasional helping hand to party comrades who have no one in the CITY from whom they might obtain advances, and I would ask you politely but unequivocally to regard this as <i>my final word.</i> I am, Sir, etc.</p>
<p>E.

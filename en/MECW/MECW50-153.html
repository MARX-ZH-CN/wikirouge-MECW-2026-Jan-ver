ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY</p>
<p>IN STUTTGART</p>
<p>[Eastbourne], 13 February 1894</p>
<p>Dear Baron,</p>
<p>Am back in Eastbourne 333 again because of my usual lame leg, but it's already on the mend. Shall remain here until at least the 23rd of this month; if you should write, the address will be 28, Marine Parade, Eastbourne. Victor has snatched the <i>Critica Sociale</i> article away from under your nose and is translating it. 334 At the moment I've got no time at all since I am having to proof correct the whole of the rest of Volume III<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>and page proofs rain down on me as inexorably as blows in the Cameroons. 335</p>
<p>Ask Dietz to send the 8 marks with the next larger consignment to Vienna.</p>
<p>282</p>
<p>I do not consider the term 'communism' suitable for <i>general</i> use today; rather it should be reserved for cases in which a <i>more exact</i> description is required, and even then it would call for an explanatory note, having virtually fallen out of use for the past thirty years. 336</p>
<p>At the moment I consider Burns to be better and Jaurès to be less important than commonly made out to be.</p>
<p>Warm regards from one household to the other.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F.E.

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>London, 23 January 1869</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>We all hope that things are better at 86 Mornington STREET. Scarlet fever is apparently raging throughout England. But perhaps G u m p e r t has m a d e a mistake with Mary Ellen.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> TUSSY SENDS HER BEST COMPLIMENTS TO HER AND MRS BURNS.</p>
<p>Here there is a preponderance of coughs a n d colds. In my case, things were so bad that, for nearly 2 weeks, I was 'puking' regularly, to use the elegant language of Frau Blind. I went out again yesterday for the first time, and today I am smoking A CIGAR <i>as a test.</i></p>
<p>The enclosed photogram is sent to you by Jennychen, who is also coughing nastily. She asks for the return of Büchner,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> since she has studied Darwin<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> and now wishes to get acquainted with the great Büchner. The cross (on the photogram of Jenny) is the Polish 1864 Insurrection Cross.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Tussy has taken over sending receipts for the wine, and believes that to date she has done so.</p>
<p>Enclosed are 2 Borkheimiana. So that he can deposit his 'super intellect' somewhere, and not buzz my ears full, I have recom- mended that he write 'Russian Letters' for <i>Zukunft.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> <i>Nous verrons.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>I have seen from <i>The Money Market Review</i> that Knowles is paying 7s.6d. in the £.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> How is the old boy doing?</p>
<p>With best greetings to the whole household.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Moor

They appeared in <i>Die Zukunft</i> in January-August and November of 1869 and in February and March of 1870. In a letter TO ENGELS of 19 January 1869, Borkheim asked him to recommend books for use in his work on the articles.</span>

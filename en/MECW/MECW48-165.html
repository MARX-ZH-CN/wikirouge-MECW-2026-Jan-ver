ENGELS TO JOHN LINCOLN MAHON<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London], 14 February 1889</p>
<p>As far as I know G. J. Harney is still in England. Will let you know posi- tively as soon as I can, will try to write to him and ascertain his where- abouts at once. If I can be of any use to Mr. Atherley Jones,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> shall be glad to see him, am at home almost every evening.</p>
<p>Have not yet had the time to study your programme<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> sufficiently to give an opinion. I am very much debarred from reading by gas by medical orders.</p>
<p>Yours truly</p>
<p>F. Engels

On 14 June Engels received a copy of the programme from Mahon with the request to comment on it. Engels sent his suggestions concerning the introductory part of the programme (see present edition, Vol. 26). They were not put into effect since the Federation only lasted a few months.</span>

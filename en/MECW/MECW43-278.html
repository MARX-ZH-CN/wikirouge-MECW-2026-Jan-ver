ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 9 January 1870</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>A Happy New Year! I arrived back here at midday on Thursday, after thoroughly wrecking my stomach in Barmen with innumerable guzzlings.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The people there are overjoyed, that is, the philistines are. The danger of war has now been finally overcome; Louis-Napoleon has once again finely maintained his superior wisdom through prudent compliance.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Bismarck is once again able to work, confidence is returning, COMMERCE <i>must</i> improve, and so 1870 must be an extremely blessed year for the honest German duffers. I cannot grasp how these people manage to take leave of more of their senses every year.</p>
<p>Hühnerbein, the old tailor and general of the revolution, was very pleased to see me. He still has a complete set of the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> bound in red, which is good to know. He sends greetings; he has two very pretty daughters.</p>
<p>I did not go to Solingen<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. It would have been very difficult for me to get away for a day at HOLIDAY time;</p>
<p>2. I could not very well have asked for a closer look at the business without contributing a larger sum myself, which was not possible and</p>
<p>3. as a Party friend, I would have been forced to take the people's word for some things, and not to have insisted so strictly, like a <i>complete stranger,</i> on the presentation of all documents and SECURITIES; and Menke, as a result of <i>my</i> report, would perhaps refrain from sending anyone, and thus load me with a responsibil- ity I would prefer to decline.</p>
<p>Now I shall wait for your reply and then wiite to the people.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>If I hadn't been so wrecked and, in addition, worried about Lizzie, whom I left unwell, and from whom I heard nothing all the time, I would have dropped in on you on the return journey.</p>
<p>Read practically no newspapers the whole time, but I see that the Hatzfeldt, through Mende, has laid an interdict on Schweitzer<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> ; things must be all over for Schweitzer soon. I shall presumably get details through you from the papers.</p>
<p>In Cologne I visited Klein<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> for a few moments. Was very cool; these people become so philistinised that we appear to really bother them. They now have an anti-ultramontane association, naturally including Cherethites and Pelethites<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> (which means Cretans and Philistines according to Ewald's translation).</p>
<p>Best greetings.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

In 1872, it virtually ceased to exist.</span>

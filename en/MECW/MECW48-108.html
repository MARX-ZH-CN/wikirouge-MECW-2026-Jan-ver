ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT</p>
<p>IN BORSDORF NEAR LEIPZIG</p>
<p>London, about 29 April 1888</p>
<p>Dear Liebknecht,</p>
<p>Enclosed received this morning.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>It's just as well that Fritz<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> is a bit better. If young William<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> comes to the throne at this particular juncture, he and Bismarck—unless all the indications are deceptive—will compound with Russia so as to secure her permission for a war with France. It would seem that certain contin- gent agreements have already been concluded. In this way, and only in this way, would Boulanger constitute a danger, to France no less than to Germany. The French would be beaten, but because their fortifications are so strong, the war would be a protracted one and other people would join in. Probably Austria and Italy <i>against</i> Germany, since Russia's permission for something like this could not be obtained without both being sacrificed to the Russians. So that means that Bismarck will help the Russians to take Constantinople, and that means a world war on terms that will <i>quite certainly</i> ensure our eventual defeat—in alliance with Russia against the world! I trust this danger will pass.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F.E.

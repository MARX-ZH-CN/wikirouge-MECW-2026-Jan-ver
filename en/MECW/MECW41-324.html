ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 3 June 1864</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>I beg to confirm my last<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>and today would humbly inform you that Lupus's will passed through the COURT OF PROBATE<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>the day before yesterday and that I have taken possession of the document in question. I have also shown it to the bank and had it registered there, and on Monday or Tuesday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>shall draw the money from the bank (I can do this on my own without Borchardt) and remit it to you. There is about £230. I shall try and see B. tomorrow or on Monday and shall then do all I can to get the matter speedily wound up. The approximate amount of estate duty—£12<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>—will be retained by me up here plus a bit extra for the LAWYER'S bill, etc. The latter tells me that to safeguard oneself against any possibility of future claims one should, about 1 month after PROBATE (i.e., as from 1 July), insert 3 successive notices in the <i>Gazette,</i> <i>Times</i> and LOCAL PAPERS, addressed to undeclared creditors and limiting the period of liability. This means the final settlement will be somewhat further delayed. The demand for payment of duty will be made in September or thereabouts (so until then interest on the amount in question will be recoverable), after which we shall have to deal with Wood's account and pay over the money; it will then be possible to dispose of the matter finally.</p>
<p>I have discovered the chap to whom Lupus went to be photographed and who has the original negative. I have had 24 prints done, 4 of which I enclose; you might give one each to Pfänder and Eccarius, and if you want any more they are yours for the asking. I took this opportunity of having another one taken of myself, the result of which you will find enclosed; people here say it is very good.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Free Press</i> received with thanks. What will POOR Collet set his hand to, now that Othello's OCCUPATION is GONE? And that poor, clever boy<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>who is party to all the secrets of highest diplomacy?</p>
<p>Many regards. How goes it with the furuncles?</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>British Museum [London,] 29 March 1858</p>
<p>DEAR Frederic,</p>
<p>T h e £ 5 most gratefully received. Today a letter from Lassalle.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Duncker is prepared to publish my political economy on the following conditions. Every few months I am to supply instalments of 3 to 6 sheets (this was my suggestion). He is to have the right to cancel the arrangement at the third instalment. Indeed, no contract is to be definitely concluded until then. In the meantime he is to pay 3 fried- richsdors per sheet. (According to Lassalle, professors in Berlin get only 2) T h e first instalment<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> is to be READY at the end of May, i. e. the manuscript.</p>
<p><i>In my next</i> I must let you have an outline of the first instalment so that you can tell me what you think of it. For the past two weeks I have again been VERY SICKLY and have been taking medicine for my liver. I have been much subject to relapses of late owing to prolonged work by night and, by day, a multitude of petty annoyances RESULTING FROM THE ECONOMICAL CONDITIONS OF MY DOMESTICITY.</p>
<p>I hope that you are quite well again. Write to me about this</p>
<p>POINT.</p>
<p>Have had a letter from Harney today, returning my wife's letter to Schramm, which is nice. T h e litde man seems annoyed at my failure to write. He no longer addresses me as DEAR M. but as Dr M. WELL. Maybe I shall send him 4 lines or so, TO CONSOLE THE LOUSY</p>
<p>LITTLE FELLOW.</p>
<p>In France, the dance is proceeding most satisfactorily. Condi- tions are very unlikely to remain peaceful throughout the summer. What d o you think of the 5 pashaliks?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Originally it was intended to make Pélissier their supreme CHIEF. But on closer consideration Bonaparte decided THAT THIS WOULD BE IN FACT AN ABDICATION OF POWER ON HIS PART. So it's only a half-measure, and one whereby the Spanish institution of CAPTAIN-GENERALSHIP<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> has been introduced into France lock, stock and barrel. Now doesn't this imply a collapse of centralisation and, IN FACT, a diminution of the power of the army? W E MUST HOPE that the French business won't take a SPANISH TURN, but rather that this decentralisation will merely reduce the resistance to be encountered by the revolution.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i>.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>Have you ATTENDED [noticed] that of late most of the French companies set u p on the pattern of the Crédit mobilier 4 5 have appeared before the <i>tribunal criminel?</i>

Marx calls these districts  <i>pashaliks</i> (a comparison earlier used by the French republican press), to  emphasise the similarity of the unlimited powers of the reactionary Marshals  and the despotic power of the Turkish pashas.—296</span>

ENGELS TO CESARE BERT<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN TURIN</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>London, 21 March 1872</p>
<p>Citizen Carlo Bert,</p>
<p>I have received your address from Citizen Et. Péchard, who was passing through Turin at the end of February, and also the information that you are now the secretary of our section <i>Emancipation of the Proletarian,</i> instead of C. Terzaghi, who was expelled for embezzlement, etc. It will therefore now be my pleasant duty to correspond with you.</p>
<p>I have just received a long letter from Terzaghi<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>saying that he resigned as secretary and member of the <i>Emancipation of the Proletarian</i> because this society is made up in part of government agents and Mazzinians, and that this society wanted to pass a vote of no confidence in him because he was preaching <i>war on capital</i></p>
<p>Naturally, we here are much more inclined to believe what you and the other members of your Council told Péchard than what I hear from Terzaghi, who has always played all sorts of tricks on us. But in order to be able to act confidently and decisively and to fulfil our responsibility at the next Congress, we should like you to send us an official letter from your Council, setting out the charges against Terzaghi and letting us know the resolutions passed by your society concerning him. In no way can we have two rival, warring sections in the same town. Fortunately, the Administrative Regulations (Resolutions of the Basle Congress) give the General Council the right to admit or reject any new section.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>You yourself see how necessary it is for our organisation to possess a right which Terzaghi's Jurassian friends wanted you to believe was authoritarian and unjustifiable.</p>
<p>Please reply as quickly as possible. A fraternal handshake.</p>
<p>Yours
</p>

In the second half of February 1872, on the instructions of the General Council, Regis (under the pseudonym of Etienne Pechard) spent ten days in Milan and Turin, where, acting on Engels' instructions, he was to acquaint himself with the actual state of affairs in the International's sections.<br>Regis described his trip in a letter to Engels of 1 March; he wrote about Carlo Terzaghi's expulsion from the Turin section of the International—the Emancipation of the Proletarian society — and his suspicions of Terzaghi's contacts with the police. This information prompted Engels to demand that Terzaghi explain his behaviour (see this volume, p. 352).<br>The original is mistakenly addressed to Carlo Bert and not Cesare Bert. Engels wrote across the letter: 'London, 21 March 1872. To C. Bert, Turin.'</span>

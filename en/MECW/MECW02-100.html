<p>Dear Marie,</p>
<p>Mother says I didn't write you a letter last time, only a mere scrawl which was not worth answering, and since you have not replied to it, I am almost forced to believe, to my very great sorrow, that you agree with her. Still, I must tell you that I am very hurt, not to say insulted, by such treatment and I am writing to you tonight only because I am in a good mood and have no wish to start quarrelling with you, for you certainly don't deserve a letter. Apart from which I am doing Mother a favour, so now you know whom you have to thank for these lines. I have now been here about six weeks, have smoked a great deal of tobacco and have studied hard although there are some in the higher regions who maintain that I have been doing nothing. However, I shall be leaving for Berlin in a week or a fortnight to do my duty as a citizen, i. e., to do what I can to evade conscription <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> if possible and then come back to Barmen. We shall have to wait and see how this turns out.</p>
<p>We had arranged a trip to Altenberg for Saturday and Sunday but nothing will come of it because Blank and Roth cannot manage it. I must see whether we can organise something else. It has just occurred to me that I might go to the Beienburg again, as I have not been there for a long time.</p>
<p>Mother went to August's [Engels' uncle] for coffee yesterday and noticed that Fräulein Julie Engels was very quiet but Fräulein Mathilde Wemhöner was very talkative. You can draw your own conclusions from this.</p>
<p>Apart from this I have found Anna very jolly, Emil making progress as a humorist, Hedwig becoming very cheeky and Rudolf going the same awkward way as Hermann' did at his age, and, for the rest, that Elise gives herself airs.</p>
<p>The letter you wrote to Father in English, which I have read today, is good on the whole, with only a few serious mistakes.</p>
<p><em>Du rests</em></p>
<p>Your brother <em>Friedrich</em></p>
<p>Barmen, Sept. 9, 41

Engels' subsequent letters to Marie were sent from Berlin, where he arrived in the latter half of September 1841.</span>

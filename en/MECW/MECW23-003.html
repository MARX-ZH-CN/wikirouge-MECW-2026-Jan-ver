<blockquote>
<p>The question of <a class="external text" href="https://maitron.fr/spip.php?article58444" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Gustave Durand</a> was considered at a special meeting of the General Council on October 7, 1871, at which Durand's correspondence with the French police officers was produced. Durand was instructed to participate in the London Conference of the International with espionage as an ulterior motive and also to become a member of the General Council. The resolution on Durand's expulsion was drawn up and submitted to the meeting by Engels. He also translated it into French and Italian.

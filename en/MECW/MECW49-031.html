ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN<sup>0</sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 20 October [1890]</p>
<p>Tussy arrived home yesterday morning. Adler<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> had told her that Louise Kautsky had come back from Berchtesgaden in the best of spirits, was looking 10 years younger and proving a tremendous success. Tussy was very full of the congress 12; the masses, she said, were first-rate but the parliamentary group for the most part still philistine — Bebel had been greatly alarmed upon hearing of the electoral victories of certain of their number and had at once written to say that, while the damage had already been done, it must not be allowed to happen again. Provided this gang follows Bebel's lead, things will still be all right.</p>

<p>I am sending what remains of the reports, amongst them a Hamburg paper, as I don't know whether you have already got the Berlin report about the 14th of October.

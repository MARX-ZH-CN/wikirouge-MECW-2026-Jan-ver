<p><i>To Engels In Brussels</i>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the end of February 1848 a revolution took place in France which was enthusiastically welcomed in Belgium. Alarmed by the scope of the democratic movement in the country, the Belgian authorities resorted to arrests and expulsion of German revolutionary emigrants. They arrested the Communist League members Wilhelm Wolff and Victor Tedesco. On 3 March Marx was ordered to leave Belgium in twenty-four hours. However, in the night of 3 March, when he was preparing to leave, the police burst into Marx's flat, arrested him and then his wife. After 18 hours of imprisonment Marx and his family were forced to leave Belgium at once. On the invitation of Flocon, who had been elected member of the Provisional Government of the French Republic, Marx moved to Paris.</p>
<p>Engels, expelled from Paris at the end of January 1848 for his revolutionary activity, was in Brussels from 31 January.</p>
<p>The time of writing of this letter, as well as of many other undated ones, is established on the basis of the chronology of events mentioned, in particular the constitution of the new Central Authority of the Communist League on 7 March 1848, and of Jones' departure for England, where he arrived not later than 12 March, etc.</p>
<p>An excerpt from this letter was published in English for the first time in <i>Labour Monthly</i>, 1948, No. 3, III.

<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Get Breyer to pay you the <em>100 francs</em> which he solemnly promised me to repay within a week, get <em>30</em> from Gigot, <em>10</em> from Hess. I hope that, as things are now, Breyer will keep his promise.</p>
<p>Maynz will cash the bill for 114 fr. at Cassel's and give you the money. Collect these various sums and use them.</p>
<p>They spoke kindly of you at the <em>Réforme</em>. Flocon is ill and I haven't yet seen him. The rumour spread by Seiler is circulating among the Germans generally. Allard has not yet been ousted by the revolution. I advise you to come here.</p>
<p>Central Authority has been constituted here,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> since Jones, Harney, Schapper, Bauer and Moll are all on the spot. I have been nominated chairman and Schapper secretary. Members are: Wallau, Lupus, Moll, Bauer and Engels.</p>
<p>Jones left for England yesterday; Harney is ill. Salut.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The Second Congress of the Communist League retained the seat of the Central Authority in London. However, as a revolution had broken out in France, Schapper, Bauer, Moll and other members of the London Central Authority intended to move to the Continent and decided to transfer their powers of general direction of the League to the Brussels District Committee headed by Marx. But the persecution of revolutionaries by the Belgian authorities impelled the Brussels Central Authority that had been formed to adopt on 3 March 1848 a decision to dissolve itself and to empower Marx to form a new Central Authority in Paris. Marx arrived in Paris on 5 March and took up this appointment. On 7 March the Paris Central Authority mentioned by Marx was formed. Engels was elected in his absence.</span>

[Manchester,] 27 June 1851</p>
<p>Dear Marx,</p>
<p>It is very <i>bonasse</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> of the good Saxon police actually to inform us themselves of what we did not previously know or could not have discovered. Burgers' didactically dignified circular letter with the familiar <i>clair-obscur</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> of its reasoning must have cost them much fruitless brain-racking<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> ; they even picked out all the wrong passages for printing in bold. A pretty figure the great Windmillers<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> cut now, thrown out of their own party before the eyes of the whole world, the great Willich bracketed with Haude, Gebert and other such unknown rabble, with a certain 'Schopper' (derived from 'Schoppen')<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> whose rare services are so little known that even in <i>Cologne</i> they can't print his name correctly! So FAR ALL RIGHT. But Article I of the Rules bodes ill for the arrested men: 'all methods of revolutionary activity', or however it goes.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> It removes the business from the sphere of mere prohibited association to that of high treason. To judge, by the way, from an allusion in the <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i>, I would seem to be right in supposing that the intention is to arraign the whole company in Berlin before the State tribunal which is to be brought into being specifically for this grandiose occasion.</p>
<p>The utter failure of the government's attempt to make a bogy out of the great Dresden disclosure augurs well for the mood of the bourgeoisie. So little terror does the red spectre now hold for the bourgeois that he refuses to listen to talk of a big communist plot and is already beginning to fear that the system of house searches will ere long be extended to himself.</p>
<p>Not a single paper has taken the bait and the government's frantic endeavour to discover further machinations in gymnastic societies, 'free communities'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> and among democratically-minded master tailors proves, on the one hand, how much it is vexed by the indifference of the bourgeoisie whose curiosity it is seeking to whet, and, on the other, how little the Rules and the circular letter have led to further disclosures. It would seem that Miquel's house also was searched in vain.</p>
<p><i>Qu'y a-t-il de nouveau a Londres?</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

On the whole, the authors of the Address, especially Bürgers, supported Marx and Engels in their condemnation of the splitting activities of the Willich-Schapper group. They stated in the Address that the Cologne Central Authority was expelling from the League all the members of the separatist union set up by Willich and Schapper. However, instead of disclosing the real causes of the split in the League, the Address put the blame partially on Marx and his followers. Some propositions set forth in the Address were vague and obscure.</span>

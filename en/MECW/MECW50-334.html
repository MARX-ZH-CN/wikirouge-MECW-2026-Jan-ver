<p>CODICIL OF 26 JULY 1895
</p>
</center><p>I Frederick Engels of 41 Regent's Park Road London formerly of 122 Regent's Park Road aforesaid declare this to be a first Codicil which I make this 26th day of July 1895 to my Will which is dated the 29th day of July 1893. 1 revoke the bequest made in my said Will of the sum of £3,000 to my Niece Mary Ellen Rosher the Wife of Percy White Rosher and in lieu thereof I bequeath to her the sum of £2,230. And I also bequeath to her the Reversionary Interest of the said Percy White Rosher in certain monies to which he is or was entitled expectant on the death of his parents under their Marriage Settlement which said Reversionary Interest I have bought from him for the sum of £240 and which also cost me £30 for legal expenses making £270 in all. I direct that all money payments made by me without receiving a consideration for the same to Percy White Rosher, Mary Ellen Rosher his Wife, Paul Lafargue, Laura Lafargue his Wife, Doctor Edward Aveling, Eleanor Marx his Wife, Eugene Oswald and Frederick Lessner or to any of them shall be considered as free gifts to them respectively. And I bequeath the same accordingly. I bequeath to Doctor Ludwig Freyberger of 41 Regent's Park Road London as an acknowledgment and in consideration of the unremitting care with which he has for years professionally attended me without ever accepting any remuneration the sum of £80 for every complete year elapsed from the 1st day of July 1893 down to the date of my death and also the sum of £50 for the fraction of a year however small which may have elapsed from the 1st day of July preceding my death down to the day of my death and I make this bequest conditional on his making no claim against me or my Estate for his professional Services.</p>
<p>I empower and direct my Executors before they dispose in open market of the Lease of my house No. 41 Regent's Park Road aforesaid to give to Louise Freyberger referred to in my said Will as Louise Kautsky and who is now the Wife of the said Doctor Freyberger the option of taking an assignment of the said Lease subject to the payment of the rent and the performance of the Covenants therein, she indemnifying my Estate and Executors against all claims by the Lessor under the said Lease the said option to be exercised by Notice in writing to any of my Executors other than the said Louise Freyberger within one month of my death. Whereas by my said Will I have directed that all family letters written by or addressed to Karl Marx which shall be in my possession or control at the time of my death shall be given by my Executors to Eleanor Marx Aveling, now I hereby revoke the said direction as to family letters, and in lieu, thereof I direct that all letters written by or addressed to the said Karl Marx (except my letters to him and his letters to me) which shall be, in my possession or control at the time of my death shall be given by my Executors to the said Eleanor Marx Aveling who is the legal personal Representative of the said Karl Marx and I further direct by this Codicil that all letters in my possession at the time of my death written by my relatives in Barmen and Engelskirchen by Percy W. Rosher or Ellen his Wife, by Paul Lafargue or Laura his Wife, by Doctor Edward Aveling or Eleanor Marx his Wife, by Doctor Ludwig Freyberger or Louise his Wife and by the Beust family in Zurich be returned by my Executors to the respective writers thereof and accordingly I hereby revoke the bequest in my said Will to August Bebel and Edward Bernstein of all letters (except the said family letters of Karl Marx) and in lieu thereof I bequeath to the said August Bebel and Edward Bernstein all letters (except those directed to be given by this Codicil to the said Eleanor Marx Aveling and except those otherwise disposed of by this Codicil). And subject as aforesaid I confirm my said Will. In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand the day and year first above written.</p>

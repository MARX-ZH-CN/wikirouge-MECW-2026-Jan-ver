ENGELS TO JOHANN PHILIPP BECKER
<br>IN GENEVA
<br>London, 9 August 1882
<br>Dear Old Man,
<br>I had no opportunity yesterday of taking out a money order for you. But I did so first thing today and you will be paid <i>£5</i> sterling over there, which, according to the table, equals 126 frs. I was very glad to get another letter from you and hear how you are getting on. I, too, would give I don't know how much if you, Marx and I could foregather once more, but this year it's unlikely I shall have any such luck. There might still be a chance of your seeing Marx this summer, but that depends on where the doctors send him. I shall have to postpone the rest of my reply for a day or two as it's nearly time for the post and I still have to write at some length to Bernstein about this and that.
<br>In the meantime keep yourself hale and hearty as always. Kindest regards.
<br>Your old friend
<br>F. Engels

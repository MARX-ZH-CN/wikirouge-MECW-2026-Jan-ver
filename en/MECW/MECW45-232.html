ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Littlehampton, 4 1 9<br>18 September 1878<br>
Selborne Cottage</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>As usual I did not express myself clearly. Since I couldn't expect you to go over daily and forward me my letters, I sent the people at home a few addressed envelopes so that they might forward me the letters every two or three days. What I had meant to ask you to do was to make sure, during the first few days, that the letter concerning money I was expecting wasn't left lying around for a number of days, and that the general business of sending stuff became a regular routine; also to take an occasional look at the newspapers and other papers that had arrived (and were, according to my instructions, to remain there) in case they should include anything that called for attention. I hope we now understand one another.</p>
<p><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>This morning's <i>Standard</i> contains a good article full of well-merited contempt on the subject of the law and the debate.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>I am sending it to Leipzig.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> The debate is deplorable enough as far as the law-and-order men are concerned. Bismarck, totally incapable of refuting the facts adduced against him by Bebel,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>has recourse to the pitiful subterfuge of saying that he sympathised with the Social-Democrats until they began extolling the Commune—he, who himself patted the Commune on the back for copying Prussia's municipal statutes! And then he reviles as a band of robbers a party represented in the Reichstag, and the call to order is rejected!</p>
<p>I am sending you a <i>Kölnische Zeitung.</i> First there is a demand for <i>Russian laws</i> for the <i>Germans,</i> and then the Petersburg correspondent says that since in <i>Russia those same Russian laws</i> have proved ineffective, the only remedy lies in a constitution, popular representation, freedom of the press, etc.! The stupid paper failed to notice this, as no doubt did our people too, alas. The <i>last part</i> of the piece from Moscow is also interesting. Mark the things and send them to Leipzig (Ramm—Hermann—Färberstraße 12<sup>IIb</sup>); they might notice it after all and make use of it.</p>
<p>Russia's numerous and forceful moves in Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan, etc., would seem to be intended on the one hand TO FISH IN TROUBLED WATERS, WHERE SOMETHING MAY BE EXPECTED TO TURN UP AT ANY MOMENT and, on the other, to deceive public opinion at home. But who knows what may yet come of it? Bismarck may soon be so placed that his only recourse will be to seek another war with France, thus sparking off a European war of East versus West, in the course of which no one is more likely to go under than he. At all events, the Turkish war has shown how rotten the whole of Europe is, and that the eruption is closer than we might have expected. No matter what happens, it will turn out to our advantage.</p>
<p>I was delighted to hear that the little boy<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> is better, which means that with any luck the perpetual alarms are now a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Here it has been raining incessantly since yesterday evening. This little place consists of two parts—the VILLAGE and harbour on the River Arne, and the BEACH 500 paces to the south-east, some 150 houses on a dune, where one might well imagine oneself in Holland. SANDS as lovely and firm as at Ostend.</p>
<p>I may spend a couple of hours in London at the end of this week; IF SO I shall, if possible, let you know.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">On 18 September 1878, <i>The Standard,</i> No. 16897, carried an article covering the debate on the Anti-Socialist Bill that had begun in the Reichstag on 16 September. Further on, Engels is referring to the telegraphic communication in the same issue of the newspaper: 'The German Parliament. The Anti-Socialist Bill. Speech of Prince Bismarck' dealing with the Reichstag sitting of 17 September.</span>

<li id="cite_note-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-3">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">On 27 September 1878, the <i>Vorwärts,</i> No. 114 (the 'Aus England, London, 20. September' section) featured extracts from a number of British newspapers dealing with the Anti-Socialist Bill. <i>The Standard</i> was not mentioned in the review.</span>

<li id="cite_note-4"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-4">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">In his speech to the Reichstag on 16 September 1878, August Bebel refuted the groundless accusations against the Social-Democrats which had given Bismarck a pretext to introduce the Anti-Socialist Bill. He noted that time would show its pointlessness, since the Social-Democrats would be able to disseminate their ideas even working underground.</span>

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>London, 22 May 1854 28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>It was a good thing you didn't come on Saturday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>My trouble—now a fortnight old—had come to a head. I could hardly speak and even laughing hurt because of a great festering boil between my nose and mouth, which this morning has at least dwindled to quite reasonable dimensions. My lips, too, which were tremendously swollen, are approximately back to normal again, etc., in short, everything indicates that I shall soon be well again. It's truly devilish, having such a wretched head for a whole fortnight. Beyond a joke. For the past week I've had to give up reading and smoking altogether and today am waiting to see if Freund will allow me to try a cigar.</p>
<p>To compound the misery, all three children<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>have been down with measles since last Friday (Thursday night), which means that the house has become a veritable hospital.</p>
<p>Herewith Cluss. Collapse of the <i>Reform</i> deplorable.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>

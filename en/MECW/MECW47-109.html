ENGELS TO MARYA JANKOWSKA (S. LEONOWICZ)</p>
<p>IN GENEVA</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[Worthing, mid-August 1884]</p>
<p>Yes. The only condition I must impose on you — and this categorical- ly— is that you should publish <i>nothing</i> in Polish before the German edition has been completed. The work would be instantly banned in Germany and the least indiscretion or premature allusion could only result in alerting the German police and in hampering the circulation of the original, if not in causing a large part of the edition to be confis- cated. Perhaps you would be so kind, then, as to acknowledge receipt of this letter and to give me your assurance that you will abide by a condition which, unfortunately, cannot be dispensed with.

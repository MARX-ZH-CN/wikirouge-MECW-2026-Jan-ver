To Engels in Manchester</p>
<p>[London,] 15 December 1854<br>
28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>I have just received your note and very much look forward to seeing you here in a week's time.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Article received.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Barthélemy's end is a GLORIOUS one.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> At yesterday's hearing (or rather CORONERS INQUEST) it was said that important papers, though not relating to the assassination, had been found on him.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> It would be annoying if these included papers from the old days, so that we seemed to be connected with a fellow who—or so the louts boasted—was 'saving up' a bullet for us in the event of our returning to Paris.</p>
<p>I haven't read the Bauer, so bring it with you.</p>
<p>Next week I start writing for the Neue Oder-Zeitung. 30 talers a month for the time being. I suppose, however, that the fellows will be satisfied with three articles a week. Not having the money to buy books, I cannot possibly bid adieu to my studies at the Museum<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> in return for 30 talers a month. Much though I dislike the thing, I've accepted it for the sake of my wife's peace of mind. Her PROSPECTS, of course, are GLOOMY.</p>
<p>What I particularly approved of in Ripley<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> was his not giving way to enthusiastic hyperbole. The strategic mistakes made in the Mexican War would seem to be self-explanatory in view of the total absence of plan. As for the nicer tactical blunders, I, OF COURSE, understand nothing of such matters. I should think that he took Napier<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> for his model, to judge by the way he depicts the Mexicans just as Napier does the Spaniards, and in the second place strives after FAIRNESS towards the opponents.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I shall be saddled with Blind and wife. This 'shinishter' Russophobe and 'repelbican' still insists that Baden is the real land of the future.</p>
<p>Salut. And give my regards to Lupus.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

Pointing to this aspect of Herzen's activity, Lenin wrote in his article 'In Memory of Herzen' that he 'was the first to raise the great banner of struggle by addressing his free Russian word to the masses' (V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 18, p. 31). Nikolai Ogarev, another prominent figure among the Russian revolutionary democrats, also took part in the management of the Free Russian Press. Besides a large number of books, pamphlets and leaflets, the Free Russian Press published the periodicals Полярная Звезда (The Polar Star) and Колокол (The Bell), which played a great part in developing the revolutionary and democratic movement in Russia. In April 1865 the Free Russian Press was moved to Geneva, where it continued functioning up to August 1867</span>

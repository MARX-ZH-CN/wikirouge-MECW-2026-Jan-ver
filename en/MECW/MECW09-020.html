<p>There is little to add to the reports published this morning. The reports on the battle at Szolnok are extremely vague; but it seems that the Karger imperial brigade stationed there was attacked by the Magyars from the rear at Abony and driven to the opposite (left) bank of the Theiss, which is wholly in Magyar hands. If this is so, the brigade is lost and not a man can escape being killed or taken prisoner. Three battalions were sent from Pest to Abony; but they were too late, of course. Just as they were leaving by train; the defeated General Zeisberg arrived in Pest from Szolnok. He had to go by carriage as far as Abony, since the railway was already destroyed.</p>
<p>In Budapest new fortifications are being erected.
</p>
<blockquote><p>"The blockhouses at the two bridgeheads of the suspension bridge," writes the <i>Constitutionelles Blatt aus Böhmen,</i> "should be completed shortly and offer a firm bulwark against attacks, not easy to take.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"In spite of the announcement that there can be no question of calling in or confiscating Hungarian notes in private circulation in Hungary, there is a heavy surcharge on the purchase of Austrian banknotes with Hungarian paper money, and the latter's rate of exchange is likely to fall day by day, since the merchants here have to make many more payments of considerable sums to the other patrimonial dominions, in particular to Vienna, than they will be receiving from there. The Israelites of the capital have been given renewed orders to pay the instalments on the notorious arrears of the toleration-tax redemption in silver pieces of twenty, but the community has been granted an extension of a fortnight, or of 18 days, according to another report."</p></blockquote>
<p>From the comitat of <i>Tolna</i> we learn from the same paper:
</p>
<blockquote><p>"The Tolna county is again in <i>full rebellion,</i> despite its declarations of allegiance. The speeches which Moriz Perczel recently made at public meetings there sowed bad seed, and the military authority was informed too late when he stayed incognito at his father's baronial estate a few days ago. Only his carriage and his innocent valet fell into the hands of the imperial troops."</p></blockquote>
<p>Nor do things look too brilliant for the imperial arms in the south. Let us quote once more the <i>Constitutionelles Blatt aus Böhmen:</i>
</p>
<blockquote><p>"As regards the capture of Alt-Arad a considerable snag has been encountered. General Todorovich wanted to leave his whole corps behind as garrison, but some of the officers regarded three battalions as sufficient for the purpose. So it happened that, when the main body of the Serbs moved into their camp, the defeated Magyars returned across the Maros, and as a result two battalions were driven out and one was partly captured, partly cut down."</p></blockquote>
<p>When the imperial troops took Esseg, they expected that the garrison would rush to join the imperial army, but of the four companies of former regular troops of the imperial army <i>not one man</i> and of all the Honveds<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> only <i>16 men</i> were recruited.</p>
<p>The following news comes from Croatia, on which "independence" has been imposed. The <i>Agramer Zeitung</i> writes:
</p>
<blockquote><p>"We hear from a reliable source that the Ministry of Trade intends in the near future to begin the regulation of the River Sava upstream to Sissek and then the building of a railway from Sissek to Agram and thence to Karlstadt and Steinbrück.</p></blockquote>
<p>Quite in order. Let the Royal and Imperial Government make rivers navigable there, build railways, bring commerce and industry into the country, and it will discover for how much longer it will then be able to rely on its Croats, No sooner will the Croat exchange the red-coat<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> for the frock-coat, than his enthusiasm for the martial-law emperor will automatically cease.</p>
<p>Ban Jellachich has told the Banat Council that he has granted an amnesty to the pro-Magyar Croats—including the six party leaders<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> —who fled to Hungary and were banned when they did not return after being asked three times.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is reported from the Turkish border that
</p>
<blockquote><p>"there is a great deal of activity in Turkey. In Bosnia large bodies of troops are being armed and concentrated at Travnik. Although scouts report that threats against the borderers<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> are sometimes heard being uttered, it is more likely that these preparations are connected with the political intrigue Palmerston is hatching in Constantinople regarding the Danube provinces with no lesser an aim than to drive the Russians from Moldavia and Wallachia and so uncover the Austrian flank to the east. Austria can expect a strong Note with regard to the 10,000 Russian troops protecting Transylvania."</p></blockquote>

<li id="cite_note-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-3">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The reference is to the so-called party of Magyarisers, or the Croatian-Hungarian party, formed as far back as 1841 and consisting mainly of Croatian-Slavonian nobles and big landowners. The party aimed for a complete merger of Croatia and Slavonia (which administratively formed part of the Hungarian Kingdom within the Austrian Empire) with Hungary as a means to counteract bourgeois reforms and to retain political and social privileges. its members waged a bitter struggle against the representatives of "Illyrism", a national trend dominated mainly by liberal landowners and commercial bourgeoisie. The Illyrians aimed at uniting the South-Slav peoples and at securing broad autonomous rights for them within the framework of the Austrian Empire, on a federative basis. During the 1848 revolution and the increasingly acute national conflict, many Magyarisers fled to Hungary. On June 5, 1848, the sittings of the Sabor of the Southern Slavs opened in Agrarp (Zagreb). Representatives of the liberal landowners and the top sections of the commercial bourgeoisie in Croatia and Slavonia who predominated at the Sabor (the Sabor was also attended by delegates from the Serbs of the Voivodina and the Czechs), professed their loyalty to the Habsburgs and restricted the national programme to the demand for autonomy for the united Slav territories within the Austrian Empire. General Jellachich, who was close to the Right-wing Illyrians, was appointed Ban of Croatia in March 1848. After a brief conflict with the Austrian Government, which led to his dismissal, he was reinstated in September 1848. Placing Croatian and Slavonian military units at the service of Austrian reaction, Jellachich took part in the counter-revolutionary campaign against Hungary and in the suppression of the popular uprising in Vienna. The <i>Banal Council</i> — an administrative body, headed by the Ban, exercised the functions of the Government of Croatia</span>

The area included part of Croatia and southern Hungary. its population was made up of Serbs and Croats who were allotted land in return for military service, the fulfilment of state obligations and payment of duties. Borderers often rose in revolt against this system of military-feudal oppression.</span>

<p>Paris, 15 January 1845</p>
<p>To Dr Ruge</p>
<p>I have learned from a reliable source that the Préfecture de Police are now in possession of orders against you, myself and several others, whereby we are to leave Paris within 24 hours and France within the shortest possible time.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Börnstein can give you further details. In case you were not yet aware of this news, I deemed it proper to inform you of it.</p>
<p>K. Marx

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Marx, Ruge and Bernays were expelled from France for contributing to the newspaper <i>Vorwärts!</i> The French authorities issued the expulsion decree on 11 January 1845, under pressure from the Prussian Government. Hearing about this, Marx hastened to warn Ruge despite the ideological conflict between them (the postmark on the envelope shows that the letter was written on 15 January). The expulsion decree was handed to Marx together with the order to leave Paris within a week. Marx prepared to leave for Brussels on 3 February.</span>

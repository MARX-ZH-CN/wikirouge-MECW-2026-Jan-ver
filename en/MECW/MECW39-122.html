MARX TO ENGELS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>London, 4 November 1852 (?)
Dear Engels,</p>
<p>I am having to dictate these few lines to you today since the perfidious haemorrhoids will not let me sit down.</p>
<p>Enclosed a letter from Schneider which arrived yesterday evening and 1 letter from Collmann to Bangya<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> which kindly send back.</p>
<p>As you see, Szemere wants to have his manuscript<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> back. Vehse told me yesterday that Weerth had arranged an appointment with him in London but had got the date wrong: I duly explained things to him.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>[From Mrs Marx]</p>
<p>Warm regards from the secretary, Marx's spouse. Kossuth is furious with Marx for having told Dana about his DODGE with Bonaparte, Vetter, etc.; Dana has made this material into a fulminating article.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </p>

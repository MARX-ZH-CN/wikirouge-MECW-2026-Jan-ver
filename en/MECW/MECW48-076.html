ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE</p>
<p>IN ROCHESTER</p>
<p>[London, November 1887]</p>
<p>Dear Old Man,</p>
<p>Have received and burned the letter concerned. Had a shrewd idea that the isolation of Rochester wouldn't suit you. In a little hole like that one even misses the irritation of seeing the movement ruined by inept would-be big wigs and business men on the make. But perhaps you'll get used to it. Being in business is, after all, no more boring than teaching music to lazy, recalcitrant pupils. One gets used to counting-house chores; I had to do them for close on thirty years,<sup>9</sup> though I must say I'm glad to be quit of them. Well, let me know <i>honestly</i> how you get on.</p>
<p>Your old friend,</p>
<p>F. E.

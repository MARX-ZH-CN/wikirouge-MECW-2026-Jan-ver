MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 18 July 1853 28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>The day before yesterday I got a letter from Lassalle, who is now in a state of suspense, imagining letters have been inter- cepted, etc. It would have been good had you advised me whether or not the parcel had gone off to him.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Lassalle is still the only one who dares correspond with London, and we must therefore be careful not to put him off. So I would ask you to let me know what the position is about the parcel. The time of its dispatch is of importance to me in another way, i.e. because upon it depends the time of the <i>RETURN</i>.</p>
<p>The last mail brought my wife a most friendly and obliging letter from A. Dana<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> in which he states that he <i>cannot possibly</i> advise us of a business house in London and that AT ALL INSTANCES bills drawn by me will be promptly honoured. He says that my articles are 'HIGHLY VALUED BY THE PROPRIETORS OF THE <i>TRIBUNE</i> AND THE PUBLIC', and sets <i>no</i> limit on the quantity we send him.</p>
<p>In the debate on ADVERTISEMENT DUTY<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> —about a fortnight ago, I think—Mr Bright was loud in his praises of the <i>New-York Tribune</i> and gave an analysis of one of its numbers<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> —the very one containing my article on the budget.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> This is what he said about it:
</p>
<ul><li>'From Great Britain there is an elaborate disquisition on the Right Honourable Gentleman's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> budget, doing him justice in some parts, but not in others, and doing certainly, as far as the Manchester School was concerned, no justice whatever.' *</li></ul>
<p>As regards Jacobi, you must not allow yourself to be deterred by the gaucherie and inexperience of a 23-year-old stripling from the District of Minden who has spent 2 years in jug. He has a good background. I have read his doctoral dissertation and was 'MUCH PLEASED WITH IT'.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>Jones has held some very important meetings which have even attracted the attention of the bourgeois press.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> </p>

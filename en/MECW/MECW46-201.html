<p>TO SORGE IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>London, 9 November 1882</p>
<p>Dear Sorge,</p>
<p>I have paid for <i>The Labour Standard</i> up till 3 December, 4/5d., and advised Shipton to send all future accounts to me.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>Should you wish to cancel the subscription, perhaps you would let me have prompt notification.</p>
<p>Marx was here for 3 weeks, very much better; all he needs now is decent air and careful treatment. His minor ailments have been vanquished to the extent that he will certainly be rid of them next summer. The main thing is to get him through the winter without a recurrence of PLEURISY, and for that reason he has gone to Ventnor in the ISLE OF Wight<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>. whence I have just received a line or two from him.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>So far as circumstances permit, the 3rd edition<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>will now be taken vigorously in hand there and won't, I trust, occupy too much time. For the rest he was very cheerful and sprightly and, if all goes well until next autumn, he will be stronger than he has been for years.</p>
<p>My thanks with regard to Lilienthal. I now know the man as well as if we had been at school together.</p>
<p>I'm glad to hear that your Adolph<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>is getting on well; I trust he will soon find a LINE that will give him the opportunity he wants of getting on quickly. His letters have arrived but, like many others, unfortunately still remain unanswered.</p>
<p>Hepner is a proper Schlemihl<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>; moreover his campaigns, like the one he is waging against Schewitsch, are too much concerned with hair-splitting. Who, after all, is going to wax so enthusiastic about 'German culture'! He really ought to familiarise himself with American culture first. But that is typically German. Here we have someone arriving from a small town in the depths of Germany who cannot wait to enlighten America. However America will BREAK him IN all right and, since he has talent, and at one time also possessed a great deal of gumption, he may yet prove very useful.</p>
<p><br>
16 November</p>
<p>That shows you what things are like here. Having had to break off a week ago I have only today got round to continuing this and, I trust, finishing it off.</p>
<p>Lafargue has been in Paris ever since the spring; his wife<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>followed later, during the summer; she spent a month with Marx in Vevey.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>For Marx had first been in Algiers,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>then in Monte Carlo (Monaco)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>and in both places had suffered a recurrence of PLEURISY. After that he stayed with the Longuets in Argenteuil<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup>where he availed himself of the sulphur springs at nearby Enghien for his chronic bronchitis. Then to Vevey and finally back here.</p>
<p>You might like to know that Lafargue (with a great deal of assistance from me, since he had absolutely no intention of learning German from his wife) has published in French 3 chapters from my <i><a href="MECW25-002.html">Anti-Dühring</a></i> (introduction and the two first chapters of Part III 'Socialism') under the title <i>Socialisme utopique et socialisme scientifique</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup>It made a tremendous impression in France. Most people are too lazy to read stout tomes such as Capital and hence a slim little pamphlet like this has a much more rapid effect. I shall now publish the thing in German — with insertions calculated to give it a strong popular appeal; the ms. is already in Zurich and the first sheet has been printed.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup>I shall send it to you as soon as it is ready. Meanwhile you have, of course, in Dr Stiebeling a purveyor of popular knowledge to America <i>in utraque lingua</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup>. He is a well-meaning man but no theorist and accordingly he is somewhat muddle-headed.</p>
<p>The <i>Egalité</i> is now appearing daily <i>and</i> weekly. Whether the daily edition (in place of the <i>Citoyen</i> which our people were chucked out of thanks to a financial <i>coup</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup>) can keep going depends upon negotiations with a man of means. The <i>Sozialdemokrat</i> is being much too weakkneed in regard to the split between our people and Malon, but the smooth, cunning, rascally Malon (one of the 17 founders of Bakunin's secret 'Alliance'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup>) has so ingratiated himself with the Germans in Paris and our people have made a number of such colossal blunders that the Paris people are doing their utmost to bring pressure to bear on Zurich. What's more, Liebknecht also intrigued with Malon when passing through Paris on his way home from here. If, however, Lafargue and Guesde commit some altogether too extravagant follies, I shall talk the <i>Sozialdemokrat</i> round, never fear.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

Engels produced the pamphlet at Lafargue's request, having rewritten three chapters of Anti-Diihring (Chapter I of the Introduction and chapters I and II of Part III) to form a popular work in its own right. It was first printed by the French socialist magazine La Revue socialiste, Nos. 3, 4 and 5, 1880, and then published, also in 1880, as a pamphlet. The French socialist Benoît Malon embarked on an introduction to it, but his effort was deemed unacceptable, and the introduction as it appeared was written by Marx, who had first consulted Engels (see present edition, Vol. 24, pp. 335-39). In the pamphlet, the introduction carried the signature of Lafargue, whom Marx requested to 'polish the phrases, leaving the gist intact' (see this volume, p. 16).</span>

As he had promised, Engels prepared the German text by making additions to and changes in it, and wrote a preface (present edition, Vol. 24, pp. 457-59). He also supplemented it by his essay 'The Mark' (ibid., pp. 439-56) on the emergence and development of landed property in Germany. The work was finished in September 1882, and the pamphlet was printed in Hottingen-Zurich at the end of the year and was on sale in early 1883 under the title Die Entwicklung des Sozialismus von der Utopie zur Wissenschaft.</span>

<li id="cite_note-16"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-16">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The Alliance of Socialist Democracy was founded by Mikhail Bakunin in Geneva in October 1868 as an international anarchist organisation. In 1869 the Alliance approached the General Council of the International Working Men's Association with a request to be admitted to the International. The General Council agreed to admit individual sections of the Alliance provided the latter dissolved as an independent organisation. On entering the International, Bakunin did not actually comply with this decision and incorporated the Alliance into it under the guise of a section (called 'the Alliance of Socialist Democracy. Central Section'). Marx, Engels and the General Council fought the Alliance, exposing it as a sect hostile to the working-class movement (for details, see present edition, Vol. 23). The Hague Congress of the International (1872) dealt a severe blow at the anarchists and expelled the Alliance's leaders Mikhail Bakunin and James Guillaume from the International.</span>

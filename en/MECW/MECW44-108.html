ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT</p>
<p>IN LEIPZIG</p>
<p>[London, not later than 27 July 1871]</p>
<p>Dear Liebknecht,</p>
<p>Herewith the final portion<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>When I gave you the <i>Peasant War,</i> you did not even send me a single copy of it.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> In order to procure some, I had to order them through the local Workers' Society.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> This time I am counting on more decent treatment and would like to have <i>for myself</i> 25 copies of a separate offprint of the Address. I not only have private debts of politeness to repay, but I also have to present copies to the local and other German workers. Apart from myself, the <i>General Council</i> should also be sent 25 copies. You can add 50 copies of Borkheim's pamphlet, for which we shall <i>pay,</i> as well as around 6 copies each of your other publications (1 doz. each of Bebel's and of Dietzgen's things), for which we shall pay too.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p>We shall also have the German translation printed in America as soon as the complete text becomes available.

MARX TO ADOLF CLUSS</p>
<p>IN WASHINGTON</p>
<p>[London, 26 April 1853]</p>
<p>Dear Cluss,</p>
<p>You must by now have received three letters from me.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Enclosed a Jones <i>Paper</i>, containing an anti-<i>Times</i> article by 'Englishman'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>If the <i>Cologne Revelations</i> have not yet been printed as a pamphlet, or <i>gratis</i> as such by the <i>Neu-England-Zeitung</i>, do nothing more about it, as it is now too late.</p>
<p>Willich has written to Herzen (the Russian) to say that everything is going 'splendidly', that he has achieved 'great results' and will soon be returning.</p>
<p>Mr <i>Hentze</i>, for one, is again implicated in the Berlin business.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>In any case, as Willich-Kinkel's agent, he would have been possessed of old proclamations and revolutionary recipes. Furthermore, he was destined by these great men to be military commander of Berlin.</p>
<p>The local Rollinists<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>are blushing for shame over Ruge's proclamation of which they were informed by us. In no case had Ledru given Ruge permission to publish this discreditable letter. Ruge extorted the letter from Ledru through the latter's ex-servant, the ex-Palatinate lawyer, and ex-French deputy, <i>Savoye</i>—one-time pedlar of German <i>adjectival</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>At all events, Ledru has sunk lower than ever before.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

It described the condition of various classes of English society and analysed the development of class struggle in England. Judging by Weydemeyer's letter to Marx of 24 May 1853, the letter was published in the American democratic papers at the end of 1852 or beginning of 1853</span>

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 1 June 1859</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Enclosed 1 copy of the <i>Presse</i> containing some particulars that may be of interest to you. No answer from that fellow, Friedländer,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>needless to say. However, my present explanation for this is as follows: When he lectured Friedländer about bias,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lassalle did so, OF COURSE, not only in his but also in my name. Friedländer believes that I am hand in glove with Heraclitus the Dark Philosopher.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>So he naturally can't imagine that under PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES I can write for a Viennese paper. Every day the Vienna <i>Presse</i> contains veiled attacks upon the Berlin wiseacre. Thus, for instance, in a leading article on 29 May:</p>
<p>'But how can one demand a sense of national self-respect of those speculative minds which see in Napoleon III the avenging arm of history and, in his alleged genius for liberating the peoples, complacently admire the reflection of the ineptitude, pedantry and aridity of their own categorising intellects.'</p>
<p>The very insistence with which Lassalle required of me not to write any more to his cousin<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>is evidence that the fellow carried on his intrigues <i>in my name also.</i> Thus the blockhead has frustrated the best prospect I had for the summer. Besides, in certain eventualities it would be a good thing if I had some say in the Vienna <i>Presse.</i></p>
<p>When you next write about Garibaldi, WHATEVER MAY BE HIS FATE, crack a joke about the curious position in which only 'his uncle's nephew'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>could have found himself, namely that beside him the leader of the volunteer corps figures as a HERO. Can you imagine anything of the kind happening under the old Napoleon? By the by, in today's <i>Times</i> the Paris correspondent writes that the Bonapartists are already GRUMBLING loudly about Garibaldi's 'fame', and that A FEW SELECT POLICE have been smuggled into his corps and send in detailed reports about him.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>Adhering strictly to Mazzini's instructions, Garibaldi <i>omitted</i> all mention of Bonaparte in his proclamation.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>Mazzini's latest thing<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>is not, by the by, as good as</p>
<p>I thought. I had only run my eye over some excerpts. His old complaints about socialism. <i>We</i> can do nothing with him direct. But he could with advantage be used as an authority against Kossuth, etc. By the by, in his last number,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>which I shall send you at the end of this week, you will reacquaint yourself with Mr Karl Blind's importance.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Blind is no longer with the <i>Hermann,</i> but is greatly mistaken if he's hoping to get onto the <i>Volk.</i> Feeble though the little sheet may be, it has made the entire emigration down here froth at the mouth with rage. Among others Tausenau and Co., who are paid by Kossuth-Bonaparte to form German OPINION' in London.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">In his letter of 17 December 1857 to Marx, Lassalle enclosed a letter from his cousin Max Friedländer to Marx inviting him to contribute to the Vienna newspaper, <i>Die Presse.</i> Friedländer became one of its editors in 1856. Previously he had taken part in publishing the democratic paper <i>Neue Oder-Zeitung,</i> to which Marx also contributed throughout 1855. Not knowing the political line of <i>Die Presse</i> at the time, Marx did not agree, one of the reasons being probably the condition imposed by Friedländer: to criticise Napoleon III's policy and abstain from attacking Palmerston. In 1859 negotiations with Friedländer were resumed and lasted for a long time. Their success was hampered, on the one hand, by Lassalle's pro-Bonapartist statements during the Italian war of 1859 which evoked dissatisfaction on the part of Friedländer, who for a time thought that Marx approved of these statements, and on the other hand, by the editors' tendency to be duped by the pseudo-constitutional demagogy of the new Austrian government of Schmerling, which put Marx on the alert. Only in October 1861 when <i>Die Presse</i> criticised the government did Marx agree to be its London correspondent.</span>

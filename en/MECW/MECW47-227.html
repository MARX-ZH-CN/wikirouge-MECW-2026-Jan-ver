<p><i>To Florence Kelley Wischnewetsky in Zurich</i></p>
<p><br>
<b>London, January 7, 1886</b></p>
<p><b>122 Regent's Park Road, N.W.</b></p>
<p>Dear Mrs Wischnewetzky,</p>
<p>I have received your ms. but have not as yet been able to look at it, so cannot say how long it will take me. Anyhow I shall lose no time, you may be sure.</p>
<p>As to those wise Americans who think their country exempt from the consequences of fully expanded capitalist production, they seem to live in blissful ignorance of the fact that sundry States, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, etc., have such an institution as a Labour Bureau from the reports of which they might learn something to the contrary.</p>
<p>Yours very truly,</p>
<p>F. Engels</p>

<p><i>Cologne,</i> February 16. A few days ago we offered condolences to the leading article of the <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i> signed D which saw in the elections to the Second Chamber (see No. 33 of the <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i>) the defeat of the "<i>great Centre"</i> of the German nation and discerned two Chambers, one of which would not yet be constitutional, the other not yet monarchical.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Storms will blow from opposite poles, a dead past will fight against a distant, perhaps never attainable future."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what will become of the "<i>Centre</i> of the German nation"? Thus wailed <i>Schwanbeck.</i></p>
<p><i>Brüggemann</i>, of the three stars, is storming from the "opposite pole" against his friend in today's issue of the same <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i>.</p>
<p><i>No Centre,</i> says the man of the "legal basis", the merry gentleman who, with solemn pedantry, invariably raises the <i>status quo</i> to an immortal <i>principle</i>; <i>no Centre</i>, that is the joke of it. No Centre, that is <i>,no cowardice, no indecision, no hollow ambition</i>! No Centre, that is the doctrine of it! The Centre will in future dissolve into a "<i>true</i>" Left and a "<i>true</i>" Right! That is the true meaning of it.</p>
<p>Thus Brüggemann, the "true" man of "<i>true</i>" decision.</p>
<p>In other words: Brüggemann shifts from <i>the Centre</i> to <i>the Right:</i> the "parliamentary correspondence" has brought him to parleying. We tremble for the Right.</p>
<p>But let the melancholy D, dying of too much thinking in the night, argue with the merry three stars. <i>Ça ne nous regards pas!</i> [That does not concern us]

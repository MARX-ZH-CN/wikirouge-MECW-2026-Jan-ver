ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>Brighton, 23 February 1877<br>
42 King's Road
<br>Dear Moor,
<br>I wrote to Bignami last week, took out a subscription to the <i>Plebe,</i> and wrote to him about the elections.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Three days ago, before we left,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I received 3 numbers, and he is going to let me have some that are missing.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> My intervention could not have come at a better time.
<br><i>Plebe,</i> 7 January, reports proceedings at the Assizes against <i>Bignami,</i> the <i>Questore</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> of Turin (the self-same man who treated Terzaghi to a 'vermouth', see <i>Alliance de la Démocratie Socialiste</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> ), for <i>embezzlement</i> (<i>tout comme chez nous</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> ). A policeman, one Blandini, stated that, on Bignami's orders, he had carried out a <i>pro-forma</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> house search chez Terzaghi, having also been ordered by Bignami only to remove what Terzaghi should give him. When a warrant went out for Terzaghi's arrest, he had already been notified by another policeman, Premerlani, acting on Bignami's orders; Terzaghi <i>era un agente segreto di Bignami che gli dava tre lire</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> (francs) <i>al giorno!</i> About which the <i>Plebe</i> remarked that this showed what use the <i>fondi segreti dei governi di classe</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> were put to. To which there came a reply from a little Bakuninist sheet, <i>II Martello</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> —the name betrays my Cafiero.—Since discussion of the revolting Terzaghi case was not permissible, the little sheet fastened on the <i>fondi segreti dei governi di classe:</i> so in your case, it said, the <i>governi non di classe</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> would likewise have <i>fondi segreti,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> so in your case, too, everything would remain as before—there follows all the same old anarchist rigmarole <i>que l'on sait.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> Having replied to this in due form, the <i>Plebe</i> at once proceeded to attack the <i>Bulletin Jurassien</i> for having been sent into a rage by four lines in the <i>Plebe</i> and acting as though the <i>Plebe</i> were enraged although it had simply been <i>edificata</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup> by the <i>Jurassien's</i> insinuation.
<br>Come to that, [said the <i>Plebe,]</i> one would have to be exceedingly <i>ingenuo</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup> to take the bait proffered by people who, green with envy, went knocking at door after door to beg for a bit of animosity towards us in return for their calumnies. The hand, which has long been sowing tares and discord, is sufficiently well known for its Loyolan<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup> machinations to be instantly detectable and <i>gli onesti non ne facciano tantosto giustizia?</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup> <br>The same No. contains a letter from E. Dörenberg (Drbg. of the <i>Berliner Freie Presse)</i> on the elections in Berlin.
<br>No. of 16 February, letter from Brussels, 'Cesar De Paepe' about the recent Flemish agitation for factory laws and general suffrage, ends:
<br><i>Noi crediamo altresi di arrivare, con questo metodo, più prontamente e più puramente all'emancipazione del proletario, piuttosto che star Xi, abbaiando alia luna per degli anni e dei quarti di secolo, e attendendo che mamma Rivoluzione voglia degnarsi di venire a spezzarsi le catene dei lavoratori)</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" id="cite_ref-18">[18]</a></sup> <br>It further speaks of old Becker's proclamation<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" id="cite_ref-19">[19]</a></sup> as a <i>symptom,</i> and in most amicable terms.
<br>A very delighted letter from Bignami today, in which he says he will print my stuff on the elections, and confirms that the <i>Federazione dell'alta Italia,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" id="cite_ref-20">[20]</a></sup> which extends from Venice to Turin and will shortly be holding a congress,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" id="cite_ref-21">[21]</a></sup> <i>vuole lottare sul terreno del suffragio universale.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" id="cite_ref-22">[22]</a></sup> The <i>Plebe</i> is its official organ.
<br>Thus the stronghold of lawyers, literati and dilettanti in Italy has been breached. And the best part of it is that all the former Alliance men<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23" id="cite_ref-23">[23]</a></sup> in Milan, Mauro Gandolfi, etc., of Cuno's time also seem to have gone over. Indeed, a bogus working men's movement could not have survived long in an industrial city like Milan. And Northern Italy is decisive not only strategically, but also to the working men's movement throughout the whole length of the agrarian peninsula.
<br>Thus the world government in Neuchâtel<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24" id="cite_ref-24">[24]</a></sup> has nothing left that is uncontested except for Spain, and how long will that last?
<br>If these events are to be followed more closely, by the way, it is high time that Mr Demuth took out a subscription to the <i>Bulletin jurassien,</i> as agreed. After all, we've got to know what anathemas are being uttered by the Holy See's universal dictator and deputy.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25" id="cite_ref-25">[25]</a></sup> <br>Warmest regards to all,
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

The Alliance had sections in Italy, Spain, Switzerland and in the south of France. In 1869, it applied to the General Council of the International Working Men's Association for admission. The General Council agreed to admit the sections to the International on condition that the Alliance was disbanded as an independent organisation. Having joined the International, Bakunin to all intents and purposes ignored this decision and incorporated the Alliance into the International under the guise of a Geneva Section (called the 'Alliance of Socialist Democracy. Central Section'). Marx, Engels and the General Council resolutely opposed the Alliance, exposing it as a sect hostile to the working-class movement which sought to split it and obstruct its independent development. At the Hague Congress of the International (1872), the Bakuninists sustained a shattering blow. Bakunin and Guillaume, the leaders of the Alliance, were expelled from the International.</span>

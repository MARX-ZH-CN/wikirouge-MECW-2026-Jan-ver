ENGELS TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN</p>
<p>IN HANOVER</p>
<p>Manchester, 13 December 1867</p>
<p>Dear Kugelmann,</p>
<p>'Pursuant to mine humbly of yesterday'—so that you do not forget all the elements of commercial style—you will find enclosed 2 articles, one examining the <i>content</i> of the book, for the <i>Beobachter</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and the other merely discussing points of fact, for the <i>Gewerbeblatt</i> or the <i>Staats-Anzeiger</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>You will appreciate the difficulties which had to be overcome with the first of these when you consider that the editor of the <i>Beobachter</i> is the tedious talker from Swabia, <i>Karl Mayer,</i> from <i>Herr Vogt,</i> who will certainly never knowingly do us any favours. You realise that these articles must only be submitted in copy, but I would ask you to keep all the originals, as one never knows what they may be needed for.</p>
<p>I shall also be sending something for the <i>Merkur,</i> but I cannot yet do so much work in the evening now as I get too excited by it and last night again e.g. I could scarce sleep for thinking of the articles. The weather, business and the vestiges of the <i>tic douloureux</i> from last Sunday are keeping me from riding, and so I cannot get back to normal.</p>
<p>I have not read about the Siebenmark affair<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> in the <i>Zukunft,</i> I but rarely set eyes on the paper.</p>
<p>Farewell for today. It is 6 o'clock in the evening, closing time, and I am tired and hungry.</p>
<p>Yours</p>
<p>F. E.

During the trial which took place in Berlin late in 1867, the employers' shady practices were brought to light: they provided their home-workers with dampened wool that lost weight while being processed, for which the workers were heavily fined by the firm. The case was given great publicity.</span>

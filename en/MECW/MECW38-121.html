<p>[Rough copy]</p>
<p>London, 17 July 1850<br>
64 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Blind,</p>
<p>Our long silence was due to a misunderstanding. For we believed that the Central Authority's second circular<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>had been brought you 6 weeks or 2 months ago [by] our emissary, Klein, and we were waiting for your answer. [Now] it transpires that Klein has [brought] back nothing of the kind to Brussels.</p>
<p>Write to me as soon as possible and in a special enclosure to the [Central Authority]. We are thinking of convening a congress here in a few (8) weeks' time.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>What do you [make] of the Holstein business?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>We shall shortly be dispatching an emissary [who] worked there for two years and knows [exactly] who is who and what is what.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Concerning my own fortunes and the manifold vicissitudes which I [...] in, some other time.</p>
<p>I am approaching you this time about a private matter [...], that, if at all possible, you will not refuse me your assistance. I had arranged with my family that I would settle my financial affairs with my uncle Philips in Holland [...] weeks, [for which] purpose I was to visit Holland in person. An [...] illness of my wife constantly rendered my departure impossible. And now I shall not be able to go there for several weeks, because two of my uncle's daughters are being married, one after the other, from his house, so th[at] business matters cannot be settled till several weeks later.</p>
<p>With this affair in mind, I meanwhile drew a bill for £20 (500 fr.) with a [merchant] firm<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>here in London on the strength of this arrangement. The bill matures on Monday or Wednesday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>If I were unable to pay it, I would lay myself open to a public [...] which, given the present state of the parties here, and [my] relations with the Prussian Embassy and the English Ministry, [could] have most disagreeable consequences.</p>
<p>Now I hear that <i>Goegg</i> in Paris has a considerable amount of capital available just now. Would you write to him immediately, explaining the circumstances to him and inquiring whether he could advance me the money on a promissory note or a bill. <i>Periculum in mora.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Pending the arrangement in Holland I am, in the literal sense of the word, <i>dépourvu</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>save for my last shilling.</p>
<p>I rely on you to do your utmost.</p>
<p>Your<br>
K. Marx

<li id="cite_note-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-3">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Marx may have had in mind the situation in the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein in the summer of 1850, when Communist League members conducted intense propaganda among the military units there. During the 1848 revolution the population of the duchy staged a national liberation uprising against Danish rule, demanding union with Germany. Prussian circles launched a phoney war against Denmark, but a truce was signed on 26 August 1848. The Prusso-Danish war was resumed at the end of March 1849 and it ended with a new betrayal by Prussia signing a peace treaty with the Danish monarchy on 2 July 1850. As a result the insurgents were compelled to continue the war on their own and on 24-25 July 1850 the Schleswig-Holstein army was defeated by Danish troops, and ceased resistance.</span>

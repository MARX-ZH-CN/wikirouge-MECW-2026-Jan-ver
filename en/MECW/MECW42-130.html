MARX TO ENGELS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 13 February 1866</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>Tell or write to Gumpert to send me the prescription with instructions for use. As I have confidence in him, he owes it to the best of 'Political Economy'" if nothing else to ignore professional etiquette and treat me from Manchester.</p>
<p>I was laid up again yesterday with a vicious cur of a carbuncle erupting on left loin. If I had enough money, that is, more&gt;—0, for my family, and if my book were ready, I would care not a fig whether I was thrown on the charnel heap today or tomorrow, alias perished. But things being as they are, that cannot be contemplated just yet.</p>
<p>As far as this 'damned' book is concerned, the position now is: it was <i>ready</i> at the end of December.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> The treatise on ground rent alone, the penultimate chapter, is in its present form almost long enough to be a book in itself.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> I have been going to the Museum<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> in the day-time and writing at night. I had to plough through the new agricultural chemistry in Germany, in particular Liebig and Schönbein, which is more important for this matter than all the economists put together, as well as the enormous amount of material that the French have produced since I last dealt with this point. I concluded my theoretical investigation of ground rent 2 years ago. And a great deal had been achieved, especially in the period since then, fully confirming my theory incidentally. And the opening up of Japan<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> (by and large I normally never read travel-books if I am not professionally obliged to) was also important here. So here was the 'SHIFTING SYSTEM', as it was applied by those curs of English manufacturers to <i>one and the same</i> persons in 1848-50, being applied by me to myself.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Although ready, the manuscript, which in its present form is gigantic, is not fit for publishing for anyone but myself, not even for you.</p>
<p>I began the business of copying out and <i>polishing the style</i> on the dot of January first, and it all went ahead swimmingly, as I naturally enjoy licking the infant clean after long birth-pangs. But then the carbuncle intervened again, so that I have since been unable to make any more progress but only to fill out with more facts those sections which were, according to the plan, already finished.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I agree with you and shall get the first volume to Meissner as soon as it is ready.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> But in order to complete it, I must at least be able to <i>sit.</i></p>
<p>Please do not forget to write to Watts,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> as I have now reached my chapter on machinery.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Could you not dash off an article on Prussia for <i>The Commonwealth,</i> under the rubric <i>Berlin?</i> Bear in mind how important it is for us to have a firm footing in London. The articles on Poland<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> can take their time. But with the German papers, which are at your disposal, it would be fun for you to write about Prussia. My influence here depends partly on people seeing at last that I do not stand entirely alone.</p>
<p>I am less bothered by political affairs (not <i>qua'<b><sup>d</sup></b></i><b> individual but on account of the book) than by the <i>economic</i> situation, which is pointing more and more ominously to a crisis.</b></p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>Greetings to your 'Irish' lady-friend.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> The Irish ladies, notabene Roses O'Donovan, etc., have thanked us for the appeal in our paper and for Fox's articles.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> </p>

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">After the publication of Part One of <i>A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</i> in 1859, Marx wrote a voluminous economic manuscript in 1861-63 which is a second, after the manuscript of 1857-58, detailed rough version of his future <i>Capital.</i> By 1863, Marx had finally decided to publish his work in four books: the first three books—theoretical, and the fourth—historical-literary. Having completed the 1861-63 manuscript, in August 1863 Marx began preparing his <i>Capital</i> for the press.<br>In the course of this work he wrote a third preparatory version of <i>Capital</i>—the Economic Manuscript of 1863-65 consisting of three theoretical books (the outline of the fourth book, <i>Theories of Surplus Value,</i> was in the 1861-63 manuscript). Subsequently, having finished them, Marx again returned to the first book. On Engels' advice he decided to publish it before the others were ready. Marx gave the finishing touches to it in 1866 and most of 1867. The first German edition of the first book—Volume One of <i>Capital</i>—appeared in September 1867. As agreed with Otto Meissner, a Hamburg publisher, the second and third books, devoted to the analysis of the process of circulation of capital and the forms of capitalist production as a whole, were to be published as Volume Two of <i>Capital,</i> and the fourth book, on the 'history of economic theories', as the concluding volume, Volume Three, of <i>Capital.</i><br>However, during his lifetime Marx did not manage to prepare the last books of <i>Capital</i> for the press. It was Engels who after Marx's death did this and published his manuscripts of the second and third books, as Volume Two (1885) and Volume Three (1894) of <i>Capital.</i> Engels also intended to publish the above-mentioned manuscript of the fourth book, as Volume Four of <i>Capital,</i> but did not materialise this intention during his lifetime. In the present edition of the <i>Collected Works</i> of Marx and Engels, this book is included in the Economic Manuscript of 1861-63 (vols 30-34), while the first three volumes of <i>Capital</i> published in vols 35-37.</span>

Liebig's <i>Die Chemie in ihrer Anwendung auf Agricultur und Physiologie,</i> Braunschweig, 1862. Marx's notebook of excerpts for 1865, which he probably filled in while working on his Economic Manuscript of 1863-65, contains synopses of these two works.<br>When developing the theory of ground rent Marx used, besides the above-mentioned work by Liebig, the following books: L. de Lavergne, <i>The Rural Economy of England, Scotland and Ireland.</i> Translated from the French, Edinburgh and London, 1855; and L'Mounier, <i>De l'agriculture en France, d'après les documents officiels, avec des remarques par Rubichon,</i> Tomes 1-2, Paris, 1846.</span>

Under this system the children and juveniles, after several hours' work, were moved the same day to another workshop or factory in order to deceive the factory inspectors. As a result, their entire working day was often even longer than before the adoption of the ten hours act (see present edition, Vol. 35).</span>

<br><i>To Wilhelm Liebknecht in Leipzig</i>
<br><b>[London,] 15 January 1866</b>
<br>Dear <b>Library</b>,
<br>Happy New Year!
<br>You must excuse my silence, ditto the brevity of these lines of mine. You will not believe <b>how bothered</b> I am for time. <em>Indisposition</em>, forever recurring periodically, all manner of unfortunate <em>mischances demands made on me</em> by the <b>International Association</b>, etc., have confiscated every free moment I have for writing out the fair copy of my manuscript. [<em>Capital</em>] I hope to be able to take Volume I of it to the publisher for printing myself in March. (The whole thing, the two volumes, will, however, appear <em>simultaneously</em> This <em>is good</em>.)
<br>So, this very much by way of summary.
<br>Today I am sending you by post the 2 latest issues of <em>The Workman's Advocate,</em> of which Eccarius is now editor. If, as I hope, you send any <em>articles</em> for it, please do so to me (political, social, as you will).
<br>I also enclose <b>cards of membership</b> for you. I have paid for them. You can therefore give them to whomever you like, and have only to inscribe the name and after the £, put 0, but after the Os., 1d.
<br>The conditions, <b>generally</b>, are these: <em>a society as such</em> that wishes to join has an <em>Association collective membership Card</em>, for which 5s. per year is to be paid. But, if all the members join individually, they have to take out cards of the kind I am sending you. This is advantageous for workers. The cards serve as a passport abroad, and their <em>confréres</em> in London, Paris, Brussels, Lyons, Geneva, etc., will get jobs for them.
<br>The Association has made great progress. It already has 1 official English paper, <em>The Workman's Advocate,</em> a Brussels one, <em>La Tribune du Peuple,</em> a French one in Geneva, <em>Journal de 1'Association Internationale des Travailleurs, Section de la Suisse Romande</em>, and a German one in Geneva, <em>Der Vorbote,</em> which will be appearing in a few days. <em>Address: 6 rue du Môle, Genf, J. P. Becker,</em> in case you want to write to the old man occasionally (as I hope you will).
<br>I am now hoping you will soon make it possible for me to announce the foundation of a Leipzig section and enable me to present correspondence. (<em>In English.</em> It can then be used in <em>The Workman's Advocate</em> as well.) The number is not important, although <b>the more, the better</b>.
<br>If people want to join <em>en masse,</em> as a society, you will see that the <em>total price</em> of 5s., which they have to pay annually, is <em>nothing</em>.
<br>J. P. Becker writes to me:

<blockquote>
<br>'Sections are going to be formed in Leipzig, Gotha, Stuttgart and Nuremberg; shall we register them here for the time being, until there is a large number and a Central Committee has been formed in Germany?'

</blockquote>
<br>I have replied <em>in the affirmative</em>. However, since there can be several branches in one town, you and your people can establish links direct with us.
<br>I have had a second letter from the Berliners. I am at last writing to them today. Ditto to Dr Kugelmann.
<br><em>Salut</em>.
<br>Your<br>K. M.
<br>I will let you know next time what questions are to be dealt with at the Geneva Congress at the end of May.

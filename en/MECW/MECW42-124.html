<p><i>To Wilhelm Liebknecht in Leipzig</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 15 January 1866</b></p>
<p>Dear <b>Library</b>,</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>You must excuse my silence, ditto the brevity of these lines of mine. You will not believe <b>how bothered</b> I am for time. <i>Indisposition</i>, forever recurring periodically, all manner of unfortunate <i>mischances demands made on me</i> by the <b>International Association</b>, etc., have confiscated every free moment I have for writing out the fair copy of my manuscript. [<i>Capital</i>] I hope to be able to take Volume I of it to the publisher for printing myself in March. (The whole thing, the two volumes, will, however, appear <i>simultaneously</i> This <i>is good</i>.)</p>
<p>So, this very much by way of summary.</p>
<p>Today I am sending you by post the 2 latest issues of <i>The Workman's Advocate,</i> of which Eccarius is now editor. If, as I hope, you send any <i>articles</i> for it, please do so to me (political, social, as you will).</p>
<p>I also enclose <b>cards of membership</b> for you. I have paid for them. You can therefore give them to whomever you like, and have only to inscribe the name and after the £, put 0, but after the Os., 1d.</p>
<p>The conditions, <b>generally</b>, are these: <i>a society as such</i> that wishes to join has an <i>Association collective membership Card</i>, for which 5s. per year is to be paid. But, if all the members join individually, they have to take out cards of the kind I am sending you. This is advantageous for workers. The cards serve as a passport abroad, and their <i>confréres</i> in London, Paris, Brussels, Lyons, Geneva, etc., will get jobs for them.</p>
<p>The Association has made great progress. It already has 1 official English paper, <i>The Workman's Advocate,</i> a Brussels one, <i>La Tribune du Peuple,</i> a French one in Geneva, <i>Journal de 1'Association Internationale des Travailleurs, Section de la Suisse Romande</i>, and a German one in Geneva, <i>Der Vorbote,</i> which will be appearing in a few days. <i>Address: 6 rue du Môle, Genf, J. P. Becker,</i> in case you want to write to the old man occasionally (as I hope you will).</p>
<p>I am now hoping you will soon make it possible for me to announce the foundation of a Leipzig section and enable me to present correspondence. (<i>In English.</i> It can then be used in <i>The Workman's Advocate</i> as well.) The number is not important, although <b>the more, the better</b>.</p>
<p>If people want to join <i>en masse,</i> as a society, you will see that the <i>total price</i> of 5s., which they have to pay annually, is <i>nothing</i>.</p>
<p>J. P. Becker writes to me:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Sections are going to be formed in Leipzig, Gotha, Stuttgart and Nuremberg; shall we register them here for the time being, until there is a large number and a Central Committee has been formed in Germany?'
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have replied <i>in the affirmative</i>. However, since there can be several branches in one town, you and your people can establish links direct with us.</p>
<p>I have had a second letter from the Berliners. I am at last writing to them today. Ditto to Dr Kugelmann.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i>.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.</p>
<p>I will let you know next time what questions are to be dealt with at the Geneva Congress at the end of May.

<div class="Publication">Written: about February 24, 1839<br>First published: in Der Bremer Stadtbote No. 4, February 24, 1839</div>

<p>Note from MECW vol. 2, 1975 :
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this poem Engels ridiculed the heated polemic between the weekly <i>Der Bremer Stadtbote</i> and the newspaper <i>Bremisches Unterhaltungsblatt</i> (see Engels' letters to his brother Hermann of March 11-12, 1839, and to his sister Marie of March 12, 1839). For fun Engels sent this poem to Der Bremer Stadtbote under the pen-name of Theodor H. (Hildebrand). Not realising its ironical character, the editors published the poem as a regular item against the rival newspaper. The editors of the <i>Bremisches Unterhaltungsblatt</i>, however, perceived the poem's irony directed against <i>Der Bremer Stadtbote</i> and reprinted it with appropriate comments.</p>
<p>In this volume the poem is given according to the <i>Bremisches Unterhaltungsblatt</i> since the Publishers do not possess a copy of <i>Der Bremer Stadtbote.</i>

<p>Why can you never leave what's well alone<br>And let a little honest striving<br>Or well-meant words said in a kindly tone<br>Do their good work among the living?<br>To falsify what people really mean<br>Is very easy to arrange.<br>Bad in the good is all too quickly seen,<br>But good to bad you'll never change.</p>
<p>Or is it that you seriously expect<br>To gain advantages by making light<br>Of others' efforts? If you want respect,<br>Then win respect in your own right.<br>Use your own brains then; if you would succeed<br>Prepare to make the upward climb;<br>Hanging behind those who are in the lead,<br>Belittling them, you waste your time.</p>
<p>Say, can you hope to do the courier wrong<br>For whom you lay your spiteful snares?<br>He carries news, so let him pass along<br>As on his lawful way he fares.<br>If truth he brings, truth shall indeed prevail,<br>Transcending perfidy and fraud.<br>The wise old saying hits it on the nail<br>"Honesty is its own reward."</p>
<p><br>
Theodor H.

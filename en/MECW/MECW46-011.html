MARX TO FERDINAND DOMELA NIEUWENHUIS</p>
<p>IN THE HAGUE</p>
<p>London, 27 June 1880<br>41 Maitland Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>At the urgent insistence of my doctor I must refrain from work of any kind for some time to come; [indeed]<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I should already have left London on a recuperative trip to the seaside or mountains had I not been prevented from doing so by the very serious illness of my wife. Letters sent to the above address, however, will always find me, as they will be forwarded.</p>
<p>But my present state of health apart, I could not have complied with your request, if only because I don't know enough Dutch to be able to judge whether this or that expression is appropriate.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, to go by the essays of yours I have read in the <i>Jahr- buch der Sozialwissenschaft</i> (Volume I, Second Half), I have not the slightest doubt that you are the right man to provide the Dutch with a résumé of <i>Capital</i>—I would also mention <i>en passant</i> that Mr Schramm (C. A. S., p. 81)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <i>misconstrues my theory of value.</i> From a note in <i>Capital</i> to the effect that A. Smith and Ricardo are mistaken in <i>lumping together value</i> and <i>price of production</i><sup>2</sup> 7 (let alone <i>market prices,</i> therefore) — he could already have gathered that the connec- tion between 'value' and 'price of production', hence also between 'value' and the market prices that oscillate about the 'price of pro- duction', has no place whatever in the theory of value as such, still less can it be anticipated by cliché-ridden, scholastic generalisations.</p>
<p>Under present circumstances the 2nd part of <i>Capital</i> cannot appear in Germany, which I am quite glad of inasmuch as certain economic phenomena are, at this precise moment, entering upon a new phase of development and hence call for fresh appraisal.</p>
<p>With kindest regards,</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>[Karl Marx]

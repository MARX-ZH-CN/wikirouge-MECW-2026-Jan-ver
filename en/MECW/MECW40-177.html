MARX TO ENGELS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>IN MANCHESTER
<br>London, 20 July 1858
9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, Haverstock Hill
<br>Dear Engels,
<br>When your letter arrived on Saturday I did not reply immediately because I first wanted to see what response I got to another 'ATTEMPT' before taking advantage of the authorisation you gave me. On Monday, however, I received an answer in the negative. Hence any further delay seemed impracticable. Accord- ingly to Freiligrath. Today he informed me in writing that the thing could be proceeded with on the TERMS you proposed, but not until 3 August since his USURER was unable to go ahead any earlier. I shall therefore write and tell him to put the business in hand by 3 August.
<br>On Saturday I had a long letter from my mother. For I had asked Mrs Liebknecht, who was going to Germany, to take the old girl a portrait of our youngest child<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> with a brief note in which I
<br>mentioned my being frequently ill but said nothing about o u r other circumstances.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> T h e old girl's letter is such as to suggest the possibility of a meeting between us a few weeks hence. IF SO, I SHOULD ARRANGE THINGS. But I mustn't be too pressing IN THIS RESPECT. Otherwise she will promptly draw BACK.
<br>T h a n k you for the <i>Tribune</i> article.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> More tomorrow.
<br>Your
<br>K. M.

Marx made an  entry in his notebook on 27 July about the despatch of the article to New York,  giving its heading as 'Transport of Troops to India' (see present edition,  Vol. 15). The<i> Tribune</i> editors introduced changes into the article and printed it  under the heading 'How the Indian War has been Mismanaged'.—334</span>

ENGELS TO PASQUALE MARTIGNETTI</p>
<p>IN BENEVENTO</p>
<p>London, 30 March 1892</p>
<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>I can no longer lay my hands on the issue of <i>Lotta<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </i> you mentioned in your postcard of the 26th, but in any case it would in my view be a mistake and an offence against the best interests of the party were a socialist to give the first subaltern who came along the opportunity of killing him.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> By employing what for them would be the perfectly safe method of duelling with a socialist, it would be an easy matter for young officers to gain not only a great reputation for dash, but also rapid promotion, and, what's more, make away with our best people. We ought not to let ourselves in for that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Circumstances might arise in which even our own people might find that a duel was unavoidable; a French or Italian deputy might be forced to engage in a political duel should the refusal of a challenge be more injurious to the party than its acceptance, especially if it was our own deputy who was responsible for the affront. But to agree to a duel or even provoke one except in cases of dire necessity is, to my mind, absurd.</p>
<p>I am sending you the English translation of my <i>Die Lage der arbeiten- den Klasse in England</i> which has just come out. I trust it will be of use to you in your English studies.</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>F. Engels

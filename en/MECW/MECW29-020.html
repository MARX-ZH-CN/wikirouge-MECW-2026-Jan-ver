<blockquote>
<p>References to My Own Notebooks belong to the period when, after an interruption caused by his editorial work on the newspaper Das Volk (summer 1859), writing his pamphlet Herr Vogt and other circumstances, Marx resumed intensive studies of political economy and returned to his work on the subsequent parts of A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, primarily on its third chapter, devoted to capital. "A week ago I made a serious start on my book," he wrote to Engels on June 10, 1861 (see MECW, Vol. 41, p. 292). Evidently, the first thing Marx did was to systematise the material already collected. For this purpose, he made use of the last, as yet empty, pages of his Notebook B". Pages 1-19 of this notebook contain the end of the fragment of the original text of A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, written as far back as the autumn of 1858. Pages 20-27 contain passages from different economic sources, evidently written later on as they include references to editions published in 1860. The References published here are to be found on pages 28-36 of Notebook B" (these pages are given here in editorial square brackets, and oblique lines are substituted for the square brackets used by Marx himself).</p>
<p>The References constitute a concise review of the contents of the notebooks containing the economic manuscripts of 1857-1858 (Notebook M with "Introduction", notebooks I-VII) and also of notebooks with the original text of A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy (notebooks C, B' and B"). In this review, Marx included material he had not used in the first part of A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, completed in January 1859. Hewrote this review in order to facilitate writing the part of his economic work that was to be the continuation of the first part of A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy. When writing the References, Marx worked out a plan for the third chapter of A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy and later on implemented it in a large Economic Manuscript of 1861-1863, which was a new, already systematised, though rough version of all the parts of the future Capital.</p>
<p>In Marx's References, Arabic numerals indicate the pages of the notebooks.

<p>(p. 8) (the capacity to work as <i>capital</i>]). Wages not productive (I.e.). The exchange between capital and labour belongs to simple circulation, does not enrich the worker (9). Separation of labour and property, the premiss of this exchange (I.e.). Labour as object, absolute poverty; as subject, general possibility of wealth (9). Labour confronts capital without <i>particular</i> determinateness (9, 10). Labour process absorbed into capital (10) (11) (12, 13). (Capital and capitalist, 13.)</p>
<p><i>Production process</i> as content of capital (13 bottom).</p>
<p>Productive and unproductive labour (14). (Productive labour produces capital.)</p>
<p>The worker regards his labour as exchange value, the capitalist, as use value, etc. (14, 15). He divests himself of labour as power productive of wealth (15). (Capital appropriates it as such. I.e.) Transformation of labour into capital, etc. Sismondi. Cherbuliez. Say. Ricardo. Proudhon, etc. (15, 16).</p>
<p><i>Valorisation process</i> (17) (18). (Production costs. 19.) (SURPLUS VALUE not to be explained through EXCHANGE. <i>Ramsay. Ricardo</i>.) Capitalist cannot live off his <i>wages</i>, etc. (19: <i>faux frais de production</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> ). Mere self-preservation, non-multiplication of value contradicts the essence of capital (19, 20). Capital enters the production costs as capital. Interest-bearing capital. Proudhon (20). Surplus value. Surplus labour time (21) (22). Bastiat on wages (22). Value of labour. How determined? (22). Self-valorisation is self-preservation of capital. Capitalist may not live merely from his labour, etc. Conditions for the self-valorisation of capital. Surplus labour time, etc. (22, 23). To what extent capital is productive (as creator of surplus labour, etc.) (p. 23). This only historically transitory (I.e.). The free NIGGERS in Jamaica. Wealth made independent requires slave labour or wage labour (forced labour in both cases) (23).</p>
<p><i>Surplus value</i>. Ricardo (24). Physiocrats (24). A. Smith (24, 25). Ricardo (25, 26).</p>
<p>Surplus value and productive power. Relationship in their rise (26-28) (29-30). Result (30, 31). Productive power of labour is productive power of capital (31). In proportion as necessary labour is already diminished, the valorisation of capital becomes more difficult (30, 31). Concerning the expansion of the value of capital (32-38).</p>
<p>Labour does not <i>reproduce</i> the value of the material which, and of the instrument with which, it works. It <i>preserves</i> their value, simply by relating to them in the labour process as to its objective conditions. This animating and preserving force costs capital <i>nothing</i>; appears rather as its own force, etc. (pp. 38-40).</p>
<p>Absolute surplus time. Relative (40). It is not the <i>quantity</i> of living labour, but rather its <i>quality</i> as labour that simultaneously preserves the labour time already contained in the material, etc. (40). The change of form and substance in the immediate production process, 40, 41. It lies in the simple production process that the earlier stage of production is preserved through the later, etc. (41). Preservation of the old use value through the new labour, etc. (41).</p>
<p>[B"-30] Process of production and process of valorisation. The <i>amount</i> of objectified labour is preserved, because its <i>quality</i> as use values for further labour is preserved through contact with living labour (41, 42). In the real production process the separation of labour from the objective moments of its existence transcended. But in this process, labour is already incorporated into capital, etc. Appears as the self-preserving power of capital. Eternalisation of value (42). Capitalist obtains surplus labour gratis and the preservation of the value of material and instrument (42) (43). LABOUR, BY ADDING A NEW VALUE TO THE OLD ONE, AT THE SAME TIME MAINTAINS, ETERNISES THE LATTER (43). The <i>preservation</i> of values in the product costs capital nothing (43).</p>
<p>Through appropriation of current labour, the capital already possesses a draft upon (and respectively) appropriation of future labour (43).</p>
<p><i>Bastiat and Carey</i> (1-4). Bastiat on wages (5-7).</p>
<p><i>Notebook</i> <i>IV.</i> Confusion of profit and surplus value. Carey's wrong calculation (1).</p>
<p>The capitalist, who <i>does not pay</i> the worker for the <i>preservation</i> of the old value, further demands remuneration for allowing the worker to preserve the old capital (2). Surplus value and profit, etc. (2, 3).</p>
<p>Difference between consumption of the instrument and of wages. The former consumed in the production process, the latter, outside it (3).</p>
<p>Increase of surplus value and decrease of rate of profit (4-7. See especially 7+<i>Bastiat</i> ibid.).</p>
<p>Multiplication of simultaneous working days, etc. (7, 8) (<i>accumulation of capital</i>). Machinery (9).</p>
<p>Growth of the constant part of capital in relation to the variable part laid out on wages=growth of the <i>productivity of labour</i> (9). Proportion in which capital must increase, with increased productivity, to employ the same number of workers (9-12). Percentage [of surplus value] on the total capital can express very different proportions (12, 13).</p>
<p>Capital (like property in general) rests on <i>productivity of labour</i> (13, 14).</p>
<p>Increase of surplus labour time. Multiplication of simultaneous working days. (<i>Population</i>.) (14). Population can increase in proportion <i>as necessary labour time</i> becomes smaller ,or the time required for the production of living labour capacity relatively decreases (14). Surplus capital and surplus population (14, 15). Creation of free time for the society (15).</p>
<p>Transition of capital from the production process to the circulation process (15 <i>et seq</i>.). <i>Devaluation of capital itself owing to increase of productive forces</i> (15) idem, 15-21. (Competition, p. 21.) (<i>Capital</i> as unity and contradiction of production process and valorisation process) (22 <i>et seq</i>.). Capital as limit to production. Overproduction (22, 23) (demand of the labourers themselves) 24. Limits to capitalist production 24, 25. Overproduction 25-28. Proudhon 26, 27, 28. (How is it possible that, in the price of the commodity the worker buys, he pays the profit, etc., and still receives his necessary wages?) 29. Price of the commodity and labour time. Surplus, etc. 28-31. (Price and value, etc.) Capitalist does not sell <i>too dear</i>; but still above what the thing costs him (30, 31).</p>
<p>Price (<i>fractional</i>) (31). Bastiat. Fall in fractional price (31). Price can fall below value without detriment to capital (31, 32). Number and unit (measure) important for price (32).</p>
<p><i>Specific accumulation</i> of capital (transformation of surplus labour (revenue) into capital) (32). Proudhon. Value- and pricedetermination. In antiquity (slaves) not overproduction but overconsumption (32).</p>
<p>The general rate of profit (33).</p>
<p>If the capitalist sells only at <i>his</i> own production costs, <i>transfer</i> to other capitalists. The worker gains almost nothing thereby (34-36), especially 36.</p>
<p>[B"-31] Limit to capitalist production: ratio of surplus labour to necessary. Ratio of the surplus consumed by capital to the surplus converted into capital (38, 39).</p>
<p>Devaluation in crises (39, 40). Capital coming out of the production process becomes money again (40, 41).</p>
<p><i>Surplus labour or surplus value becomes surplus capital</i>. All the conditions of capitalist production now appear as result of (wage) labour itself (42, 43). The process of the realisation of labour at the same time the process of its de-realisation (43) (44).</p>
<p>Formation of surplus capital I (44, 45). Surplus capital II (45). Inversion of the right to appropriate (45).</p>
<p>Chief result of the production- and valorisation-process; the reproduction and new production of the very relationship of capital and labour, of capitalist and worker (45, 46).</p>
<p><i>Primitive accumulation of capital</i>, 45, 46. (The real accumulation, ibid.)</p>

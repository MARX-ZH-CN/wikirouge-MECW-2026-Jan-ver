JENNY MARX TO PETER IMANDT</p>
<p>IN DUNDEE</p>
<p>[London, around 13 June 1871]<br>1 Maitland Park Road</p>
<p>My dear Mr Imandt,</p>
<p>I have just received your letter and make all haste to let you know that Moor is 'ALL RIGHT'. The rumours are just a lot of police fabrications which Stieber has invented in league with those French scoundrels.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>You will be receiving COPIES of the Address of the International<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>today. Perhaps you can arrange for something from it to appear in the press. The girls<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>have been with Laura for the past 6 weeks.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>They were in Bordeaux at first. But then things got too hot for Lafargue. They made their escape from there and are now close to the Spanish border; SAFE, I hope.</p>
<p>Your brother also wrote briefly yesterday about Moor's arrest. Please tell him what you know. I have my hands full today.</p>
<p>You cannot imagine, dear Mr Imandt, what we have been through, all the misery and anger, during the last few weeks. It took more than 20 years to develop such brave, able, heroic men, and now almost all of them are lost. There is still hope for some, but the best have been murdered. Varlin, Jaclard, Rigault, Tridon.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>And above all the true heroes, who fought on without leaders for 8 days in Villette, Belleville and St Antoine<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>: workers, both men and women!!<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>The despicable loudmouths like Félix Pyat will probably save their skins. Others are still in hiding, but I am afraid that the bloodhounds will hunt them down.</p>
<p>With best regards.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Jenny Marx

A statement to this effect appeared in<i> The Pall Mall Gazette,</i> No. 1970, 7 June 1871, in the article 'The Interregnum'. Marx replied with a letter to the editor of<i> The Pall Mall Gazette</i> exposing this falsehood (see present edition, Vol. 22, p. 360).</span>

Early in August, fearful of persecution, Lafargue left for Spain and Laura followed him. Jenny and Eleanor were arrested in Luchon and later expelled from France. On this see K. Marx, 'Letter to the Editor of <i>The Sun,</i> Charles Dana' and Jenny Marx's Letter to the Editor of<i> Woodhull &amp;  Claflin's Weekly</i> (present edition, Vol. 22, pp. 396-99, 622).</span>

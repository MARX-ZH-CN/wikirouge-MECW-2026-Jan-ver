ENGELS TO JULIUS MOTTELER
<br>IN LONDON
<br>[London,] 21 July 1894
<br>Dear Julius,
<br>Herewith a letter from Siegel which I have been asked to pass on to you.
<br>I have written to the Executive Committee about the 300 marks. Should you be able to do something in the Club here, or anything else for the chaps, it would be a good deed; in the meantime I have sent them a pound.
<br>Kindest regards to your wife. Our house is in mourning, the canary hen having died while sitting on her four eggs—from a stroke, it would seem.
<br>Yours,
<br>F.E.

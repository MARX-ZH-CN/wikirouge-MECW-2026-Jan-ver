ENGELS TO JULIUS MOTTELER</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 21 July 1894</p>
<p>Dear Julius,</p>
<p>Herewith a letter from Siegel which I have been asked to pass on to you.</p>
<p>I have written to the Executive Committee about the 300 marks. Should you be able to do something in the Club here, or anything else for the chaps, it would be a good deed; in the meantime I have sent them a pound.</p>
<p>Kindest regards to your wife. Our house is in mourning, the canary hen having died while sitting on her four eggs—from a stroke, it would seem.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F.E.

<p><i>To Conrad Schramm in St Hélier in Jersey</i>
</p>

<p>Dear Schramm,</p>
<p>Write soon and tell us how Jersey suits you. I did not see Engels when he passed through London on his return journey because he gave me the wrong time for our meeting at the <b>railway station</b>. Did that ass Reventlow reply? Not that I suppose there's anything at all to the whole affair, since in any case these <b>Americans</b> are incapable of paying just now; I only ask because of the <b>behaviour</b> of this mighty hero. And how about Mr Faucher? Has he paid up yet? That <b>crazy</b> <i>Berlinois</i> <b>grows from day to day stupider. Witness the foreign news of <i>The Morning Star</i></b>, a name that bears a certain analogy with <i>lucus a non lucendo</i>. In fact the entire English press gets worse every day, even without German assistance. Quite apart from the seismic effects of the <b>general crisis</b> which must delight every connoisseur, it is truly a relief when one is no longer forced to listen every day to the <b>English self-laudations as to the 'bravery' of 'their English in India'.</b> It was really getting on one's nerves, * this overtrading in other people's courage on the part of the English paterfamilias and penny-a-liner who lives quietly at home and is uncommonly averse to anything threatening him with the remotest chance of obtaining military glory *.</p>
<p>Apart from the family circle, I am now pretty well cut off here. I seldom see my few acquaintances nor, on the whole, is this any great loss. The life you lead in Jersey can hardly be much quieter. I fear that as time goes on you will weary of your stay, or have you struck up acquaintanceships <b>of any kind</b>? True, Harney is <b>so far</b> quite a companionable fellow, but <i>toujours perdrix</i> is, of course, apt to pall. I hope to see you again in the spring, provided you don't move further south. In any case <b>drop one or two lines</b>.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i>.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.

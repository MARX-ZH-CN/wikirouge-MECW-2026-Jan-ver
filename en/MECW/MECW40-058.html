MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>London, 9 April 1857</p>
<p>9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park,</p>
<p>Haverstock Hill</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>You must excuse me for being so late in answering. For a fortnight my wife has been in worse health than for many months</p>
<p>past, and there has been great TROUBLE in the house. Be so good as to let me have Dana's letter back.</p>
<p>I am sending you through the parcels company a small bottle of eye lotion. Cornelius brought me a bottle of it from Paris, where he had had trouble with his eyes. For several weeks I had myself been suffering from inflammation of the eyes due to intensive work at night. The lotion put me right within a few days and will do you a similar service. All you have to do is put a few drops into the bad eye on getting up and on going to bed.</p>
<p>Conrad Schramm has died in Philadelphia of a chest complaint. I hear that in New York the <i>Neue Zeit</i> announcing his death has published an obituary of sorts. I haven't yet seen it.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The apparent improvement on the Stock Exchanges is again petering out. Bank rate is rising again. Crédit mobilier<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and French <i>rentes</i> are again going DOWN, while revelations of commer- cial sharp practice by joint stock companies in London and Paris are becoming increasingly frequent. In the latter place, I'm glad to say, the government is directly involved. You have, I sup- pose, read about the row between Péreire and Féline? I'd have copied it out for you had I not assumed that <i>The Manchester Guardian's</i> [woman] correspondent CHRONICLES everything of that nature. I now see the Paris <i>Figaro</i> from time to time, the only <i>real</i> journal of the Empire; it has cast off all semblance of respectability.</p>
<p>I don't know whether I have already drawn your attention to the two new pieces of evidence against Pam. First, Herbert told his CONSTITUENTS in <i>South Wilts</i>;<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> that he had given orders for the bombardment of Odessa<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> upon his resigning, Pam sent an order written with his own hand to SPARE it. Secondly, Russell told the City electorate<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> that Palmerston had given him written instructions on how to conduct himself at the Congress of Vienna,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>instructions which Clarendon forbade him to make public and in the execution of which LITTLE JOHN so splendidly BROKE DOWN. It's typical of old Pam to keep harping in <i>his</i> newspapers on Herbert's Odessa TREASON (it was Pam's popular rag, the <i>Advertiser,</i> that first drew attention to Herbert's family ties with Vorontsov<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> ) and on Russell's Vienna TREASON.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>I shall search out more anti-Palmerstoniana for you. Pam's speech against Anstey (a fat pamphlet) ought to be in my possession if Pieper hasn't pinched it from me. Lengthier works are Parish, <i>Diplomatic History of Greece</i> and Urquhart, <i>Central Asia.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> On the first topic you might also read the EXPOSITIONS by Thiersch<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> and Maurenbrecher<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> which came out in 1836 (?). (It's a long time since I set eyes on them.) Of all the <i>Blue Books,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> the one that has impressed me most strongly is that on the second Syro-Turkish War.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>I've only had 5 articles in <i>The Free Press.</i>?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup> Liebknecht, etc., have filched them from me. However I'll get them together for you. In the last one I used the text of one of your articles, in which you speak of Peter I. I've only just completed the introduction. But at first the chaps dragged their feet for months. Later, they brought it out rather more quickly. But now, when the first payment is due, I dun them in vain. If they don't do better on this POINT than hitherto, I shall have to sever the CONNECTION ALTOGETHER. They have given me a new contract, but what good is a contract to me if they don't abide by it <i>in puncto puncti</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>Regards to Lupus. Tell him that in Grimm<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup> I have found the scientific derivation of Farina, the Eau de Cologne manufacturer, viz. Sanscrit: <i>vâri</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup> —Gen. <i>vârinas.</i>

The Crédit mobilier was to mediate in credit transactions and help in setting up  industrial concerns and building railways in France, Spain, Austria, Russia and  other countries. It was closely associated with Napoleon Ill's government and  under its protection engaged in large-scale speculation. It went bankrupt in  1867 and was liquidated in 1871.—34, 68, 119, 126, 128, 133, 142, 145, 216,  225, 231, 240, 244, 291, 296, 349, 360, 437</span>

<li id="cite_note-14"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-14">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">This refers to a work planned by Marx on the history of British and Russian  diplomacy in the eighteenth century, of which he only completed five chapters  of the Introduction. For these he made use of pamphlets, diplomatic  documents and unpublished manuscripts, mostly of the period of the Northern  War (the Russo-Swedish war of 1700-21), which he found in the British  Museum Library. His negotiations with Nikolaus Trübner for publication of the  work ended in failure. The chapters of the Introduction appeared by  instalments in Urquhart's<i> Sheffield Free Press</i> from late June to early August 1856  as they were sent in by Marx. Eventually publication was stopped because of  arbitrary editorial abridgements and printing errors. In June 1856 the London  <i>Free Press</i> began reprinting the text from the Sheffield paper, and on 16  August 1856 it started reproducing the chapters from the beginning, with  publication continuing until 1 April 1857. In both papers the unfinished work  was printed under the title<i> Revelations of the Diplomatic History of the 18th  Century</i> (see present edition, Vol. 15).  In 1899 Eleanor Aveling, Marx's daughter, published it in London in book  form under the heading<i> Secret Diplomatic History of the Eighteenth Century.</i>—46,  56, 73, 81, 94, 110, 112, 120</span>

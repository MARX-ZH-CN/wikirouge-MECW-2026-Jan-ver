MARX TO FERDINAND FREILIGRATH
<br>IN LONDON
<br>[London, about 30 November 1859]
<br>Dear Freiligrath,
<br>I am neither Liebknecht's letter-writer, nor his ATTORNEY. I shall, however, send him a copy of that part of your letter which relates to him.
<br>I have decided against the statement I had briefly envisaged, bearing in mind that <i>odi profanum vulgus et arceo</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> While the statement was certainly <i>against</i> Beta, it was for that very reason bound to be also <i>about</i> you, as you will have seen from the SUMMARY. If only for that reason, I gave you notice of it, quite apart from the intimacy in which your family and his appear in his <i>opusculum</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>You find it unpleasant to have your name mixed u p in the Vogt affair. I don't give a d a m n for Vogt and his infamous lies in the Biel <i>Handels-Courier</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> but I will not have my name used as a mask by democratic tricksters. As you know, if someone is forced to call upon witnesses, no other person can 'object' to being cited as a witness. In accordance with ancient English legal USE, RESTIVE WITNESSES may, <i>horribile dictu</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> actually be crushed to death.
<br>Finally, as regards party considerations, I am used to being treated on behalf of the whole party as target for mud-slinging by the press, and to seeing my private interests constandy damaged by party considerations; on the other hand, I am equally used to being unable to reckon on any kind of private consideration towards myself.
<br><i>Salut</i>
<br>Your
<br>K. M.

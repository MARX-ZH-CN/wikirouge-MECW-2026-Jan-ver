<br><i>To Engels in Manchester</i>
<br><b>[London,] 18 August 1869</b>
<br><b>Dear Fred</b>,
<br>Rather disappointed by <b>your letter</b>, since all had hoped to see you here this evening. The plan about Ireland is very good (Lizzie and Tussy will be able to admire the '<b>convicted'</b> <em>in natura</em>) if nothing new intervenes. This evening the Lafargue <b>family</b> arrives, leaving Dieppe today at 10 o'clock.
<br>The £10 received, but can't send <b>receipt</b> <em>before Saturday</em>, on which day there is a meeting of the sub-committee. The money is very welcome just before closing time.
<br>Yesterday Dupont announced that the French (or Paris) <b>trades unionists</b> (<b>Bronze Workers</b>) had paid back £45, i.e., sent it to him to pay back . This money was partly loaned and partly given to them years ago by the <b>unions</b> here through our mediation. (Even earlier, £20 was sent on our instructions from Paris to Rouen.) I have arranged that <em>députés</em> shall wait upon the <b>unions</b> here to appeal to their consciences when they pay in the money. — Incidentally, the Paris <b>unionists</b> have behaved very decently. Ditto, a letter arrived yesterday from Ludwig Neumayr, <em>de dato</em> Eisenach, with the following purport:

<blockquote>
<br>'At the congress in Eisenach, it was resolved that the workers of Germany should be called upon to join the International Working Men's Association by taking out cards as central members. Since I have now been appointed by Joh. Ph. Becker in Geneva as the agent of the German-language sectional groups of the international Working Men's Association for <em>Wiener-Neustadt</em> and surroundings, I would request exact instructions as to how I should now act. With social-republican fraternal greetings, etc. Address: Ludwig Neumayr, editor of the <em>Wiener-Neustadter Wochenblatt</em> in <em>Wiener-Neustadt,</em> Austria.

</blockquote>
<br>This is a blow to <b>Old</b> Becker and also, in particular, to the 'language-group <em>cash-box</em>'. But the matter itself may not be mucked about because of private friendship.
<br>You will recall <em>Werner</em> (bookbinder) of Leipzig, to whom I wrote from Manchester. Since then he has worked for us diligently.
<br>Yesterday the adherence of an (Italian) group from Trieste arrived. Ditto from <em>Barcelona</em>; I enclose a copy of the <em>organ</em> of this new group.
<br>In Posen — as Zabicki reported — the Polish workers (joiners, etc.) have victoriously ended a <b>strike</b> with the assistance of their colleagues in Berlin. This struggle against <em>Monsieur le Capital —</em> even in the minor form of a <b>strike</b> — will deal with national prejudice differently from the peace declamations made by bourgeois gentlemen.
<br><b>I hope to receive some lines from Tussy as to her state of health. My best compliments to Mrs Lizzie</b>.
<br>El Moro
<br>Much to be regretted is the sudden death of Sylvis (aged 41), President of the American Labor Union, just <em>before</em> the meeting of the <b>Labor Union Congress</b>, for which purpose he travelled across the United States agitating for nearly a whole year. Part of his work will thus be lost.

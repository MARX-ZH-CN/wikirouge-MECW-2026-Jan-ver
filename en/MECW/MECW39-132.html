To János Bangya in London</p>
<p>[Rough copy]</p>
<p>London, 3 December 1852<br>
28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Bangya,</p>
<p>I have today received from Engels a letter containing some highly curious pieces of information.</p>
<p>Engels has not written to the address indicated by you for, as he points out, what is actually proved by an answer to a letter that is sent not direct but only poste restante, through the medium of a 2nd address?</p>
<p>Instead, Engels asked some business friends in Berlin to make inquiries. After the most painstaking investigations they now tell him that:</p>
<p>1. no such firm as Collmann exists;
2. no Collmann exists at the address indicated, 58 or 59 Neue Königsstr. and
3. no one at all by the name of Collmann is to be found in Berlin.</p>
<p>Engels further draws my attention to the fact that the two letters signed Eisermann and the letter signed Collmann<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> were written by the same hand, that all 3 possess the unusual quality of being loose bits of paper bearing no postmark, that in the first 2 Eisermann, and in the 3rd Collmann, figures directly as publisher, etc., and that on pretexts that are mutually incompatible the thing has been allowed to drag on for nearly 7 months. Now that Collmann has proved to be as much of an illusion as was previously the non-existent publisher of the Constitutionelle Zeitung, Eisermann, I ask you yourself, how can all these contradictions, improbabilities and mysteries over something so simple as the publication of a pamphlet be rationally explained?</p>
<p>'Trust' will not dispose of facts, nor do people who respect one another demand unquestioning faith of one another.</p>
<p>I confess that, the more I turn this matter over in my mind, the more I am compelled, even with the best will in the world, to find it damned obscure; also that, were it not for my feelings of friendship towards you, I would unhesitatingly echo Engels' concluding remark: Après tout il paraît pourtant qu'on a voulu nous jouer.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>K. Marx</p>
<p>P.S. Engels finally draws my attention to the fact that, even were the manuscript in question to reappear for a few days in London,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> absolutely nothing would be proved and nothing gained. What could it prove, save the existence and identity of the manuscript, of which nobody is in doubt.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </p>

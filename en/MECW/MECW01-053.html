<p>In the year eighteen hundred and eighteen, on the <i>seventh day</i> of the month of <i>May</i>, at <i>four</i> o'clock in the <i>afternoon</i>, there appeared before me, registrar of births, marriages and deaths at <i>Trier</i> burgomaster's office in <i>Trier</i> district, <i>Herr Heinrich Marx</i>, domiciled in Trier, aged <i>thirty-seven,</i> by profession <i>barrister of the Higher Court of Appeal</i>, who showed me a <i>male</i> child and stated that the said child had been born in <i>Trier</i>, on the <i>fifth</i> day of the month of <i>May</i> at <i>two</i> o'clock in the <i>morning</i>, to <i>Herr Heinrich Marx</i>, barrister by profession, domiciled in <i>Trier</i>, and his wife <i>Henriette Presborck</i>, and that they wished to give the name <i>Carl</i> to this their child. After the aforesaid showing of the child and the above statement made in the presence of two witnesses, namely: <i>Herr Carl Petrasch</i>, aged <i>thirty-two</i>, by profession <i>government secretary</i>, domiciled in <i>Trier</i>, and <i>Mathias Kropp</i>, aged <i>twenty-one</i>, by profession <i>office employee</i>, domiciled in <i>Trier</i>, had taken place, I drew up in writing in the presence of the exhibitor of the child and the witnesses the present <i>certificate</i> on all this in double original, which after being read aloud were signed by the exhibitor of the child, the witnesses and myself.</p>

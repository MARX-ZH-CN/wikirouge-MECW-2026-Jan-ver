ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 25 April 1869</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Most useful for your liver would be a change of air and a change of your set habits. So do the right thing straight away: take a train immediately, and come here for a week or two. I have made myself quite a lot of spare time, and we shall be able to take vigorous walks together. Then you will be able to have Gumpert examine and treat you and, out of deference for your 'condition', you will be able to turn down invitations to 'tea'. You will then be fresh and ready for work in a short time again, to do more work in a few weeks than you can in your present condition. So telegraph me tomorrow to the WAREHOUSE which train you are coming on, and be here by the evening. That is the simplest and will <i>certainly</i> cure you.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

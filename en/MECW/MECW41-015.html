ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>[Manchester,] 4 February 1860
<br>D. M.,
<br>One keeps changing one's mind every night as is inevitable, since we've not yet set eyes on the stuff.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>The Hirsch affair is truly splendid.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>The lawsuit in Berlin also strikes me as a very good idea, always assuming they allow it, though I don't see how they can deny you justice/
<br><i>Re</i> Lupus'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> and the affair in general, I waded through the better part of the records for 1850/52 yesterday evening. Lupus cannot recollect anything at all and I have to keep jogging his memory. Not that I'm much better; since those days so much BITTER BEER has flowed down my gullet that many things are difficult to ascertain. As regards Lupus the following emerges:
<br>1. In 1851, <i>not 1850,</i> when the document appeared in the <i>Karlsruher Zeitung</i> (our plan of campaign against the democrats<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> ), Lupus was still in Zurich<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> <i>and was attacked by the fellows as one who happened to be in their midst and was a member of </i>our<i> League.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> </i>
<br>2. Another document, however, had appeared previously in, if I'm not mistaken, the <i>Hannoversche Zeitung,</i> namely a circular from the Cologne Central Authority composed by Bürgers.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> But I can't ascertain exactly whether it happened in the <i>Hann. Ztg.</i> You must go into this.
<br>3. Vogt has jumbled all of this up and has Lupus writing a document in <i>London</i> in 1850 which was produced in <i>Cologne</i> at a time when Lupus was still in Zurich. (L. came to London after 5 May and before 21 July 1851.) All that remains to be ascertained is whether Bürgers' document really did appear in the <i>Hann. Zeitung,</i> and how it fell into the hands of the Hanover police. The letters I wrote you between February and April 1851 are bound to contain some mention of it.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> Let me have particulars about this; without them I hardly imagine that Lupus' statement<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> will suffice.
<br>The item in <i>The Times</i> (original source Augsburg <i>Allgemeine Zeitung)</i> had already been noted.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> <br>I am starting on my thing<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> today. Up till now, the Vogt rumpus has prevented me from doing so. This time I shall again describe myself as the 'author of <i>Po and Rhine'</i> so as to get that personage all the more firmly established in the field of military literature— if I put my own name to it <i>the immediate result would be a conspiration du silence.</i> At the same time, however, i.e. about a fortnight after it comes out, I shall get Siebel to arrange for an appropriate review to appear in the papers. In general, this fellow could be very useful to us in the Vogt rumpus; he has masses of connections.
<br>Many regards to the FAMILY.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

The pro-Bonapartist content of this statement was exposed by Engels in the pamphlet <i>Savoy, Nice and the Rhine</i> (present edition, Vol. 16) and by Marx in <i>Herr Vogt</i> (present edition, Vol. 17, p. 195).</span>

ENGELS TO AN UNKNOWN CORRESPONDENT</p>
<p>London, 29 November 1892</p>
<p>122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>My dear Charlie,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your nice letter and good wishes which I hope may all be fulfilled and as you have done me the honour of being born on the same day as myself, please accept my best congratulations on <i>your</i> birthday and the wish that you may live to be twice as old as I am now. Then you are sure to see something very grand and, worth seeing, and then perhaps you will now and then think of me as one who tried his best to bring about such a change.</p>
<p>With kind regards to your parents and brothers and sisters</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>F. Engels
</p>

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 8 November 1865
1 Modena Villas, Maitland Park,
Haverstock Hill</p>
<p>Dear FREDERICK,</p>
<p>I arrived here on Friday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>evening. Strohn had pressed me very strongly to spend some days with him, but I had too much on my mind. I knew things were awry in London and thus wanted to be on the spot.</p>
<p>The DISAPPOINTMENTS MRS Lizzy<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>prophesied for me came true with a vengeance. <i>D'abord,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>on arrival at King's Cross,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>my case had gone, and I still have not got it back even now, which is particularly annoying because of the 'papers' it contained, for which I am responsible. Then I found my child<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>was still very unwell. Finally, the LANDLORD had been round, had made threats, and my wife had only calmed him down with <i>promises of my return.</i> The man talked of putting the <b>BROKER</b> into the house and also of terminating the LEASE, which the contract admittedly entitles him to do. All the other riff-raff appeared in the LANDLORDS wake, some of them in person, and some in the form of threatening letters. I found my wife so DESOLATE that I <i>had not the COURAGE</i> to explain the TRUE STATE OF THINGS to her. And I <i>really do not know what to dol</i> And we also have to get coals in, etc.</p>
<p>As well as these DISAPPOINTMENTS ONE GOOD NEWS. One of the two aunts in Frankfurt (the one who is 73,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>the other<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>is two years younger) has passed on, but <i>ab intestato</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>(being afraid of dying if she should make a will). I shall therefore have to share with the other heirs, which would not have been so if there had been a will, as she cared nothing for the others. And then another pleasant circumstance—we have to wait for the power of attorney from Mr Juta from the CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.</p>
<p>All these pleasant circumstances have rather gone to my stomach, so that I at once had myself made up some more of Gumpert's medicine.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i> (to MRS Lizzy, too).</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

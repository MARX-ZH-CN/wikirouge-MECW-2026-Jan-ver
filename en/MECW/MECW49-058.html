ENGELS TO GEORG SCHUMACHER<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN SOLINGEN</p>
<p>[London, December 1890]</p>
<p>My dear Schumacher,</p>
<p>Since you will now be at home, I am taking the opportunity of asking you to convey my warmest thanks to my friends in Solingen for the beautiful present they gave me on my 70th birthday. But at the same time, I wish to thank you, too, for your contribution to the parliamentary group's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>magnificent present.</p>
<p>As a boy, whenever I saw a knife like this, I would gaze at it admiringly and envy the owner of a tool so suited to all manner of uses. Now, in my old age, one such has come into my possession, and in such a fashion to boot, and with so honourable an inscription.</p>
<p>As you know, since 1849 my attachment to Solingen has been of a very special kind, since the time, that is, when I, along with the Solingen volunteers, marched to Elberfeld where, confronted by a reactionary civic militia, unorganised Elberfelders and a highly reactionary security committee, I could not have remained unscathed for three days if it had not been for the Solingeners who, almost alone amongst those taking part, represented the revolutionary element.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>And, since I am anxious that those ties attaching me to Solingen should not be allowed to slacken or break, it is a very special pleasure to note that in Solingen I, too, am still remembered.</p>
<p>With warm regards to you and to all the members of the party from your old friend,</p>
<p>F. Engels

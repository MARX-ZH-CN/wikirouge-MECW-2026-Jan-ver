<br>Dear Hess,
<br>As you see, I am no longer writing to you from Brussels. I shall remain here until 10 August and shall probably be leaving Brussels for Paris on the 11th. Marx has sent your letter on to me here. I shall gladly do my utmost to smuggle your wife across the border, but all the same it's unfortunate that she should not have a passport. As I had already left Brussels a few days before her arrival, I know nothing of the whole affair except what you tell me in your letter. As I have said, I will do my utmost.
<br>Your
<br>Engels
<br>

<br>Dear Hess,
<br>In forwarding you these lines from Engels, I would only add that your wife is <em>quite cheerful.</em> Seiler is her squire and has introduced her to Vogler and wife, with whom she consorts almost daily. My wife cannot do very much as she is very unwell and mostly has to keep to her bed.
<br>Your<br>M.
<br><br>
I was just about to send this letter off when I read your announcement about Ruge in the <em>Kölnische Zeitung</em> [M. Hess, 'Erklärung', Kölnische Zeitung, No. 209, 28 July 1846, supplement, announcing Hess' forthcoming article on A. Ruge]. Since the printing of our stuff may be much delayed, I would advise you to get back your article on Ruge.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> You will be able to use nearly all of it.
<br>I wrote and asked the Westphalians [J. Meyer and R. Rempel] to send the manuscript to Daniels.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> If he has not yet got it, arrange for the article on Ruge to be sent by them direct to you.
<br>What sort of a book is this of Heinzen's [K. Heinzen's collection Die Opposition with A. Ruge's articles 'Der teutsche Kommunismus' and 'Der Rabbi Moses und Moritz Hess']? And what does Dottore Graziano write about you? Write and tell me.
<br>[on the back of the letter in Karl Marx's and Jenny Marx's handwriting]
<br>Mr M. Hess in Cologne<br>Hand to Mr Gottschalk, M. D.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Marx writes here about the advance which Hess had probably already received from Meyer and Rempel for his collaboration in preparing the quarterly planned by Marx and Engels. Hess wrote articles on A. Ruge ('Dottore Graziano, der Bajazzo der deutschen Philosophic') and G. Kuhlmann ('Der Dr. Georg Kuhlmann aus Holstein oder die Prophetic des wahren Sozialismus') for the first two volumes of the quarterly. Later Hess tried in vain to have the first article published separately, and finally, on 5 and 8 August 1847, it was printed in the <em>Deutsche-Brüsseler-Zeitung</em> under the title 'Dottore Grazianos Werke. Zwei Jahre in Paris. Studien und Erinnerungen von A. Ruge'. The article on G. Kuhlmann, edited by Marx and Engels, was included in <em><a class="mw-redirect" german="" he="" href="MECW05-006.html" ideology"="">The German Ideology</a></em> and published as Chapter V of Volume 11.</span>

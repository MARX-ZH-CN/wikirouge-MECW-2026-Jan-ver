<br><b>Dear Fred</b>,
<br>Luckily the congress ends today and up to Thursday — that is as far as the news goes — it had only compromised itself tolerably. But one must always fear some public disgrace, since the Belgians form the enormous majority. Mr Tolain and other Parisians want to have the <b>General Council</b> moved to Brussels. They are very <b>jealous of</b> London. It is a great step forward that the Proudhonist '<em>braves Belges'</em> and French, who dogmatically declaimed against <b>trades unions</b>, etc., in Geneva (<em>1866</em>) and Lausanne (<em>1867</em>), are now most fanatically in favour. In spite of all their boasting, the '<em>braves Belges'</em> had made no preparations. For example, the correspondent of <em>The Daily News</em> hunted in vain for 3 days for the possible meeting place until he accidentally ran into Jung and Stepney. In fact, the premises had not been booked in advance, and the '<em>braves Belges'</em> wanted to charge the expenses (among others, those for their 250 participants) to the London <b>General Council</b>, to which they and the French owe about 3,000 frs. The sum is now being raised by private collections among the delegates.
<br>I am in a bad scrape. Laura has fallen sick since you were here, and my wife was forced to borrow £10 from her simply to meet the extra expenses, as we are absolutely broke.
<br>I have heard nothing at all from Holland and must therefore regard the silence as intentional. I really do not know what to do.
<br>Apropos. It was a good thing that we changed the word <b>convicts</b> into <b>victims</b>.
<br>On the return of Shaw — who was sent at Moore's expense — the latter will receive his <b>receipt</b><em>.</em>
<br><em>Salut</em>.
<br>Your<br>K. M.

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 6 March 1866</p>
<p>Dear FRED,</p>
<p>As it seems decided I am to go away, I think it is best to go to Margate. The air is particularly good there. Besides, not far from London in case anything were to happen. And although the last carbuncle has also disappeared, the wound has not healed up yet, so lengthy train journey would be awkward for me.</p>
<p>Now what ought I to do 'AT LARGE'?—according to Gumpert's prescriptions?</p>
<p>I am going out into the open air again for the first time today.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

ENGELS TO HENRI BRISSAC</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London, after 7 April 1892]</p>
<p>Dear Citizen,</p>
<p>I have just received your letter of the 7th inst. (postmarked yester- day). I am still awaiting the pamphlet<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>you were good enough to send me. I shall read it with interest. But I greatly regret that it will be impossible for me to render you the service you ask of me.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>In the first place, if I were to write <i>on your behalf a</i> criticism of your work for publication, courtesy might, perhaps, preclude my speaking freely. Moreover, whatever I might do for you I should also be obliged to do for every other <i>bona fide</i> socialist, be he French, German, English, Italian, Spanish, Danish, etc., etc., and what would that lead to? I shouldn't have a single moment to call my own. And more impor- tant than any other consideration is the fact that I have before me a very difficult task which has been weighing on my conscience for years, namely the editing of Volume III of Marx's <i>Capital.</i> Several months ago I made a resolution not to take on any additional work whatsoever until I had discharged this urgent duty.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely
</p>

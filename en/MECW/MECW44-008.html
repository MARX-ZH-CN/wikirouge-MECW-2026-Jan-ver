MARX TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT</p>
<p>IN LEIPZIG</p>
<p>[London,] 29 July 1870</p>
<p>Dear Library,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Enclosed an extract from the Manifesto of the General Council taken from <i>The Pall Mall Gazette</i> of 28 July.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Be so good as to insert a note in your <i>translation</i> in the <i>Volksstaat</i> that you received the Manifesto in <i>English.</i> This will indicate to our other correspondents that we had no time to send them translations.</p>
<p>Last Tuesday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> I translated the Reichstag protest of Bebel and yourself into English for the General Council. It was received with great acclamation.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>One further matter. Mr Karl Blind made a patriotic speech to a German meeting in the Sports Hall; this comedian represented as a vital, world-shaking event the fact that he, the German Brutus, had suspended his republicanism, sacrificing it on the altar of the fatherland for the duration of the war. That was Act I.</p>
<p><i>Act II:</i> Karl Blind gives an account in his own hand in the London <i>Deutsche Post</i> of that same meeting, whose size, importance, etc., he exaggerates in his usual manner.</p>
<p><i>Act III:</i> Karl Blind writes an <i>anonymous</i> letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> to <i>The Daily News,</i> in which he movingly depicts the overwhelming impact on the whole of Germany of the great speech made by <i>Karl Blind</i> at the meeting in the Sports Hall. All the German papers, he claims, have reproduced it. One of them, the Berlin <i>Volks-Zeitung,</i> even <i>ventured</i> (!) to print it in its entirety. (The fellow is a correspondent of the <i>Volks-Zeitung.</i>) Neither did Viennese papers allow the great event to pass them by without trace. (The fellow sent in a report himself to the <i>Neue Freie Presse.</i>)</p>
<p>This is just one of a thousand instances in which this ant-lion strives to gull the English into believing that he is a sort of German Mazzini.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

On 26 July 1870, Marx read their declaration in the General Council of the International, which unreservedly approved their action. The declaration was translated into English by Marx and published in <i>The Bee-Hive Newspaper</i> on 6 August 1870 in the report on the General Council meeting.</span>

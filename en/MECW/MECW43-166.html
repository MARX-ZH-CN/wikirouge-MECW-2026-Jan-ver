ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 4 March 1869</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>I must leave it quite up to you to do what you think best about the article.<sup>0</sup> For my part, I do <i>not</i> think that the article would have any sort of effect in Liebknecht's paper<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> in instalments of 1 or 2 columns, since it would thus be spread over <i>two years.</i> On the other hand, if he wanted to print it <i>cheaply for</i> the workers, this would be different and could have an impact. Since he is now involved in a row with Schweitzer,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I would suggest to him that he publish the last section of my pamphlet on military questions<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> in his sheet, or ask Meissner the price at which he would allow him to sell the remainder (he once asked me about this through Moore, but as I have had no occasion to write to him since, this too has remained unanswered). If, however, he should reprint the article, he must indicate the source. I myself have <i>not got</i> a copy and you cannot part with yours either; we must keep one, after all!</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

In that statement, Liebknecht proposed to appoint the General Council the arbiter in the conflict between Schweitzer and his General Association of German Workers on the one hand, and Bebel, Liebknecht and the workers' unions they headed, on the other. The note that Schweitzer had refused to recognise the General Council as arbiter appeared in<i> Der Social-Demokrat,</i> No. 24, 24 February 1869.</span>

MARX TO HEINRICH OBERWINDER</p>
<p>IN VIENNA</p>
<p><i>[Draft]</i></p>
<p>London, 3 MARCH 1869</p>
<p>1 Modena Villas, Maitland Park,<br>
Haverstock Hill, N.W.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>You must forgive my delayed reply to your letter of 14 February, resulting from my indisposition.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>I do not need to assure you that I am greatly interested in the workers' movement in Vienna.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>If I could dispose freely of my</p>
<p><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>time and my strength, I would immediately stand at your disposal as a contributor to your paper. My ability to work is, however, continually interrupted by illness. The little leisure left me after completing the second volume of my work <i>Capital'<b><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></b></i><b> is absorbed by the business of the International Working Men's Association.</b></p>
<p>Thus, I cannot offer the prospect of contributions from me in the <i>near future.</i></p>
<p>I remain, with best respects<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Karl Marx

While working on the review, Engels wrote out excerpts from<i> Capital,</i> which later made up a synopsis (see Note 26). The review was written around 20 May-1 June 1868, but rejected by the editorial board (see present edition, Vol. 20).</span>

<li id="cite_note-5"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-5">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">After the first publication of<i> A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy </i> appeared in 1859, Marx produced a lengthy economic manuscript throughout 1861-63, which was a second rough draft of<i> Capital</i> (the first was the manuscripts of 1857-58). In 1863, he evolved the final plan for a four-book work, the first three books theoretical and the fourth, a historical and critical one. Having finished work on the manuscripts of 1861-63, Marx began preparing them for the press in August 1863.<br>This work from 1863-65 resulted in the third rough draft of<i> Capital,</i> three books of a theoretical character. The notes for the fourth book, the<i> Theories of  Surplus-Value,</i> were incorporated in the manuscripts of 1861-63. Later, having completed work on them, Marx went back to the first book. On Engels' advice, he decided it should appear first. Preparation for the press continued throughout 1866 and most of 1867. The first German edition of the first book appeared in September 1867 as Volume One of<i> Capital.</i> Under the plan agreed upon with Meissner, the publisher, the second and third books (devoted to the circulation of capital and the process of capitalist production as a whole) were to appear as Volume Two, while the fourth book on the history of economic theories was to be Volume Three of<i> Capital. </i><br>Marx, however, had not completed the preparation of the last books of<i> Capital</i> for the press. After his death, this was done by Engels, who published Marx's manuscripts relating to the second and third books as volumes Two and Three of<i> Capital</i> (1885 and 1894). Engels also intended to prepare for the press and publish as Volume Four of<i> Capital</i> the above-mentioned manuscript of the fourth book, but did not have time to do this in his lifetime. This edition presents this book of<i> Capital</i> as part of the<i> Economic Manuscripts of 1861-63, </i> (volumes 30-34) while Volumes One, Two and Three of<i> Capital</i> are to be found in volumes 35, 36 and 37 of the present edition respectively.</span>

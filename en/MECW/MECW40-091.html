MARX TO ENGELS
<br>IN RYDE
<br>[London,] 15 September [1857]
<br>Dear Engels,
<br>You must excuse my silence and non-ACKNowLEDGMENT of your various packages, due firstly to a great deal of work and secondly to numerous time-consuming errands in which 'inner compulsion' played no part whatever. I trust <i>your health continues to improve</i> despite the bad weather, and have still not abandoned the NOTION that you will be taking iron in the end. Only I'm afraid all this writing may be harmful to you.
<br>I expect a letter from Dana on Friday. Today I sent him 'Barclay', 'Berthier', 'Blum', 'Bourrienne' and your contributions.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> It is important that I should send off the 2nd lot of B's next week. I have certain queries to put to you in my next about the French generals who are next on my list. As to Bern's Polish DEEDS have found the following<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> :
<br>Distinguished himself at the battle of Iganin, when he engaged 40 Russian heavy calibre cannon with 12 light and 4 heavy guns, and subsequently at the battle of Ostrolenka.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Here he galloped his battery up to the line of Russian skirmishers, subjected the detachments which had crossed the Narev to devastating fire, withstood a hail of shot from 80 guns, and forced the enemy to withdraw. After this engagement promoted to colonel, shortly afterwards to command of the entire artillery and, when the Polish forces were concentrating at Warsaw, to general. During 5 and 6 September Bern committed all his guns to battle, siting his field pieces between the separate defensive works of the outer line. On the 6th, he advanced with 40 guns until he was just below Wola, already in Russian hands, but, having neither infantry nor cavalry in support, was compelled to retire. When the Polish army fell back on Praga during the night of the 7th, he occupied the bridge with 40 guns. On the morning of the 8th, however, he was informed of the agreement made with the Russians and of Malachowski's order to proceed with the artillery to Modlin. Cf. his memoir, <i>Allgemeine Augsburger Zeitung,</i> 1831, in which he discusses recent developments and attacks Krukowiecki.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> <br>I don't trust the above authority an inch and would therefore ask you to investigate and to do me a short, amended version of the passage concerned, if possible putting it straight into English. I shall look up the information you ask for at the Museum tomorrow.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> <br>Your
<br>K. M.

The majority of its participants were revolutionary gentry<i> (srdachta)</i> and its leaders came mostly from the aristocracy. It was suppressed by the Russian army with the support of Prussia and Austria. At the<i> battle of Iganin</i> on 10 May 1831 the Polish insurgents were victorious in a clash with Russian troops. At the<i> battle of Ostrolenka</i> on 26 May 1831 the Polish insurgents were defeated by Russian forces under Dibich. The final blow was delivered when the Russians captured Warsaw (see below) after storming its suburb Vola on 6 September. The remnants of the insurgent army fled to Prussia and Austria.—169, 172</span>

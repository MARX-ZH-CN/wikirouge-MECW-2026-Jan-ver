<p><i>To Jenny Marx in Trier</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 8 August 1856, 28 Dean Street, Soho</b></p>
<p>My one and only Sweetheart,</p>
<p>This morning, at the same time as your letter, I received a note from Frederic containing 15 talers for Lenchen. <i>Acknowledge it,</i> as he is most meticulous in such matters. More tomorrow; today I have the '<b>Immortal Collet',</b> here in the room with me and am keeping him in check by saying *'I am obliged to write some lines to Mrs Marx'*.</p>
<p><b>Lily-white, sandy</b> is settled <b>in reality</b><i>,</i> not <b>in fancy</b><i>.</i></p>
<p>Much though I hanker after you and the children — and this <b>quite</b> <i>indescribably —</i> I should like you to stay on in Trier <i>for another week.</i> It would do you and the children no end of good. More tomorrow.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.</p>
<p>P.S. The Urquhartites are being damned importunate. A good thing financially. But I don't know whether, <b>politically</b>, I ought to get too involved with the fellows. A thousand kisses, my beloved sweetheart.</p>
<p>P.S.II. Lina as got the famous post. Won't be taking it up <i>for weeks</i> yet.</p>
<p>It's ghastly for me, having to play the man of fashion <i>chez</i> Liebknecht now. <b>Hang it!</b> On top of that, I have Pieper sleeping with me in your stead. <b>Horrible</b>. In the same room, at any rate. <i>Engels is coming next week.</i> That's a relief. For 3 weeks I've been as hypochondriacal as the devil.

<br><i>To Jenny Marx in Trier</i>
<br><b>[London,] 8 August 1856, 28 Dean Street, Soho</b>
<br>My one and only Sweetheart,
<br>This morning, at the same time as your letter, I received a note from Frederic containing 15 talers for Lenchen. <em>Acknowledge it,</em> as he is most meticulous in such matters. More tomorrow; today I have the '<b>Immortal Collet',</b> here in the room with me and am keeping him in check by saying *'I am obliged to write some lines to Mrs Marx'*.
<br><b>Lily-white, sandy</b> is settled <b>in reality</b><em>,</em> not <b>in fancy</b><em>.</em>
<br>Much though I hanker after you and the children — and this <b>quite</b> <em>indescribably —</em> I should like you to stay on in Trier <em>for another week.</em> It would do you and the children no end of good. More tomorrow.
<br>Your<br>K. M.
<br>P.S. The Urquhartites are being damned importunate. A good thing financially. But I don't know whether, <b>politically</b>, I ought to get too involved with the fellows. A thousand kisses, my beloved sweetheart.
<br>P.S.II. Lina as got the famous post. Won't be taking it up <em>for weeks</em> yet.
<br>It's ghastly for me, having to play the man of fashion <em>chez</em> Liebknecht now. <b>Hang it!</b> On top of that, I have Pieper sleeping with me in your stead. <b>Horrible</b>. In the same room, at any rate. <em>Engels is coming next week.</em> That's a relief. For 3 weeks I've been as hypochondriacal as the devil.

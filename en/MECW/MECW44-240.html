ENGELS TO ADOLF HEPNER</p>
<p>IN LEIPZIG</p>
<p>London, 2 July 1872</p>
<p>Dear Hepner,</p>
<p>When mandates<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> are sent out it is absolutely essential to include one for Cuno, who is now in Belgium. He is of the greatest importance because of the Italian Bakuninists; these people will send nothing but lawyers and other doctrinaire bourgeois who play at being workers' representatives and who have done everything in their power to prevent the workers from corresponding with us directly. It was precisely Cuno who was the first to break through this barrier and, had he remained there, the whole problem would have been solved by now. Moreover, Cuno is one of our very best people; Liebknecht's entire mistrust of him is groundless and is based on his belief that Cuno was an agent of J. Ph. Becker, working in the interests of the Geneva 'Mother Section', something that never crossed Cuno's mind. I had to explain the whole absurd story to him later on since he knew nothing about the Mother Section.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> When I <i>know</i> what a man has <i>really accomplished,</i> I do not let myself be misled by such matters.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the Congress deliberations will be conducted in all 3 languages—German, English and French — so that ignorance of the two last languages need deter no-one.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Returning herewith <i>Boruttau's</i> letter.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> The man is assuredly honest, but terribly muddle-headed and driven on by an urge to perform deeds out of all proportion to his talents. These qualities make him a highly suitable DUPE for the Bakuninists who surround him and exploit him. If you read the <i>Bulletin de la Fédération jurassienne,</i> you will see that precisely now, before the Congress, these gentlemen are doing all they can to obtain private letters and so forth from us and to discover what material damaging to them we have in our possession.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> Apart from that the Boruttau letter is of no significance. It would not occur to us to do additional work for these gentlemen to our own detriment. If Boruttau is so unfamiliar with <i>notorious</i> facts which even Bakunin has never denied, it is not our responsibility to look up the issue of <i>Kolokol</i> where he can find it all, i.e. if he knows Russian, for if he doesn't, even referring him to the right issue will not help him.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> So much is certain: we <i>have</i> the material. Moreover, as long as 3 years ago Borkheim published more on this matter in his <i>Russische Briefe</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> than six Boruttaus could ask for. You would be well advised to tread warily with Boruttau. The magniloquent phrases of the Bakuninists have completely beguiled this muddle-head and this over-intense sort of honesty often turns into treachery in practice.</p>
<p><b>Scissions'.</b><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> The circular is <i>confidential</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> and so not intended for publication. We do not know how the (legitimist) <i>Courrier de France</i> in Paris—which is publishing it—obtained possession of it. Likewise with the <i>Radical,</i> which may have taken it from the <i>Courrier.</i> A German translation in the <i>Volksstaat</i> (which you would have to produce over there) would only be desirable if the bourgeois press in Germany makes a scandal of the affair—<i>but in that event it would be very desirable indeed</i> In the meantime the <i>Bulletin de la Fédération jurassienne</i> has publicly attacked it,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> so an article in the <i>Volksstaat</i> could do no harm. I assume that Liebknecht has left you the copy we sent him. If not, I shall send you one in a letter—a postal wrapper is impossible since the police have stolen everything I sent to Germany in that way.</p>
<p>Henri Perret, Temple Unique, Genève, has been instructed to <i>send the</i> ' <i>Volksstaat'</i> <i>50 copies for distribution in Germany.</i> If they have not yet arrived, please drop him a few lines.</p>
<p>I shall write to <i>Wigand</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> <b>Schulze-Bastiat</b>. Marx is buried up to his ears in work on the 2nd German edition<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> and the 1st French edition of <i>Capital</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>But even apart from this he would never agree to write an appendix to correct the blunders in such a completely unscientific book as Lassalle's.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup> He would have to correct almost the whole book. <i>Entre nous</i> if Marx ever does get around to correcting Lassalle there will be precious little of Lassalle left over. He has not done so up to now out of consideration for the many Lassalleans who have joined the Party, but one day it is sure to come.</p>
<p><b>The Housing Question</b>.</p>
<p>Liebknecht spoke of his intention of publishing my article<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup> on its own.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup> If this is the case, please let me have the galley proofs since there are a number of disastrous printing errors in it. There is also the following to be considered:</p>
<p>You write to me about <i>Sax.</i> Is it worthwhile writing a special article on a book<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup> which appeared in 1869? If so, I shall give the man a good hiding for you, and it would perhaps be a good idea to follow up the critique of the petit bourgeois solution to the housing problem with a critique of the grand bourgeois solution. In that event the two articles<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" id="cite_ref-18">[18]</a></sup> could be published together on their own, which would provide a more exhaustive treatment of the subject. Please let me know about this soon so that I may act accordingly.</p>
<p>I shall also produce a small article for you about the latest squabble in America.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" id="cite_ref-19">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F. E.

However, its contents and Marx's correspondence on the subject indicate that it was addressed to the heads of the Lachâtre publishing house in Paris. On 13 February 1872 Marx received a reply from the manager Juste Vernouillet, who informed him about the despatch of copies of the agreement on the publication of the French translation of Volume I of<i> Capital.</i> The agreement was signed on 15 February by Marx on one side, and Maurice Lachâtre and Juste Vernouillet on the other. It stipulated that the French edition was to be published in 44 instalments, and sold five instalments at a time. The French authorised edition of Volume I of<i> Capital</i> was published between 17 September 1872 and November 1875. The translation was done by Joseph Roy, who began in February 1872 and completed work in late 1873. The quality of the translation largely failed to satisfy Marx; besides, he was convinced that the original needed to be revised to adapt it to French readers.</span>

<p>To Adolf Cluss in Washington</p>
<p>[London, beginning of December 1851]</p>
<p>... One of our best friends, Joseph Weydemeyer, has now arrived in New York. Make contact with him straight away; I do not yet know his address. But if you send a letter to the <i>Staatszeitung</i> or the <i>Abendzeitung</i> it will no doubt reach him. He can enlighten you on all matters relating to the party. He will be useful to you in the gathering in New York<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>and you can help him to arrange his living in America. Write and tell him that I asked you to write to him....

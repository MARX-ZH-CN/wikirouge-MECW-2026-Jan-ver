<br><i>To Marx in Londo</i>n
<br><b>Manchester, 14 January 1858 7 Southgate</b>
<br>Dear Marx,
<br>Herewith the article, though it has just occurred to me that by a ludicrous slip I have written Wilson throughout instead of <em>Inglis</em>; perhaps you would alter this as there's no time to do so now.
<br>I shall do a few more C's for Tuesday, and finish 'Cavalry', which should make a good article and also be somewhat longer.
<br>Apropos, have you done 'Coehoorn' (Baron)? If not I have some excellent material.
<br>NB. I've <em>no material whatever</em> on '<em>Catapults</em>' — there should be something in Ersch and Gruber.
<br>The Lucknow garrison's greatest act of heroism consisted in the fact <b>that they had to face every day the 'coarse beef' cooked by the ladies</b>, '<b>entirely unaided</b>'. Must have been damned badly cooked. The <em>Daily News</em> has something on Windham, but not enough.
<br>Kindest regards to your wife and children.
<br>Your<br>F. E.
<br>My health is good. The sores have all been healed for the last 6 weeks. Heckscher is very satisfied with the way the thing is progressing, but he's still limiting what I eat and drink — not so much in quantity as in kind.

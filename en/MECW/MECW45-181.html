ENGELS TO MARX<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>IN LONDON
<br>[Ramsgate,] 31 July 1877
2 Adelaide Gardens
<br>Dear Moor,
<br>Just a couple of lines in great haste enclosing letter from W. Liebknecht which might perhaps influence your reply to the <i>Zukunft</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I haven't yet sent a straight answer, but have written to Liebknecht about the oddity of expecting us to entrust our manuscripts to totally anonymous persons because a congress has conferred a scientific character on them.<sup>3</sup>'<sup>4</sup> I further told him that
<br>I would write articles only in exceptional cases and when I myself considered it imperative.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <br>Wilhelm himself obviously doesn't know how things stand— otherwise he couldn't have made such a howler about Wiede. A fine way of setting up a scientific journal! Anyhow, it's a good thing there isn't any Dühringianism.
<br>I was delighted by the business of the strike in America.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> The way they throw themselves into the movement has no equivalent on this side of the ocean. Only twelve years since slavery was abolished and already the movement has got to such a pitch!
<br><i>Knies</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> is capital. Dühring, too, concerning whom you have again hit the nail on the head. What he ultimately says, in fact,— translated from confusion into economics — is that value is determined by wages.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> <br>Doubtless one will have to resign oneself to the Russians remaining between the Balkans and the Danube until the autumn. The Turks have allowed a very large proportion of their regular troops to succumb for want of proper provisioning during the fighting in Serbia and Montenegro,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> and Abdul Kerim has done his best to finish off the rest. I doubt whether Mehemet Ali has more than 50,000 men capable of an offensive; Osman Pasha will have some 25,000 and another 25,000 south of the Balkans; that would seem to be all, the remainder being untrained militia of no use in the field. Provided the Turkish government doesn't now conclude a premature peace, the Russians will not get to Constantinople this year, but probably cross the Danube again in November and, not having yet made any impression on the fortresses which—barring accidents—are therefore likely to con- tinue secure throughout this campaign, they can start from the beginning again in the spring—if at all.
<br>The wretched <i>Standard</i> correspondent in Constantinople is, at Layard's behest, disseminating alarmist rumours in order that the English fleet may be imposed on the Turks.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

<li id="cite_note-7"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-7">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">A reference to the French edition of the first volume of <i>Capital.</i> An attempt to translate Marx's principal work into French was first made by Charles Keller, a member of the Paris Section of the International. Between October 1869 and April 1870, he translated about 400 pages which he sent TO MARX for editing, After the defeat of the Paris Commune, however, Keller was forced to emigrate to Switzerland, where he embraced Bakuninist views, after which Marx terminated co-operation with him.
In December 1871, Paul Lafargue assisted Marx in concluding a contract for the publication of <i>Capital</i> with the progressive French journalist and publisher Maurice Lachâtre. The contract was signed on 15 February 1872. Under it, <i>Capital</i> was to appear in 44 instalments, one printer's sheet each. The work appeared between 1872 and 1875 in two instalments at a time, but was sold in series of five instalments each, making nine series in all.
The last instalments having come out, the series were stitched together and sold as separate books.
The first volume of <i>Capital</i> was translated into French by Joseph Roy. Marx did not think much of the effort and made a vast number of alterations, in fact, revised the book. As he himself said, the authorised French translation had an independent scientific value alongside the German original.
In this edition, the first volume of <i>Capital</i> is published in Engels' authorised English translation with the interpolations from the French edition given in the Appendix (see present edition, Vol. 35).</span>

<p>Haverstock-hill, N.W. June 30, 1871</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>I have declared in <i>The Daily News</i> — and you have reprinted in <i>The Pall Mall</i> — that I hold myself alone responsible for the charges brought forward against "Jules Favre and Co..</p>
<p>In your yesterday's publication you declare these charges to be "<i>libels</i>." I declare you to be a libeller. It is no fault of mine that you are as ignorant as arrogant. If we lived on the Continent, I should call you to account in another way. —</p>
<p>Obediently,</p>
<p><i><b>Karl Marx</b></i>

<p>MARX TO JOSEPH WEYDEMEYER<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN NEW YORK</p>
<p>London, 5 March 1852 28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Weywy,</p>
<p>I am afraid there has been a bit of a muddle because, HAVING MISUNDERSTOOD THY LAST LETTER, I addressed the last 2 packages to: Office of the <i>Revolution</i>, 7 Chambers' Street, Box 1817. What caused the confusion was that damned 'Box 1817', since you had written telling me to append this to the 'old address' without drawing any distinction between the first address and the second. But I hope the matter will have resolved itself before this letter arrives, the more so since last Friday's letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>contained the very detailed fifth instalment of my article. This week I was prevented from finishing the sixth, which is also the last one.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>If your paper is appearing again, this delay will not prove an obstacle since you have an ample supply of material.</p>
<p>Your article against Heinzen, unfortunately sent to me too late by Engels, is very good, at once coarse and <i>fine</i>, and this is the right combination for any polemic worthy of the name. I have shown this article to Ernest Jones and enclosed you will find a letter from him addressed to you, intended for publication.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>Since Jones writes very illegibly and with abbreviations, and since I assume that you are not yet an OUT-AND-OUT Englishman, I am sending you, along with the original, a copy made by my wife, together with the German translation; you should print them both, the original and the translation, side by side. Below Jones' letter you might add the following comment: As to <i>George Julian Harney</i>, likewise one of Mr Heinzen's authorities, he published our <i>Communist Manifesto</i> in English in his <i>Red Republican</i> with a marginal note describing it as 'THE MOST REVOLUTIONARY DOCUMENT EVER GIVEN TO THE WORLD',<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>and in his <i>Democratic Review</i> he translated the

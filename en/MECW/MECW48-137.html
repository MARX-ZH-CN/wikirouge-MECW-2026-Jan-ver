ENGELS TO FLORENCE KELLEY-WISCHNEWETZKY<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN NEW YORK</p>
<p>18 September 1888</p>
<p>Dear Mrs Wischnewetzky,</p>
<p>We returned on Saturday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> evening from our trip to Boston, Niagara, the St Lawrence, Adirondacks, Lakes Champlain and George, down the Hudson to New York City, we enjoyed ourselves very much and, all of us, brought home a stock of invigorated health which I hope will see us</p>
<p>well through the winter. To-morrow afternoon we are leaving per the <i>City of New York</i> and look forward to a little excitement, breakdowns of machinery and such like things, but hope to arrive, in spite of all, in 8-9 days in London. I cannot leave America without again expressing my regret that unfortunate circumstances prevented me from seeing you more than once and but for a few moments. There are so many things that we should have talked over together, but it cannot be helped and I shall have to go on board without taking leave of you personally. Anyhow I do hope that the troubles you have gone through lately<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> will be the last, that your own health and that of Dr Wischnewetzky and the children will be all you can wish for. I shall be glad to hear soon again from you, and all your wishes shall have my best attention.</p>
<p>I have some copies of the pamphlet<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> from Mrs Sorge, it is very cred- itably got up and so far I have discovered only two misprints. Please let me know how many copies you are sending me to England and how many I may distribute to the press; I believe it ought to be sent to <i>all</i> the chief dailies and weeklies in London and some in the provinces, also the monthlies. Of course, unless instructed to the contrary, I shall entrust the sale to Reeves. As he has accepted the agency for your American publication generally, his name might have been put on the title page; he will have to print a new title page and send in a bill for that.</p>
<p>Hoping to see Dr Wischnewetzky in London on his return, I remain, dear Mrs Wischnewetzky,</p>
<p>ever yours faithfully</p>
<p>F. Engels

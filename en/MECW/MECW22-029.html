<div class="Publication">Source : Marx-Engels Collected Works, Volume 22<br>Written on June 20 or 21, 1871<br>First published in: Marx and Engels, Works, First Russian Edition, Vol. XIII, Part II, 1940 <br>Reproduced from the rough manuscript</div>

<blockquote>
<p>Engels wrote this letter at Marx's suggestion because The Spectator and The Examiner reprinted the reports of the reactionary French press on the so-called manifestoes of the International, which were actually forged by the French police (see this volume, pp. 364-66). Marx's proposal to send a refutation to these papers was approved by the General Council at its meeting on June 20, 1871. The editors of the newspapers did not, however, publish the letter. This letter was first published in English in The General Council of the First International. 1870-1871, Minutes, Moscow, 1967, p. 423

<p>TO THE EDITOR</p>
<p>OF THE SPECTATOR (RESP. EXAMINER)
</p>
</center><p>Sir,</p>
<p>You will much oblige the General Council of the International Working Men's Association by giving publicity to the fact that all the pretended Manifestoes and other publications of the "Internationals" of Paris, with which the English Press is now teeming (and which all of them were first published by the notorious Paris Journal) are without one exception pure fabrications of the Versailles Police.</p>
<p><i>I am etc.</i>

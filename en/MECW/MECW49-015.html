ENGELS TO CHARLES CARON</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London, 20 September 1890]</p>
<p>Dear Citizen,</p>
<p>In reply to your letter of the 17th,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>I cannot give you the authorisation you ask for until I receive clarification on a number of points.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the first place it seems to me that, if any pamphlets are to be reissued, they should appear as complete and separate pamphlets and not in the form of a revue, each number of which would contain a mixed assortment of disconnected fragments of works that would, as often as not, contradict one another. Hence I should like, first of all, to be in a position to weigh up the reasons that have led you to prefer this latter form.</p>
<p>Again, is it not the intention of the Workers' Party to republish a large part of these same works in its <i>Bibliothèque socialiste?</i> If so, the party undertaking ought to take precedence over the private undertaking.</p>
<p>Lastly, you have yourself a pretty expensive task. It would take you from 4 to 6 months merely to complete the publication of the six pamphlets advertised<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>as commencing in your first number. Were the revue to cease appearing for want of funds midway through the publication of a work I had authorised you to reprint, a heavy responsibility would fall on my shoulders.</p>
<p>So have you the necessary funds? There are, in addition, further points to be considered. So as to settle the matter I would ask you to get in touch with Citizen Lafargue, to whom I have sent a copy of this letter.</p>
<p>I should be obliged if you would refer to me in future before using my name in public; indeed, as to the present instance, I reserve the right to have recourse, if I think fit, to measures of an equally public nature.

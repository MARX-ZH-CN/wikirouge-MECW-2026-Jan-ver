ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE</p>
<p>AT LE PERREUX</p>
<p>London, 4 April 1892</p>
<p>My dear Laura,</p>
<p>Today but two words to ask you to look after the <i>Eclair.</i>— On Friday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>morning all of a sudden Emile Massard came down upon me with a demand for an interview for that iridescent paper. As he promised to submit the ms. to my correction, and as I thought to be thereby able to put a flea in the ear of the Parisian <i>gogo,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>I consented. Yesterday I looked over the ms. and <i>almost entirely recast it.</i> Would you be good enough to send me about 4-6 copies of the paper as soon as it appears? If correct I shall want them for various regions, if incorrect, I shall at once protest against the breach of faith.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Anyhow this new experience with the eternal interviewing nuisance will help me to refuse in future, as I always have to do the real work (from 11 to 3 yesterday, instead of being out this warm weather) and even then it's not what I want and does not bring out my ideas. Damn the lot of them.</p>
<p>I was in Ryde for a week,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>has done me good. Pumps and the children are well, Percy has had influenza, pneumonia, pleurisy, inflamed throat, etc., one after the other and is only just recovering.</p>
<p>I am busy with an infernal preface<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>for the never-to-be-satisfied Swan Sonnenschein and Co. and that, as it will be long, will take me all week. As soon as finished you get a long letter.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i> to the travelling parliamentarian<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>who is not only a peripatetic grass widower but also a grasshopper, and love from Louise and yours</p>
<p>everlasting old</p>
<p>General</p>
<p>Next week we expect Bebel here unless stopped by ill health — he seems a deal out of sorts by overwork and overexcitement.

On 3 April he almost completely rewrote Massard's manuscript. The interview appeared in <i>Eclair</i> on 6 April. Judging by the fact that it was reprinted, even if abridged, in <i>Le Socialiste</i> (No. 82, 16 April), the newspaper of the French Workers' Party, it may be assumed that Engels regarded the <i>Eclair</i> text as satisfactory.</span>

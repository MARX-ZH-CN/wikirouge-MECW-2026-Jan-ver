<p>ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester, 2 May 1864] Monday evening 8.30</p>
<p>Dear Marx,</p>
<p>Lupus is going rapidly downhill. He's having hallucinations, keeps jumping out of bed, etc. What we're short of now is a man to sit up with him and stop him injuring himself. There is only one professional male nurse up here, and he is engaged. Admittedly, Borchardt could get hold of one from a nearby lunatic asylum, but so long as there is the slightest chance of recovery he doesn't, of course, want that kind of person, being anxious to avoid subsequent gossip and the harm it would do L. He now wonders whether you might perhaps have a reliable man, who <i>doesn't</i> need to be a <i>nurse</i> by profession, far better not, but is simply reliable in that he will do what he is told and not fall asleep—maybe you have such a man and can send him up here first thing tomorrow, for we are provided for only up till tomorrow and <i>periculum in mora.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> S'il s'en trouve,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> send him at once to Borchardt, Rusholme Road, Manchester.</p>
<p>If you have nobody, Borch. asks that you telegraph him first thing tomorrow (it costs a shilling), so that he and Gurapert can continue to look round up here.</p>
<p>I have just telegraphed you to this effect, but the present letter is necessary to an understanding of the telegram.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

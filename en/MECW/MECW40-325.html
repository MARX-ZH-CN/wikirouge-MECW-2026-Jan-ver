<p>My darling Karl,</p>
<p>I'm sorry I haven't anything better to send you than Sch['...] Koller's letter; I kept it back yesterday but maybe you ought to see it after all.</p>
<p>I hope that you will reach some definite <b>point of fact</b> with Friedländer; nothing much is ever to be got out of a German newspaper and it's beyond me how you could ask the enormous rate of £1 10/- for more than one article, especially since they have a correspondent for their regular <b>business</b>; they certainly can't want more than an <i>enjolivement</i>. The most that can be extracted from the <i>Presse,</i> as an <b>average maximum</b>, will be £2 — don't delude yourself on that score. Engels is sure to say 'you'll be able to make at least £10 a week out of it'; though such delusions may be very agreeable at the time, they are often doomed to disappointment in the event.</p>
<p>The course of the revolution in Prussia tickles me tremendously; particularly the 'ships, sails, masts and [waves]' speech made by liquor Prince Smith on his Baltic estate, and the rapturous applause it received. And on top of that the <i>Kölnische</i> <i>Zeitung</i>'s transports over von der Heydt, and the admiration evinced even by the <i>Presse</i> for the energy and determination shown by the democratic press in Berlin??!!</p>
<p>The girls would have written to you long ago, but little Jenny declared that she detested the idea of what was simply a private letter being subjected to threefold censorship. Hence her silence.</p>
<p>Karl dear, it's frightful that I should have to <b>bother</b> you amidst all your other tribulations; but, with Easter upon us, the fellows are growing rabid. Can't you manage to raise something, if only, for Withers. They are the worst....</p>
<p>The others are better — they can still be staved off for a while. I went to see Miss Morton yesterday and explained matters to her.</p>
<p>Your<br>Jenny

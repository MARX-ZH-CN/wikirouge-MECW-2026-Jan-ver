MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 2 March 1869</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>You must either send me the booklet from Lugau—or, better still, send me <i>in German</i> the paragraphs of the rules that you quote.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>I shall translate the stuff myself, since I do not regard Wilhelm<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>as competent and also because I do not wish to hand over the affair to him alone.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>A p r o p o s. A PAMPHLET, WRITTEN BY A PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT, ADDRESSED TO M R G l a d s t o n e<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>states that at least 1/10 of the LIFE ASSURANCE CO'S (the whole BUSINESS IN LIFE ASSURANCE has a nominal capital of £100 million) is <i>bankrupt</i> and is NOT WORTH THE PAPER UPON WHICH THEY PRINT THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS.</p>
<p>What will the bourgeois gentlemen say to this, those gentlemen who were so very very delighted about the <i>PROSPECTIVE</i> BANKRUPTCY (in 20 years or so) of the TRADES UNIONS?</p>
<p>They will keep their mouths shut.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Engels wrote the 'Report on the Miners' Guilds in the Coalfields of Saxony' (see present edition, Vol. 21) at Marx's request on the basis of material sent in by the Saxon miners from Lugau, Nieder-Würschnitz and Oelsnitz, who informed the General Council and Marx personally of their wish to join the International (see Note 241). The report, which Engels had written in English, was read at the General Council meeting of 23 February 1869. An abridged version appeared in <i>The Bee-Hive,</i> No. 385, 27 February 1869. Other English newspapers, including <i>The Times, The Daily News</i> and <i>The Morning Advertiser,</i> refused to carry the report. In early March 1869 Marx himself translated it into German, and it was published in <i>Der Social-Demokrat,</i> No. 33, 17 March, <i>Demokratisches Wochenblatt,</i> No. 12 (supplement), 20 March, and <i>Die Zukunft,</i> nos. 67 and 68, 20 and 21 March 1869.</span>

<p>ENGELS TO ADELHEID DWORAK</p>
<p>IN VIENNA</p>
<p>London, 21 December 1893<br>
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W. <i>[Copy]</i></p>
<p>Dear Adelheid,</p>
<p>I still owe you my thanks for your kind congratulations on my 73<sup>rd</sup> birthday 314 and am sending them today in order to use the occasion for wishing you a very nice holiday. I hope that the vacation from oratory arranged for you during our stay in Vienna 257 has done you good and you are again as fit and full of fighting spirit as we all wish you to be. Unless I misread all the signs, you are in for eventful times and lengthy battles in Austria. May the workers there prove that, along with the necessary audacity, they possess the patience, calm, judgement and discipline which alone can lead to victory.</p>
<p>Cordial greetings to you and all comrades, Your old</p>
<p>F. Engels</p>
<p>Take it from me, I will still claim that '<i>kiss</i> some day.
</p>

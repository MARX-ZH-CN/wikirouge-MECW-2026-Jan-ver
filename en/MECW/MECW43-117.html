ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester, 25 November 1868]</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Enclosed returned the letters<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Jones is COOL INDEED, and in every sense he has counted his chickens before they are hatched. He will scarcely find another place to elect him. LIBERALS OF HIS CALIBRE there are enough, and more than enough, ever since he identified himself with this variety. Even the great Dr Borchardt asked him (if one can believe Dr Borchardt) how he could identify himself in such a way with Bright and Gladstone, since he would certainly have to attack them in 5 years time.</p>
<p>Nothing else new here. I have finally prevailed on Lizzie to let Gumpert treat her; so far she resisted, and said there was nothing wrong with her. He will probably have been there today. Incidentally, she was better today.</p>
<p>Your
F. E.

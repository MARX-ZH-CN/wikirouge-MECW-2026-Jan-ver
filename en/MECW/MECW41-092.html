MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 29 July [1860]</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Enclosed herewith the final nonsuit from the High Court.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> It would be useless to go on to the Supreme Tribunal. It would simply add to the costs. It's imperative that I now send Weber his 32 talers 3 silver groschen and 6 pfennigs so that the chap can let me have the documents (including <i>his indictment)</i> by return. I need them for the pamphlet,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> which will be ready for my wife to copy (and she'll do it quickly) within the next 8-10 days.</p>
<p>What is to be done next (I mean in the newspapers)? A lawsuit like this (note, e.g., the deplorable tone, reminiscent of newspaper polemics, of the High Court's findings) is something I have not come across before. These Prussian curs need a thorough hiding. It's a good thing, by the by, that they've supplied me with 'material'.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the craven rabble in the High Court did see fit to disallow Mr Vogt's insinuations about 'extortion', etc.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>Eccarius has been lodging a few doors away from us for nearly three weeks now and is feeling better.

ENGELS TO HERMANN SCHLÜTER</p>
<p>IN HOTTINGEN-ZURICH</p>
<p>London, 19 February 1888</p>
<p>Dear Mr Schlüter,</p>
<p>I cannot manage it. So you had better print something else in the meantime and if possible let me know a fortnight or 3 weeks in advance</p>
<p>when you will be ready and can do with the ms.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Suddenly I seem to be snowed under. For instance, it will take me almost the whole of this week to deal with the correspondence which, as a matter of principle, I had laid on one side.</p>
<p>As soon as possible I shall send you the English <i>Manifesto</i> for the archives.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Kindest regards to you all,</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F. Engels

Their purpose was to preserve the manuscripts of prominent figures in the German labour movement (including the works of Marx and Engels), and documents pertaining to the history of Germany and the international working-class movement, and the labour press. The initial site of the archives was Zurich. The first materials were collected by Eduard Bernstein. From April 1883 the archives were in the custody of Hermann Schluter. In June 1888, following the expulsion of some members of the Sozialdemokrat editorial staff and co-workers from Switzerland (see note 81), the archives were moved to London and, after the abrogation of the Anti-Socialist law (see note 52), to Berlin.</span>

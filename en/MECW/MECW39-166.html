<br><i>To Engels in Manchester</i>
<br><b>[London,] 2 June 1853, 28 Dean Street, Soho</b>
<br>Dear Frederic,
<br>The first half of the £20 note has turned up. I am writing this before going to the Museum, i.e. at a very early hour.
<br>I would have sent you long ago the enclosed great Willich's statement to the <em>Neu-England-Zeitung</em> had I not assumed that you'd had the thing from Weydemeyer. In <em>conception</em> this second statement is pure, genuine Willich. Others write 'essays', he writes 'facts', and only if one has been on a 'personal footing' with him does the calumny lose its sting. It is the manoeuvre of your petty partisan. He does not answer for his own Hirsch. Rather, he explains to the public Marx's 'motives' for not refuting his Hirsch. And now he has discovered a terrain where he can operate with a measure of virtuosity. And it is with 'reluctance' that the noble man reveals the facts to the 'public'. Needless to say, he has preferred to whisper them to the philistines in the privacy of the beer-parlour and, for the past three years, to peddle them 'contraband-wise' throughout two hemispheres, <em>juvante Kinkelio</em>. Then his manoeuvring to keep the public on tenterhooks. They forget the facts among which he twists and turns and eagerly await the facts which are to demolish the 'critical authors'. And the noble man is 'distinguished' withal, as befits a 'public figure'. When he does reply, it will not be to Marx's uncouth 'agents' but to the 'ingenious' quill-pushers themselves. Finally, he gives the public to understand that what makes his opponents so cocksure is their belief in his 'decision' to retire and, with a roll of drums, this important personage proceeds to announce that he has 'changed' his mind.
<br><em>Tout ça n'est pas trop mal pour un vieux sous-lieutenant</em>. But as for the style of statement No. 2 — bad as it is, it is nevertheless apocryphal. Other hands have been at work on it, probably those of Madame Anneke. At all events, the necessary supplement to Tellering's pamphlet will now be published by Mr Willich and, the dirty business having been once placed before the public, <em>il faut aller jusqu'au bout</em>. If Weydemeyer, Cluss and Co. operate with skill, they should now be able to put a spoke in Willich's wheel and ruin the impact and novelty of the surprises he is holding in store for the public. <em>Nous verrons</em>.
<br>The praise you accord to my 'budding' English, I find most encouraging. What I chiefly lack is first, assurance as to grammar and secondly, skill in using various secondary idioms which alone enable one to write with any pungency. Mr <em>Tribune</em> has given special prominence to a note about my 2nd article on Gladstone's Budget, drawing the attention of readers to my 'masterly exposition' and going on to say that nowhere have they seen 'a more able criticism', and do 'not expect to see one'. Well, that is all right. But in the following article it proceeds to make an ass of me by printing under my name a heading of mine which is quite trifling and intentionally so, whereas it appropriates your 'Swiss' thing. I shall write and tell Dana that, 'flattering' though it may be if they occasionally use my things for a leader, they would oblige me by not putting my name to trifles. I have now sent the jackasses, amongst other things, 2 articles on 'China' with reference to England. If you have the time and happen to feel like writing about something — Switzerland, the East, France, England or cotton, or <em>Denmark</em>, say — you should do so on occasion, for I am now slogging away with an eye to the fellow's money-bags in order to make good the 3 weeks I have lost. If you send me something from time to time — <em>de omnibus rebus</em> — I shall always be able to place it, for as you know, I am the fellows' 'maid of all work', and it's always easy to relate one thing to another and to every day. Panta en panta.
<br>As regards the Hebrews and Arabs, I found your letter most interesting. It can, by the by, be shown that 1. in the case of all eastern tribes there has been, since the dawn of history, a general relationship between the settlement of one section and the continued nomadism of the others. 2. In Mohammed's time the trade route from Europe to Asia underwent considerable modification, and the cities of Arabia, which had had a large share of the trade with India, etc., suffered a commercial decline — a fact which at all events contributed to the process. 3. So far as religion is concerned, the question may be reduced to a general and hence easily answerable one: Why does the history of the East appear as a history of religions?
<br>On the subject of the growth of eastern cities one could hardly find anything more brilliant, comprehensive or striking than <em>Voyages contenant la description des états du Grand Mogol, etc.</em> by old Franoçois Bernier (for 9 years Aurangzeb's physician). He provides in addition a very nice account of military organisation and the manner in which these large armies fed themselves, etc. Concerning both these he remarks <em>inter alia</em>:

<blockquote>
<br>'The main body consists of cavalry, the infantry not being so numerous as is commonly supposed unless all those serving-people and bazaar or market folk who follow the army are taken for true warriors; for, if such were the case, there would, I think, be good reason to put at 2 to 300,000 men the strength of that army alone that is with the king, and sometimes even more, as, for example, when it is known that he will be long absent from the capital city; which would not, indeed, seem so very surprising to anyone familiar with all the strange impedimenta of tents, kitchen, clothing, furniture, and even women quite often, and, consequently, elephants, camels, oxen, horses, porters, foragers, sutlers, merchants of all kinds and servants who follow in the wake of these armies, nor to anyone familiar with the conditions and government peculiar to the country, namely that the <em>king is the sole and unique proprietor of all the lands</em> in the kingdom, whence it necessarily follows that every capital city, such as Delhi or Agra, fixes almost wholly on the militia and is therefore obliged to follow the king whenever he goes campaigning for a time, these cities neither being, nor indeed able to be, in any respect a Paris, but <em>being really nothing but an army encampment</em> rather better and more commodiously situated than if it were in the open country.' [in French, with Marx's italics]

</blockquote>
<br>In reference to the Grand Mogul's march on Kashmir, with an army 400,000 strong, he writes:

<blockquote>
<br>How and upon what so great an army can subsist in the field, or so large a concourse of men and animals, is difficult to conceive. To that end one can only surmise, and such is indeed the case, that the Indians are very sober and very simple in what they eat and that, of this great number of horsemen, not one tenth, nay, not even one twentieth, eats meat during the march; provided they have their khichri, or mess of rice and other vegetables, whereon they pour brown butter when cooked, they are content. It should also be known that camels are extremely resistant to work, hunger and thirst, live on very little and eat anything and that, as soon as the army reaches camp, the camel-drivers lead them out to graze in the countryside, where they eat everything that comes their way; further, that the same merchants that keep the bazaars in Delhi are obliged to keep them in the field also, likewise the lesser merchants, etc. ... finally, concerning forage, all these poor people go roving in every direction to the villages to buy the same and to earn something there, and that their chief and habitual recourse is to scratch up whole stretches of country with a kind of trowel, pounding and washing the little herbs thus scratched up, and taking them to the army for sale...

</blockquote>
<br>Bernier rightly sees all the manifestations of the East — he mentions Turkey, Persia and Hindustan — as having a common basis, namely the <em>absence of private landed property</em>. This is the real <em>clef</em>, even to the eastern heaven.
<br>It would seem to be no go with Borchardt; nevertheless I think the fellow might be prepared to try and obtain recommendations for Lupus from Steinthal, etc., to London merchants. So much, at least, you could compel him to do, and it would mean a great deal to Lupus.
<br>What do you think about the failure of the hudibrastic Rodolpho Gladstone's 'Financial Scheme for reducing the national Debt'?
<br>The day before yesterday the <em>Journal des Débats</em> revealed the true secret of Russia's impudence. The Continent, it says, must either expose its independence to danger from Russia, or it must expose itself to war, and that is '<em>la revolution sociale</em>'. What the wretched <em>Débats</em> forgets, however, is that Russia is no less afraid of revolution than Mr Bertin, and that the whole question now is who can most convincingly simulate 'non-fear'. But England and France — the official ones — are so abject that Nicholas, if he sticks to his guns, will be able to do what he likes.
<br><em>Vale faveque.</em>
<br>C. M.
<br>Have written to Lassalle, who will probably be ready to take receipt of a few 100 copies of the pamphlet and distribute them in Germany. The question now is how are we to get them across? When I was in Manchester Charles suggested it might be done by including them in a consignment of merchandise. You might ask him about this again.
<br>P.S. There's been a delay over the posting of this letter and so I can include an acknowledgment of the parcel of books and the other half of the note.

MARX TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE</p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>[London,] 29 May 1872</p>
<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p><i>En toute hâte</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> In yesterday's meeting of the General Council, at which almost all the members of the Commune were present, Hales read out Praitsching's letter.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>I followed this up by relating the <i>aventures</i> of the <i>Contre</i> COUNCIL, basing myself partly on your letter,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> and partly on the issue of the <i>World</i> you sent me, and I emphasised how these facts confirmed the necessity of the RESOLUTIONS adopted at my sugges- tion.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> Eccarius WAS THUNDERSTRUCK.</p>
<p>This was followed by a useful INCIDENT which I instantly exploited.</p>
<p>Eccarius had received a letter from St Louis in which a German section which had formed there inquired which of the two FEDERAL COUNCILS to go by. I said, naturally, they should acknowledge the COUNCIL that agreed with us, the old one. Hales and Eccarius (although mortal enemies) spoke against this. I replied and the motion was carried in the very well-attended meeting with only 3 votes against (Hales, Eccarius and Delahaye—who counts for nothing with the other members of the Commune).</p>
<p>Le Moussu will inform you of this officially tomorrow, and you would then do well to make it known (naturally as something self-evident and not on instructions from London) that, on the occasion of this application from that German section, the General Council resolved that your COUNCIL is the only one with which it is <i>en règle</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> and hence which is recognised.</p>
<p><i>Tout à vous,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Karl Marx

The report dealt with the unsuccessful attempts to reach an agreement with the separatist council on the basis of the General Council resolutions of 5 and 12 March 1872 (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 124-26).</span>

ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 2 April 1869</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>I cannot write much to you today, since for some time I have had a chronically inflamed eye (mild), and can only do the most essential work.</p>
<p><i>L'homme propose et la femme dispose.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Yesterday evening I laid out for you a pile of copies of <i>Zukunft,</i> and also B. Becker on Lassalle,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> but this morning the room was being swept out, so I forgot them. <i>Die Zukunft,</i> incidentally, has carried the Lugau story as a feature article.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Wilhelm's stupidities exceed everything. Bebel's cry of alarm was really touching.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> As you will see from <i>Zukunft,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> his friends in Hanover, the particularists, voted in the Lüneburg election <i>against</i> Yorck (Lassallean) and <i>for</i> the National-Liberal.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> The rabble are all united against the workers but this does not disturb Liebknecht. I look forward to the dread debate with great eagerness.</p>
<p>About <i>Vogt</i>:<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> if I were you I would write directly to the Berlin Hirsch. Then you will finally reach the proper quarter.</p>
<p>Lizzie is better, but does not go out yet and is on a strengthening diet. How is MRS Lafargue?</p>
<p>Best wishes.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

While working on the review, Engels wrote out excerpts from<i> Capital,</i> which later made up a synopsis (see Note 26). The review was written around 20 May-1 June 1868, but rejected by the editorial board (see present edition, Vol. 20).</span>

<li id="cite_note-5"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-5">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">A reference to August Bebel's letter TO MARX of 27 March 1869 written in connection with the dispute between Bebel and Liebknecht, on the one hand, and Schweitzer, on the other, at the congress of the General Association of German Workers held in Barmen-Elberfeld on 28-31 March 1869. Pressured by the workers, Schweitzer was obliged to meet half-way the demand of the Association's Leipzig members for an open discussion with Liebknecht, and for his and Bebel's presence at the Barmen-Elberfeld congress (see Note 318). Afraid of losing his prestige in the Association, Schweitzer intended to sub mit for discussion a proposal on establishing closer contacts with the Interna tional. Bebel, who had with Liebknecht arrived at Barmen-Elberfeld on the eve of the congress, warned Marx about Schweitzer's demagogic manoeuvres in the above-mentioned letter of 27 March 1869: 'We have heard so much about Schweitzer's mean tricks here that our hair is standing on end. It is now abundantly clear that Schweitzer has proposed the International's programme solely for the purpose of dealing us a strong blow and splitting up or winning over to his side the majority of the opposition. I request you therefore on my behalf, and also on that of Liebknecht and our other friends, to ignore for the time being the request to approve the corresponding decision of the congress or at least to give Schweitzer a very cautious reply.'</span>

MARX TO FERDINAND LASSALLE</p>
<p>IN BERLIN</p>
<p>[London,] 15 February 1861</p>
<p>Dear Lassalle,</p>
<p>I did not, as I had intended, send off a second letter to you on the heels of my first,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>because, in the meantime, a <i>crisis</i> had supervened, i.e., a financial crisis. Dana wrote from New York, saying that it (the <i>Tribune)</i> had dismissed <i>all</i> its European correspondents, retaining nobody save myself, but that 1. the <i>Cyclopaedia</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>was to be temporarily suspended; 2. my contributions were to be suspended for 6 weeks; 3. finally, that in future I was to write one article less per week.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances and in view of the expenditure arising out of my wife's illness, I have got to go to Holland and see my uncle Philips, if I am to put my financial affairs in some sort of order. Since I require money for the trip I have drawn a bill on you for £20 (ABOUT 34 talers) payable at 6 weeks' sight. I shall send you the required sum from Holland <i>before the expiry date</i> or else <i>bring it to Berlin in person,</i> for I may possibly come as far. I shall come, by the by, simply as a <i>traveller</i> if, that is, I cross the Dutch border and enter Germany. (If I were Karl Heinzen — Heineke the lusty knave<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>— I should say OVERSTRIDE.)</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. Marx

In his work 'Moralising Criticism and Critical Morality' (present edition, Vol. 6) Marx compared Heinzen's journalistic writings with samples of grobian literature.</span>

MARX TO LOUIS WATTEAU<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>IN BRUSSELS
<br>[London,] 10 November 1861
<br>Dear Citizen,
<br>My reply to your last letters has been delayed for so long because I was waiting from day to day for news from a lady you know.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> At last I have learned that she left for Italy some months ago but will shortly be returning to Berlin.
<br>If the first letter for L.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> has not arrived, I imagine that the fault must lie in the address; it was marked <i>via Gibraltar</i> instead of <i>via Southampton.</i> After I had been advised of this mistake, I corrected the address on the second letter. This I not only franked but also registered. I enclose the receipt from the English post office.
<br>The 50 francs I am sending you comes from a German working men's club.<sup>c</sup> In my next letter I shall send you a further contribution. Please be so kind as to acknowledge receipt and send copies of your pamphlet<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> in return.
<br>It would be useful if you were to write me a letter I could send to Berlin and which would establish the monetary resources needed for a &lt;rescue attempt&gt;.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> I should return it to the appropriate quarter.
<br>Rest assured that there is no one more interested than myself in the lot of a man<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> whom I have always regarded as the brains and inspiration of the proletarian party in France.
<br><i>Salut.</i>
<br>K. M.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">This is the only letter of the Marx-Watteau correspondence on the Blanqui case to have been found (see Note 322). The French original is in the collection of the Blanqui papers at the Bibliothèque nationale in Paris.<br>The last paragraph of the letter was first published in Roger Garaudy's book, <i>Les sources françaises du socialisme scientifique,</i> Paris, 1948, p. 217. The letter was published in full, except for three obliterated words, in Vol. 30 of the Second Russian Edition of the <i>Works</i> of Marx and Engels in 1963 and in the language of the original in <i>La Pensée,</i> No. 125, Paris, 1966. The three obliterated words, since deciphered with the aid of modern technical facilities, read <i>tentative de sauvetage</i> and are evidence of Marx's involvement in the plans for rescuing Blanqui. The full text of the letter, including these three words, was published by Maurice Paz in <i>La Nouvelle revue socialiste. Politique. Culture,</i> No. 20, 1976.<br>In a letter to Marx dated 22 January 1862 Blanqui thanked him for what he was doing in his behalf.</br></br></span>

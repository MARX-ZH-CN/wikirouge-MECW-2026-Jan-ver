ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 28 January 1858</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Herewith 3 B articles.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I had meant, if possible, to do Windham<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> as well today, but in the first place the PARTICULARS are still very confused and it is absolutely essential to wait for the official report on the affair, for hitherto everything has been glossed over; and, secondly, I had no time this afternoon, was barely able to look over the 3 articles. Also, I have too bad a cold to risk going into town at midnight to post the letter. Tell Dana that the material is still incomplete.</p>
<p>Have you sent Dana my C list? If not, do so <i>now</i> so that he can reply in good time. Once again his C is LUDICROUSLY INCOMPLETE.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I couldn't make 'Borodino' any shorter since all previous accounts of the battle have been quite wrong.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

In view of a new request from Dana  for 'B' articles, which Marx forwarded to Engels on 23 January (see this  volume, p. 251), Engels put off 'C articles and began fulfilling this  request.—254</span>

<p>Abensburg, a small town with 1,200 inhabitants, in the circle of Regen, kingdom of Bavaria. It is believed to have been the Abasinum of the Romans. There is a thermal spring in the neighborhood, with the ruins of a fine castle. On April 20, 1809, Bonaparte fought and defeated the Austrians near Abensberg, who lost twelve guns and 13,000 men. This victory was the precursor of the victories of Landshut and Eckmühl, and opened the road to Vienna.

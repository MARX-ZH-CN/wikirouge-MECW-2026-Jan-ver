<p>Dear Comrade ,</p>
<p>I regret that I shall not be able to participate this time in your March celebration. The recurrence of an otherwise trivial malady which afflicts me from time to time, and which can only be cured by absolute rest, has again confined me to my house for several weeks. However, I hope and wish that my absence will not diminish the success of your celebration, and remain, with best wishes,</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p><i><b>F. Engels</b></i>

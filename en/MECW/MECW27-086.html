<blockquote>
<p>As follows from Engels' <a href="MECW50-221.html">letter to Karl Kautsky of November 22, 1894</a> (see present edition, Vol. 50) this note was deliberately written as an anonymous reply to a publication in the Vorwärts, No. 266 on November 14, 1894 .</p>
<p>On the manuscript of Marx's Theories of Surplus Value (the iourth volume of Capital), see Note 401.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An announcement of this published by the <i>Vorwärts</i> says that it would probably be necessary to forgo the publication of the fourth volume, which was to contain the history of the theory:</p>
<p>"apart from a few notes, no preparatory material for the concluding volume of his work has been found".</p>
<p>We hope that the <i>Vorwärts</i> is somewhat mistaken in this. At any rate F. Engels presents us with a rather less hopeless piece of information in the Preface to the second volume of Capital. According to this, a manuscript dating from the years 1861-63, A <i>Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</i> comprising 1,472 quarto pages, contains (pp. 220-972) a section entitled "Theories of Surplus Value", of which Engels says: "This section contains a <i>detailed critical history</i> of the pith and marrow of Political Economy, the theory of surplus value... After eliminating the numerous passages covered by Books II and III, I intend to publish the critical part of this manuscript as <i>Book IV</i>"<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>

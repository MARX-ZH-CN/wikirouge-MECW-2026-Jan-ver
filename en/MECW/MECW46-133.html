ENGELS TO BERTHOLD SPARR</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London,] 12 April 1882</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I am not acquainted either with you or with the Mr K. Schmidt you refer to. If you mean Mr K. Schneidt, the anarchist, he will be able to get you into the club in Rose Street<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>and obtain assistance for you. In view of the way in which the people on the <i>Freiheit</i> have laid into the Social-Democratic Party in Germany,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>I hardly feel called upon to give the adherents of that tendency a helping hand. However I do not know which tendency you belong to. The German Club, which sides with the great party in Germany, is, as anyone will tell you, at 49 Tottenham Street<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>and I find it inconceivable that both these clubs should let a fugitive party member starve to death.— In view of the great distress brought about among the members of the great Social-Democratic Party by police persecution in Germany, my resources will scarcely permit me to support, in addition, adherents of other, opposing tendencies. If, however, the Tottenham Street society is prepared to do something for you, I shall be pleased to make a contribution.</p>
<p>Yours very truly
</p>

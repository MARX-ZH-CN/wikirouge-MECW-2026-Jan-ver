ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester, about 21 February 1863]</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>I shall send you the stuff for the manifesto<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>—quite brief—, but it is pretty sure to contain a good deal that partly encroaches on your province—you will have to deal with this.</p>
<p><i>Ad vocem</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>pamphlet: I thought of dividing the thing up as follows: 1. Russia's military position vis-à-vis the West and South <i>before,</i> 2. ditto <i>after,</i> the 3 partitions of Poland, 3. ditto after 1814,<sup>518</sup> 4. the attitude of Russia and Germany after the restoration of Poland. (Something will have to be said here about Prussian Poland, linguistic boundaries, and the statistical proportions of the mixed population.) All in all, at most 3-4 sheets; title: Germany and Poland. Political-Military Considerations on the Occasion of the Polish Uprising of 1863.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>It would then be up to you to go over your notes in the meantime and prepare them to the extent of being able, immediately on receipt of the ms., either to fit them in at the appropriate places or include them as an appendix and refer to them as necessary. If you have any further observations to make about this, write and tell me as soon as possible so that I can bear them in mind.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

Marx's numerous manuscripts, drafts and excerpts on the subject were published by the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the CC CPSU in the <i>Marx-Engels Archives,</i> Vol. XIV, Moscow, 1973 and also in Warsaw in: Marks K., <i>Przyczynki do historii kwestii polskiej (Rekopisy z lat 1863-1864),</i> 1971. No manuscripts by Engels relating to the pamphlet in question have been found.</span>

<p>December 27, 1851</p>
<p>Moorish Prince,</p>
<p>Enclosed is a letter from Ebner.</p>
<p>Today I also received another letter from Weydemeyer. Among other things he writes:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A few days ago a delegate arrived from the London Agitation Union to oppose the Kinkel loans. These people probably imagine that here in America, everybody is split into pro-Kinkel and anti-Kinkel factions, because a handful of fugitives have made much ado about nothing. The Kossuth sensation long ago made Kinkel a forgotten man and the few thousand dollars which he collects are not in fact worth all the fuss.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"I can in any case look after the sale of the <em>Revue</em> for you here. A few more of Freiligrath's new poems could also be accommodated here."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After W[eydemeyer] has given us another push he writes:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But first and foremost a Freiligrath poem: that is the greatest attraction."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take this to heart and concoct a New Year song to the New World. Under the present circumstances I believe it is really easier to write in verse than in prose, be it heavy or light-hearted. Incidentally, if you ever attempt to turn the humour that is peculiar to your African majesty in private life into artistic form, I am certain you would play a role in this genre too, for, as your wife has rightly noted, you are a sly one underneath.

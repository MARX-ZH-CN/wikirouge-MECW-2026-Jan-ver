ENGELS TO JOHANN HEINRICH WILHELM DIETZ</p>
<p>IN STUTTGART</p>
<p>London, 1 April 1890</p>
<p>To Mr J. H. W. Dietz, Stuttgart.</p>
<p>I have just noticed that you have taken the liberty of making various alterations to my article on Russian policy<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>without the consent of myself or of the editors,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>alterations which are wholly uncalled for, whether from the viewpoint of the penal code or of the Anti-Socialist Law.</p>
<p>I have behaved as decently as possible towards you over this matter. I asked Kautsky to get you to score any passages that struck you as objectionable when you read the proofs. I in turn altered many of the scored passages and sent a request that if you felt further alterations to be advisable, you should write to us, stating your reasons. Since no more objections were forthcoming, I could only assume that the article would appear unaltered.</p>
<p>Instead of that you have altered passages which you had not even scored.</p>
<p>As it is not my habit to put up with this sort of thing from publish- ers, / <i>hereby forbid you to print the remainder of the article unless it agrees word for word with the proofs corrected by myself</i> and I reserve the right to take any other steps I think fit.</p>
<p>I need hardly say that in future I shall be careful not to write again for a periodical in which one is exposed to things of this nature.</p>
<p>Yours very faithfully,</p>
<p>F. Engels

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 29 April 1870</p>
<p>Dear FRED,</p>
<p>POOR Schapper died yesterday morning at 9 o'clock. Enclosed, 3 issues of <i>Marseillaise</i> containing J. Williams.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>I must <i>have them back</i> (with the Swiss <i>Egalité</i> and <i>Solidarité)</i> because of notes for the GENERAL COUNCIL,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>for which I have not yet found time. <i>(Don't</i> send back the <i>Spanish</i> <i>papers.)</i> Ditto, latest <i>Vorbote.</i> You will see from this that Becker has broken openly with Bakunin.</p>
<p><i>(Don't</i> send back.) Finally, ONE COPY of the <i>Russian translation</i> of our <i>Communist Manifesto</i> for you. I saw in the <i>Werker,</i> etc., that the <i>Kolokol</i> publishing house, which was willed to Bakunin, also includes 'this stuff, so ordered 6 copies from Geneva.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>It's very interesting for us.</p>
<p><i>Addio</i> OLD BOY. COMPLIMENTS TO MRS Lizzy, Jollymeyer AND Moore.</p>

While working on the review, Engels wrote out excerpts from<i> Capital,</i> which later made up a synopsis (see Note 26). The review was written around 20 May-1 June 1868, but rejected by the editorial board (see present edition, Vol. 20).</span>

The<i> Customs Union Parliament</i>—the guiding body of the Customs Union reorganised after the war of 1866 and the signing, on 8 July 1867, of a peace treaty between Prussia and the South German states, which provided for the establishment of this body. The Parliament comprised members of the North German Confederation's Reichstag and deputies from the South German states: Bavaria, Baden, Württemberg and Hesse. Bebel and Liebknecht were the two workers' deputies in it. It was to deal exclusively with issues of trade and customs policies; Bismarck's intention gradually to widen its jurisdiction by encompassing political questions was met with stubborn opposition from the South German representatives (see Note 62).</span>

ENGELS TO FRANZ MEHRING</p>
<p>IN BERLIN</p>
<p>London, 9 May 1895<br>
41 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Mr Mehring,</p>
<p>Very many thanks for your long and informative letter plus enclosures, which I shall reply to at length as soon as my cranium permits. Unfortunately for the past week a rheumatic condition of the scalp has been encircling and compressing it as though with a band of iron. I hope to have got over it by next week along with the attendant insomnia. Meanwhile I agree to your proposal that the only articles from the <i>Rheinische Zeitung</i> that should be published in their entirety are the two long ones and those on Communism<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> (as also the article from the <i>Anekdota</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> ). It would only be necessary to copy from the remainder such passages as you might be so good as to indicate as being the most pregnant (along with particulars of the context). As regards the Mosel articles, 584 it would be desirable if my introduction included a brief outline both of the course of the debate and of the contents. Would you be kind enough to acquaint Fischer with the foregoing? Once again my best thanks and until my next, which has to do with one minor detail,</p>
<p>I remain<br>
Yours sincerely<br>
F. Engels

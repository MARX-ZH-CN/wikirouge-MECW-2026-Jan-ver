ENGELS TO PHILIPP PAULI</p>
<p>IN RHEINAU</p>
<p>Ramsgate, 11 August 1876<br>
11 Camden Square</p>
<p>Dear Pauli,</p>
<p>On Friday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>I duly proceeded to Cologne as planned and would have gone on overnight to London via Ostend had not the confounded midge bite on my left hand swollen to truly colossal proportions. So I went to an hotel in Cologne and held my hand in iced water for about an hour, which relieved the worst of the inflammation; on Saturday to England via Flushing. At Chatham I found a train going to Ramsgate and came straight here.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>When I arrived in London on Tuesday I found Schorlemmer at the Marxes preparing to leave for Darmstadt on Wednesday, where he will doubtless arrive today.</p>
<p>It's still very fine here, moderately hot summer temperatures and a cool wind off the sea, on top of which the bottled beer is excellent and salt water bathing 'a proper treat',<sup>0</sup> as Nadler's seamstress would say.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>His stuff has made me laugh a lot; the small town patriot of '48 is particularly well portrayed.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The crossing from Flushing was once again as smooth as glass; I'm heartily sick of it by now; a bit of tossing about is all part of</p>
<p><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>the game, otherwise one has no idea of having been at sea. But that's something I can have whenever I want here aboard the pleasure boats which sail every afternoon.</p>
<p>We are staying here until Monday fortnight and in London shall, I trust, retire from the very idle life we've been a-Ieadin' of.</p>
<p>The trip and the sea-bathing have done my wife a great deal of good, so I have reason to hope that I shall also be able to get her through the winter in passable health. Both she and I send our kindest regards to you, your wife and the children, and in the hope that Rheinau's gnat population will shortly diminish I shall close because of incipient table-laying.</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>F. Engels

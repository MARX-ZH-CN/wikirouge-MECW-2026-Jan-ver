ARNOLD RUGE TO STEINTHAL<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>Brighton, 25 January 1869<br>7 Park Crescent</p>
<p>Dear Mr Steinthal,</p>
<p>At the same time as this letter, I am sending you Marx on capital by book-post.</p>
<p>Many thanks! This book has given me constant food for thought, though I had to work on all sorts of other things at the same time.</p>
<p>It is an <i>epoch-making work</i> and throws a shining and often scorching light on the development of the social periods, with the declines, the birth-pains, and the frightful days of agony.</p>
<p>The proofs of <i>surplus value</i> through unpaid labour, of the expropriation of the workers <i>who</i> had worked <i>for themselves,</i> and of the coming <i>expropriation of the expropriators,</i> are classical.</p>
<p>On the latter, p. 745:'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>The capitalist mode of production and appropriation, hence <i>capitalist</i> property, is the first negation of <i>individual private property, as founded on the labour of the proprietor.</i> The <i>negation of this negation</i> therefore again gives the producer individual property, but based on the acquisitions of the capitalist era: i.e., <i>on the co-operation of free labourers and their possession in common of the land and of the means of production produced by labour itself</i></p>
<p>Marx is a man of broad erudition and with a brilliant dialectical talent. His book is above the level of many people and newspaper writers; but it will quite certainly make its way, and exercise a powerful influence, despite its broad scope; yes, precisely because of this.</p>
<p>With regard to religion, the author states very accurately: 608: 'As, in religion, man is governed by the products of his own brain, so in capitalistic production, he is governed by the products of his own hand.'</p>
<p>And to liberate him, it by no means suffices to shine a light in the owl's eye; in fact, whenever he loses his master, like the Frenchman or the Spaniard, then he himself installs one over himself again.</p>
<p>But still all the best for 1869! May it stand the test like its predecessor! My best<br>
greetings<br>
to<br>
Mrs Steinthal<br>
and<br>
Mr Heydemann.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>Dr A. Ruge

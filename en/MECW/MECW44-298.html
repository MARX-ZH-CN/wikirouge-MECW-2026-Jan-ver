MARX TO HUGO HELLER
<br>IN OXFORD
<br>Manchester, 23 May 1873
<br>Dear Friend,
<br>I am staying up here for a day or two, but would rather not put off answering your letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> until my return to London.
<br>I have sent 2/6d in STAMPS for a membership card to a member of the British Federal Council, Serraillier, so that it will, in a few days' time (the Federal Council meets only once a week), be sent to Oxford.
<br>If Thomas, your friend there, would care to write to me direct, I shall be very glad to get in touch with him.
<br>In a week or two the 2nd German edition of <i>Capital,</i> which came out in instalments, will be published in one volume<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and I should be pleased to present it to you as a memento, and likewise such instalments of the Paris translation as have so far appeared.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <br>Madame and MR Longuet have asked me to send you their warm regards.
<br><i>Salut fraternel.</i>
<br>Karl Marx

However, its contents and Marx's correspondence on the subject indicate that it was addressed to the heads of the Lachâtre publishing house in Paris. On 13 February 1872 Marx received a reply from the manager Juste Vernouillet, who informed him about the despatch of copies of the agree ment on the publication of the French translation of Volume I of<i> Capital.</i> The agreement was signed on 15 February by Marx on one side, and Maurice Lachâtre and Juste Vernouillet on the other. It stipulated that the French edi tion was to be published in 44 instalments, and sold five instalments at a time.<br>The French authorised edition of Volume I of<i> Capital</i> was published between 17 September 1872 and November 1875. The translation was done by Joseph Roy, who began in February 1872 and completed work in late 1873. The quality of the translation largely failed to satisfy Marx; besides, he was convinced that the original needed to be revised to adapt it to French readers.</br></span>

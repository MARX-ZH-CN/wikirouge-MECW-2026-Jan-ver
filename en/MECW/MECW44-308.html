MARX TO JUSTE VERNOUILLET
<br>IN PARIS
<br>[London,] 10 July 1873
<br>Dear Citizen,
<br>After a lengthy interval, I have just sent off some of the manuscript (Part VI) and some proofs<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> to Mr Lahure.
<br>As you will know, the most dangerous thing about an illness is a relapse, but I am now in a condition to set to work seriously once more on Mr Roy's manuscript<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> —of which a great deal has now accumulated.
<br>However, the disruption caused by my illness cannot be to blame for the delay in the publication of fascicle IV and for the non-publication of fascicle V.
<br>At a time when I was very unwell I passed sheet 27 for press, but since it cannot be stereotyped without the ensuing instalment VI, I should be glad to have another proof.
<br>Yours ever,
<br>Karl Marx

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The surviving manuscript copy of the letter does not bear the name of the addressee. However, its contents and Marx's correspondence on the subject indicate that it was addressed to the heads of the Lachâtre publishing house in Paris. On 13 February 1872 Marx received a reply from the manager Juste Vernouillet, who informed him about the despatch of copies of the agreement on the publication of the French translation of Volume I of <i>Capital.</i> The agreement was signed on 15 February by Marx on one side, and Maurice Lachâtre and Juste Vernouillet on the other. It stipulated that the French edition was to be published in 44 instalments, and sold five instalments at a time. The French authorised edition of Volume I of <i>Capital</i> was published between 17 September 1872 and November 1875. The translation was done by Joseph Roy, who began in February 1872 and completed work in late 1873. The quality of the translation largely failed to satisfy Marx; besides, he was convinced that the original needed to be revised to adapt it to French readers.</span>

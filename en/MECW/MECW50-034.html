ENGELS TO MRS STEPNIAK (KRAVCHINSKY)</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>London, 6 December 1892
122 Regent's Park Road, N.W.</p>
<p>Dear Mrs Stepniak,</p>
<p>Mrs Kautsky showed me your note in which you are kind enough to ask me to spend next Saturday evening with you. I should do so with the greatest pleasure, but unfortunately my locomotive capabilities are still too limited to enable me to undertake such distant expeditions.</p>
<p>I am at present practically confined to the neighbourhood of Primrose Hill, and Mrs Kautsky will be able to tell you that I have been obliged to decline invitations besides yours.</p>
<p>Kind regards to Stepniak from</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>F. Engels

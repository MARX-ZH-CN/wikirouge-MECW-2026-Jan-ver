ENGELS TO HERMANN SCHLÜTER
<br>IN HOTTINGEN-ZURICH
<br>London, 7 December 1885
<br>Dear Mr Schlüter,
<br>My best thanks for the 2 copies of <i>Diihring.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> If I can have 20 copies all told, that will do for the time being. Please also send me 4 copies of the <i>Peasant War,</i> 3rd edition. I haven't a single copy left and so cannot get to work on the new edition.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>I have no connections whatever with Eccarius and neither can nor wish to renew them. I shall see if the address is obtainable through Lessner. But I would at most advise you simply to reprint without alterations, etc.— for, having gone completely to the dogs, Eccarius is in fact unlikely to make any; moreover, in view of his bad conscience, any such addenda would most likely be used by him to introduce extenuating circumstances for the many ill-deeds he has perpetrated since 1873, and thus materially impair the book which was written with much prompting by and help from Marx (towards the end, entire pages were literally written by Marx), if not render it completely useless for our propaganda. I would even advise you to insist on printing it as it stands.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <br>You will have had the bill for the photographs.<sup>a</sup>
<br>In my <i>Dühring</i> I continue to suffer at the printer's hands even in the list of misprints where I find hopeless 'error' [<i>Verirrung</i>] for 'confusion' [<i>Verwirrung</i>].
<br>Kind regards.
<br>Yours,
<br>F.E.

He intended to reissue the latter's book <i>Eines Arbeiters Widerlegung der national-ökonomischen Lehren John Stuart Mill's</i> in the Social-Democratic publishing house in Zurich; Schlüter believed that Eccarius would revise his book. It appeared in 1888, without any changes on Engels' advice.</span>

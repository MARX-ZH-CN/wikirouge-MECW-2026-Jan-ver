<p>Dear Mr Engels,</p>
<p>Moor has just gone to the Museum and has asked me to thank you for the £5 note you sent so promptly. And now, on top of all our other misfortunes, comes the <b>County Court</b>. The affair's all the more vexing because I arrived just 5 minutes too late, otherwise the judge would certainly have granted me the right to make monthly payments as on the first occasion. You cannot conceive, dear Mr Engels, how painful it is for Karl and me to be such a constant burden on you and, with every letter, to despatch a fresh jeremiad appealing to your friendship and kindness.</p>
<p>Karl has had 6 copies of <i>Po and Rhine</i> for some time now. He forgot to tell you. Of those 6 copies he has given away 3 to acquaintances (Imandt, Juta and Cavanagh). I shall be sending you the rest next week.</p>
<p>The girls — just now they are practising a duet together and singing very nicely indeed — send you their love, to which I too add my warm regards.</p>
<p>Your<br>Jenny Marx

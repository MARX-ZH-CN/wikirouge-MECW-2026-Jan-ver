ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, [8 September 1859] 7 Southgate</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Unfortunately the article can't be sent today. It's now 7 o'clock and I still have at least half an hour's work at the office; it takes me V2 hour to get home and, what is more, I haven't yet set eyes on <i>The Times,</i> nor should I be able to borrow it for this evening. I'd have to finish the whole thing by 11.30 at the latest if I were to get it off—it's <i>clairement impossible,</i> particularly in the case of names which have been wrongly telegraphed and can only be deciphered after one has spent ages poring over the map. However, I'll go over the material for Tuesday and, should the Calcutta MAIL be in by Monday, rectify it accordingly.

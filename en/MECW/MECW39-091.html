MARX TO ADOLF CLUSS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN WASHINGTON</p>
<p>[London, after 5 September 1852]</p>
<p>... Enclosed copy of a manuscript from Paris by Hafner<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>(sometime editor of the <i>Constitution</i>, the only tolerable newspaper in Vienna). This man once allowed himself to be misused to bluster against me in the <i>Hamburger Nachrichten</i> in the interests of Kinkel. The manuscript was not addressed to me but to an acquaintance of mine in Paris,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>through whose 'indiscretion' it came into my hands, probably not wholly without the author's prior knowledge. Hence, you can make use of the document if opportunity arises, but only in such a way as to omit everything that might betray its <i>origin</i>, or rather directly indicate it. Though he may have a hump both fore and aft, little Hafner writes and thinks better and has a great deal more to him than many a straight-limbed revolutionary philistine...

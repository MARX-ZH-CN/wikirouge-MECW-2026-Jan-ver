ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester,] 18 October 1852</p>
<p>Dear Marx,</p>
<p>Herewith the remainder of the recent<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> article.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Yesterday I also received the next one.249 You can at once dispatch VIA LIVERPOOL PER UNITED STATES MAIL STEAMER the piece I am posting you today; the <i>Pacific</i> sails on Wednesday morning. You will be getting some more on Friday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>You really must stop making your articles so long. Dana cannot possibly <i>want</i> more than 1-1½ columns, it would be too much for one number. I shall again have to split this new article, but it's difficult to do and I don't yet know where. Five-7 pages in your wife's handwriting is <i>quite</i> <i>enough</i> and if you give more in one article, Dana won't even thank you for it.</p>
<p>Bürgers and Röser, and perhaps Otto and Nothjung likewise, seem to me pretty well done for. There doesn't appear to be anything at all against Daniels, Becker<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> or Jacobi, and I hope that these at least will get off. Becker has extricated himself with great effrontery. The more these are exonerated the greater, I think, will be the zeal with which the judges and jury will set about the compromised men; the injured bourgeoisie and the injured State want their victims.</p>
<p>The edges of the seals on all the letters I am getting from you show signs of having been gone over with a hot iron but, so far as I can judge, <i>pour le roi de Prusse</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> The gum on the envelope prevents them from getting inside.</p>
<p>Weerth is here, has brought me the parcel, and sends his regards to you all. Szemere's manuscript on Kossuth is far better than the one on Görgey—he's a match for Kossuth. I have not yet been able to look at Pieper's translation,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> being very busy at the office and dog-tired most evenings. Warmest regards to your wife.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

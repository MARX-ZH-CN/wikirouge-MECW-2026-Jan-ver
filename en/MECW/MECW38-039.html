<p><i>To Roland Daniels in Cologne</i>

<h4 class="mw-headline" id="Brussels.2C_7_March_1847">Brussels, 7 March 1847</h4><a id="Brussels,_7_March_1847"></a>
<p>Dear Daniels,</p>
<p><em>You or one of the others in Cologne</em> may get a letter from Hess about communist affairs. I would urgently ask that <em>none</em> of <em>you</em> should answer until I have provided you with documents and letters through W [probably Georg Weerth or Joseph Weydemeyer]. At all events, I must again <em>urgently</em> request you to <em>come here.</em> I have some important things to tell you which cannot be communicated by post. If <em>you</em> can't come, then H. Bürgers must spend a few days here. You or your representative will stay with me .... [remainder of the letter is missing, save for the next sentences, which are written in the margin. After the words 'with me' Marx added 'see above']</p>
<p>So either you or H. Bürgers come to <em>Malines</em> as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Forward the enclosed letter to <em>Zulauff</em>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Grünstrasse, Elberfeld.</p>
<p>Do not come to <em>Brussels</em> but to <em>Malines</em> and write the day before to say when you or Bürgers are coming.</p>
<p>You can neglect your bourgeois affairs for a day or two.</p>
<p>Your<br>Marx

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Marx's letter to Zulauff has not been found. Like the letter published here, it apparently concerned the tasks facing the Brussels Communist Correspondence Committee and the communist groups close to it when Marx and Engels joined the League of the Just as a result of their negotiations at the end of January and the beginning of February 1847 with Joseph Moll, a representative of the London leaders of the League who was sent to Brussels and Paris specially for this purpose. — The negotiations showed that the League leaders were prepared to recognise the principles of scientific communism as a basis when drawing up its programme and carrying out its reorganisation. Marx and Engels, therefore, called on their followers grouped around the Brussels Communist Correspondence Committee not only to join the League of the Just but also to take an active part in its reorganisation.</span>

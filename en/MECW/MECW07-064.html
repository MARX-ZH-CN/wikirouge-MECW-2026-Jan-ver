<p><em>Cologne,</em> July 7. We have a <em>new ministerial crisis</em>. The <em>Camphausen</em> Ministry <em>fell</em>, the <em>Hansemann</em> Ministry <em>faltered</em>. The <em>Government of Action</em> had a life-span of <em>a week</em> in spite of all the little household remedies, cosmetics, press trials, arrests, in spite of the arrogant impudence with which the bureaucracy once again reared its document-dusty head, hatching petty, brutal plots of vengeance for its dethronement. The " <em>Government of Action</em>", composed entirely of mediocrities, was at the start of the Agreement Assembly's most recent session still so deluded as to believe in its own imperturbability.</p>
<p>By the end of the session it was completely routed. This momentous session convinced Prime Minister von <em>Auerswald</em> that he should tender his resignation; nor did Minister von Schreckenstein want any longer to remain as Hansemann's train-bearer and thus the entire Ministry yesterday betook themselves to the King at Sanssouci. What was decided there we shall learn tomorrow.</p>
<p>Our Berlin # correspondent writes in a postscript:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Just now the rumour is spreading that <em>Vincke</em>, <em>Pinder</em> and <em>Mevissen</em> have been urgently sent for to help in the formation of a new Ministry."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this rumour is confirmed we shall <em>finally</em> have come from the Government of mediation through the Government of Action to the Government of the counter-revolution. <em>At last!</em> The very brief life-span of this ministerial counter-revolution would suffice to show to the people in full life-size these dwarfs who raise their diminutive heads at the slightest stirring of reaction.

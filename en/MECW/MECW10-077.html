<p>Note from MECW :
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The annual meeting and the New Year's party arranged by the Fraternal Democrats society were attended by delegations from the German Workers' Educational Society in London (Marx and Engels were no longer among its members), the Hungarian, Polish and other refugee organisations. Marx was present at the meeting together with his wife. Engels, who had come from Manchester for a few days, addressed the meeting in English.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
M. Engels (who, with Carl Schapper, attended as a deputation from the German Society) also responded to this sentiment, thanked them in the name of his brethren for their sympathy, and expressed his best wishes for the prosperity of the English people. He then entered into a long and elaborate statement of the causes of the failures abroad, and the consequent reaction, showing that it equally arose from the ignorance of the people and the treachery of their leaders.

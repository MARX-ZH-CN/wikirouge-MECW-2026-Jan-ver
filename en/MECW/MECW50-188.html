<br>TO OTTO WACHS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> IN BERLIN
<br><i>[Draft]</i>
<br>[London, end of June-beginning of July 1894]
<br>To Major Wachs
<br>Unfortunately, as things are in the Party today, I was obliged to maintain a certain reserve in view of the fact that he<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> contributes to <i>Das Volk.</i> Not because of the paper's standpoint which would have counted for little in a purely personal relationship, but until very recently its editor-in-chief, Mr Oberwinder, played a role in, and on the periphery of, the Social Democratic Party such as to make it absolutely imperative that we also observe a certain reticence vis-à-vis his colleagues.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Needless to say, it would never occur to me to ask of these, Mr Oberwinder's colleagues—as to whose good faith I am not in doubt—that they should believe what we know about him. As you are aware, every social group has its own <i>point d'honneur</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> and that is what is at stake in this instance amongst us Social Democrats.

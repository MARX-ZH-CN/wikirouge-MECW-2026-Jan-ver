MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 22 December 1856</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>You would oblige me greatly if you could send me the money before the week is out. I have just been to see Freiligrath and asked him whether he could advance me anything against my bill</p>
<p>on America, which is drawable only in 2 or 3 weeks' time, <i>mais impossible.</i> I was expecting the money from <i>Putnam's</i> today; hasn't arrived. The TRANSACTIONS with Urquhart's wretched rabble—on whom I have claims—are still in suspense.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>If I'm late with the first payment to my LANDLORD, I shall be <i>entièrement discrédité.</i></p>
<p>In great haste. <i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p><i>P.S.</i> Can you send me any <i>bon mots</i> on the military aspects of the Prussia-Neuchâtel conflict?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>They would be very timely. I have dealt with the diplomatic part myself.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Red Wolff<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>is in Blackburn, Lancashire,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>with his family. Schoolmaster at a salary of £60.

Many of the  insurgents were arrested by the Swiss authorities. The King of Prussia insisted  on their release. In reply, Switzerland demanded that he should relinquish his  tide to Neuchâtel. Under the pressure of France, on whose initiative a  European conference on the issue was held in March 1857, Prussia was forced  to renounce her claims.  In the eighteenth century the principality of Neuchâtel and Valangin (in  German: Neuenburg and Vallendis) was under Prussian rule. It was ceded to  France in 1806, during the Napoleonic wars. In 1815, by a decision of the  Vienna Congress, it was incorporated into the Swiss Confederation as its 21st  canton, while remaining a vassal of Prussia. On 29 February 1848 a bourgeois  revolution in Neuchâtel put an end to Prussian rule and a republic was  proclaimed. Prussia, however, laid constant claims to Neuchâtel up to 1857,  thus causing an acute conflict with the Swiss Republic.—86, 88, 89</span>

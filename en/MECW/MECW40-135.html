MARX TO ENGELS
<br>IN MANCHESTER
<br>[London,] 29 January 1858
<br>DEAR Frederick,
<br>The 3 B articles received.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> It's excellent that you should have made 'Borodino' longer. Since the fellows' columns are so IMMENSE and their PAY so bad, the only remedy is to lengthen the articles. I hope that when you come to do 'Cavalry' you will spin it out as much as possible so that I can get rid of my DEBTS to those curs.
<br>In France things are splendid. The COOLNESS with which the <i>épiciers</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> responded to the news of the attempted assassination<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> has exasperated the fellow.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> The secret of this indifference of the <i>épiciers</i> is doubtless the unspoken desire of many of them that some sudden political event should get them out of their mess. The majority of the laddies had had their bills renewed by the Bank, Discount Association, etc., which were acting on the ORDERS of Boustrapa. However, to put off is not to write off. A large number of French bourgeois, with commercial ruin staring them in the face, are anxiously awaiting the day of reckoning. They now find themselves in much the same STATE as Boustrapa <i>before</i> the coup d'état.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> ANY POLITICAL PRETEXT FOR MAKING AN HONOURABLE EXIT WILL, CONSEQUENTLY, BE EAGERLY SEIZED UPON BY THE DAMNED FELLOWS JUST as it was 10 years ago. Boustrapa knows this and now wishes to act the real 'despot'. <i>Nous verrons?</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> If he pins his faith on Magnan, Castellane, etc., he will be left high and dry.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> <br>In my economic work I have now reached a point at which I could do with some information on practical matters from you, since nothing of the kind is to be found in theoretical writings. I mean, the <i>circulation</i> of capital—how it varies in various kinds of business; the effect of the same on profit and prices. If you can provide me with any information on the subject, it would be VERY welcome.
<br>Mr Lassalle, in his preface to <i>Die Philosophie Herakleitos des Dunklen von Ephesos,</i> says <i>inter alia</i>:
<br>'All but a small part of the same' (the book) 'was completed early in 1846, and I was on the point of putting the concluding touches to it when suddenly an interest of a different kind—how true in <i>every</i> respect is Sophocles' dictum:<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> <br>"iroXXà Ta ôeivà, xoùBèu àu6p&lt;!&gt;iToi&gt; Seiwrepou irèXei"
<br>— precipitated me into a welter of practical strife and prevented me over a period of nearly 10 years from devoting myself to the completion of this work.'
<br>Do you suppose that Sophocles' verse, put into German by Lassalle, means: 'There's no more frightful specimen of <i>human- kind</i> than the Countess Hatzfeldt!'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> <br><i>Salut.</i>
<br>Your
<br>K. M.

Orsini hoped thus to give an impetus to revolutionary actions in Europe and activate the struggle for Italy's unification. The attempt failed and Orsini was executed on 13 March of that year.—251, 255, 256, 257, 266, 271, 289</span>

His term as president was to expire early in May 1852, and according to the republic's Constitution a person could be elected to the post a second time only after a four-year interval. So Louis Bonaparte was in danger not only of losing his power and salary but also of being prosecuted for numerous debts.—256</span>

The divorce was agreed to in July 1851. Later, the countess received 300,000 talers under the property settlement.—23, 27, 227</span>

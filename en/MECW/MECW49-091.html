ENGELS TO STANISLAW MENDELSON</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London,] 31 March 1891</p>
<p>Dear Citizen Mendelson,</p>
<p>I have just received the letter a copy of which is enclosed here- with. 202 I have absolutely no knowledge of how things stand between you and Wrôblewski. It is a matter that does not concern me in the slightest.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>But in view of the delicate situation in which this letter has placed me, I have no choice — and I think you will agree with me</p>
<p>here — other than to inform you of the above and to advise Wrôblew- ski of your address. Please, therefore, come to an understanding with him direct.</p>
<p>I trust you have almost finished moving house. I know only too well how disagreeable these things are. Mrs Mendelson, to whom kindly remember me, must have had quite enough of it.</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p>Mrs Kautsky sends her regards both to you and to Mrs Mendelson.

ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 6 February 1861</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>You can write and tell Freiligrath that we don't need his tailor. Gumpert has obtained so much money in payment of his accounts that he can lend me the greater part of what is needed, to be repaid monthly £5 AT A TIME; the business has therefore been fixed up. Freiligrath can have the £30 any day and then he need only pay the expenses, which I shall likewise remit to him within 24 hours of my knowing the amount. As far as I'm concerned, he can write to me about it direct and you need not bother about this whole thing any more. I shall then make sure that I get at least part of the amount put down to the next financial year.</p>
<p>Your letters returned herewith. Not until my last had gone off, did I discover that, according to Dana's calculations, you have drawn payment for 19 more articles than they printed. Nevertheless, the fact remains that it is a dirty rotten business and, in this respect, the <i>Tribune</i> is behaving in true PENNY PAPER fashion. Its socialism amounts to nothing more than the highly contemptible petty bourgeois mania for getting the best out of a bargain.</p>
<p>Lassalle has become Isidor P-B<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>again. What sort of politician is this who thinks he has reduced a government to pulp because he has demonstrated that it was guilty of inconsistency in so trifling a matter? He must have some fine notions of parliamentary rule and what stands for law and justice under that rule. The man is incorrigible. One can only wonder what his monumental work in two volumes<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>will be about. At all events, anything can happen now that he has made such a complete volte-face <i>in re</i> Vogt.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>As to his little paper, if I were you, I would advise him to start a weekly in opposition to the <i>Preussisches Wochenblatt, Berliner Revue, Wochenschau des Nationalvereins</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>, etc. <i>La</i> Hatzfeldt's 300,000 talers, which both of them will hang on to very tightly indeed, and madame's Lucullan mode of life won't leave enough in the way of an income to keep a daily going. There'd soon be a dearth of cash. On the other hand, a weekly of this description doesn't cost much and it would certainly be a nice source of income for us. Lassalle would, of course, have to pay us properly, i.e., English rates, otherwise it's no go. Besides, the thing would come in very useful as a mouthpiece for us.</p>
<p>Our Prussian corporal<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>is suffering from a truly colossal attack of the shits. In every speech, the oaf talks of the impending life-and-death struggles.</p>
<p>The <i>Volunteer Journal</i> has published a revised version of my <i>Tribune</i> article on French armaments. This evening I shall, if possible send off a dozen copies to all the newspapers; the thing may create a sensation. I am also sending you one; since the scoundrels in New York are not at all interested in it now, and in any case it has been much shuffled about, no harm can be done. My pamphlet<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>comes out next week; all I have left to do is read a few proofs and write the preface.</p>
<p>Bücher seems to be behaving quite decently. Warm regards to your wife and children.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>Manchester, 26 June 1868
<br>Dear Moor,
<br>Yesterday evening, after I had written to you, I went to Gumpert to ask him about SCARLATINA, but found his house so full of patients and Solomonic persons that I couldn't really approach him. I therefore saw him again today and asked him whether he could recommend a doctor, since Allen was sick. He said the main thing was to have a man who, even if not excessively CLEVER, should really live nearby, should come 3-4 times a day at critical times, and always be on call. In his opinion, Lafargue is quite capable of handling this case properly, and if you want further assistance,
<br><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>Allen would be the best man to recommend one of the doctors in the vicinity. Apart from this, <i>fresh air</i> and PLENTY OF IT is the main thing; he himself usually prescribes washing with vinegar and water and disinfection of the house with chloride of lime; all this cannot, however, be decreed from a distance. In such acute sicknesses medicines are not really much use.
<br>You will have received the second ten pounds in 2 fivers which I sent you the day before yesterday. Enclosed a further five pounds S/K 46 795, and next week I shall send you some more.
<br>Incidentally, Gumpert did comfort me greatly and he confirmed that this year this sickness occurs in an exceptionally mild form.
<br>Lizzie is afraid that you might think that Tussy could have caught the germ of the sickness here and she has urged me to write that everybody here is healthy.
<br>Sincere greetings to your wife, the two patients,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Laura and Lafargue.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

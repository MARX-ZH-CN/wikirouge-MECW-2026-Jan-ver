ENGELS TO TH. SMART &amp; CO.</p>
<p>IN LESTER</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London, after 3 July 1872]</p>
<p>Mr Glaser is a highly respectable man well known in Brussels whom I have no doubt you will always find thoroughly straightforward and honest in all his dealings. As far as I know, he is not without some means and I should not hesitate, if I were in a position to do business with him, to trust him to the extent of a couple of £100.

MARX TO PYOTR LAVROV</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 7 October 1876</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p>I have just received a letter from Paris (from an employee<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>at Lachatre's booksellers) from which it transpires that the banning of <i>Capital</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>is simply a myth, a myth, moreover, assiduously disseminated by the police and by Mr Quest himself, the judicial administrator appointed by the late Buffet as sequestrator of Lachatre's booksellers.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Because it had been published under the state of siege, <i>Capital</i>—now that the state of siege has been raised—could only be banned by the regular courts, and the authorities fear a scandal of this kind. So they are seeking to suppress the book by underhand methods of intrigue.</p>
<p>You would greatly oblige me by advising me of the contents of the letter in which your agent Guyot mentions the banning of the book.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>Kovalevsky, for his part, has Russian friends in Paris prepared to attest that even Lachatre's booksellers has refused to sell them the work.</p>
<p>Armed with these proofs I shall be able to threaten Mr Quest—a great miser, albeit a millionaire—with legal proceedings and a demand for damages and interest. It is only through the force of such threats that he has finally ordered the printing of the last fifteen instalments.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>Under French law he is, vis-à-vis myself, merely Mr Lachatre's representative, his deputy, and must fulfil all the conditions laid down in my contract with the latter.</p>
<p>Last September's <i>Revue des deux Mondes</i> contains a so-called critique of <i>Capital</i> by Mr Laveleye.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>Only by reading it can one get any idea of the idiocy of our bourgeois 'thinkers'. Mr Laveleye is, however, naive enough to admit that, once you accept the doctrines of Adam Smith and Ricardo or even—<i>horribile dictu</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>—those of the Careys and the Bastiats, there is no means of escaping the subversive doctrines of <i>Capital.</i></p>
<p>I congratulate you on your LEADING ARTICLE in <i>Vpered!</i> on Pan-Slav lyricism in Russia.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>It is not only a masterpiece, it is above all a great act of moral courage.</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>Karl Marx</p>
<p>How is Smirnov's health progressing?

The delay in the publication, which took four years (1872-75), was caused, alongside the circumstances mentioned in this letter, by the growth of political reaction following the Paris Commune. In mid-1875, the French government transferred legal rights over Lachâtre's publishing house in Paris to Adolph Quest, an official who procrastinated with the printing of the last instalments of <i>Capital</i> and did his best to obstruct its dissemination.</span>

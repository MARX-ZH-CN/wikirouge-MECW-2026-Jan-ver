ENGELS TO FILIPPO TURATI</p>
<p>IN MILAN</p>
<p>London, 30 January 1893</p>
<p>Dear citizen Turati,</p>
<p>You will have a few words of introduction tomorrow, if possible.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>However, I would ask you not to attach to the 1848 Manifesto the 1884 programme of the English Socialist League. 136 The Manifesto is a historic document, <i>sui generis.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and if you attach to it a document dated forty years later, you will give the latter a special character. 108 Moreover, I cannot at the moment find the English original for comparison, because I have not seen it since it first appeared, and I know nothing about the programmes and other publications of the Socialist League, a society which has rapidly become anarchist, so that all those members who did not want to take part in this change of front (the Avelings, Bax, etc.) have withdrawn. As a result the League that has been dead for some time is now only referred to here as an <i>anarchist</i> society. You can imagine, therefore, to what <i>quid pro quo</i> a reprint of the original programme together with the 1848 Manifesto might lead.</p>
<p>Greetings to Mme Kulishov and yourself from Mme Kautsky and yours truly,</p>
<p>F. Engels

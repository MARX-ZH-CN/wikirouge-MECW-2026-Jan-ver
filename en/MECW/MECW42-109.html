MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 15 November 1865</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>You must excuse me for not most gratefully acknowledging receipt of the £15 until today and for not writing to you until <i>tomorrow.</i> I am so pressed that I cannot manage it today.</p>
<p>Little Jenny has diphtheria, but I hope it will soon be over. As soon as you have read the enclosed letter—whose manner and style do, incidentally, stand out most favourably from those of the Rhineland workers—please be so good as to send it back. Courtesy requires that it should be answered.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Salut</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. Marx

No rights without duties, no duties without rights' (see present edition, Vol. 20, p. 15).</span>

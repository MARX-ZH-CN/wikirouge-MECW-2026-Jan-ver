<br>TO THE EDITOR OF THE STANDARD

</center><br>In your leader on the "International" (of the 19 June) <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> you say:
<br>"Of the two programmes (that of London and that of Paris) recently issued in favour of the Commune <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> that of the Paris branch has the merit of being the more honest and the more outspoken."
<br>Unfortunately, the "Paris" manifesto has been issued not by our
<br>Paris Branch, but by the "Versailles Police".
<br>You say:
<br>"The London Internationalists insist no less earnestly than their Paris brethren that 'the old society must perish and ought to perish'. They speak of the burning of the public buildings and the shooting of the hostages as 'a gigantic effort to bring society down'—which, although unsuccessful once, will be persevered in until it succeeds."
<br>Now the General Council of this Association summons you to quote the exact pages and lines of our Address where the words attributed by you to us do occur!

MARX TO FERDINAND FREILIGRATH</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 26 January 1852 28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Freiligrath,</p>
<p>The verse you sent me to have a look at is delicious and expresses the <i>corpus delicti</i> in a masterly manner, but I believe it impairs the effect of the whole.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <i>D'abord</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> is Kinkel a 'German poet? I and a great many other <i>bons gens</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> venture modestly to express some doubt upon this point. Then: will it not detract from the significant contrast between the 'German poet' and the 'commercial' Babylon to deal yet again with the contrast between the 'free' and the 'servile' poet? The more so as the relationship of the puffed-up <i>man of letters</i> to the world that confronts the 'poet' is already depicted exhaustively in <i>Andersen</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> Since, as I see it, there is no intrinsic need to bring in Kinkel at this point, your verse would only provide our opponents with the opportunity of coming down on it as the expression of personal pique or rivalry. But as it is so felicitous and ought not to be wasted, you will—if you agree with my view in other respects—certainly have a chance of using it in a different context, in one of the later poetical letters. For the sketch is delicious.</p>
<p>Since Engels-Weerth have not returned the copy of your first poem<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> which I sent them, all I had to offer red Wolff<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> yesterday were the few bits I knew by heart which, however, sufficed to bring on one of his fits of enthusiasm.</p>
<p><i>Quant à notre ami</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> Ebner,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> he has undoubtedly had letters from Pieper, the best proof being that Pieper possesses a reply from him. Besides, he wrote him another long letter quite recently, excusing my silence on the grounds of my indisposition.</p>
<p>I have had a letter from Bermbach consisting of some 30 lines. He asks why he has not heard from me for so long. The answer is quite simple. I send about half a sheet to Cologne and, after a very long delay, receive in return a few lines, none of which ever answers my questions. For instance, never a word about Daniels' state of health and the like. You will get this letter as soon as it comes back from Manchester. Engels is going to use it for articles for the English papers.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> There is nothing of importance in the scrawl save the following: The Board of indicting magistrates, <i>remarquez le bien</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> in view of the fact 'that there was no actual evidence of an indictable offence', rules that the investigation must start <i>all over again</i>. First then, on the basis of some stupid presumption, you have to spend 9 months in jug. Next, it transpires that there are no legal grounds for your being in jug. Conclusion: You must remain in jug until the examining magistrate finds himself à <i>même</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> to present 'actual evidence of an indictable offence' and, if the 'actual evidence' is not forthcoming, in gaol you remain until you rot.</p>
<p>Such shameless poltroonery is unbelievable. The main fault lies with the wretched 'Press' which utters not a word. A few articles in the <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i>, the <i>National-Zeitung</i> and the <i>Breslauer Zeitung</i>—and the Cologne Board of indicting magistrates would never have dared do anything of the sort. But the liberals and democrats, like the curs they are, rejoice at the removal of their communist rivals. Did we not stand up for the Temmes and every imaginable variety of democratic riff-raff whenever they found themselves in conflict with the police and the courts?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> Not once does Kinkel, for whom Becker was a hearth and Bürgers a haven,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> render them any thanks in the <i>Lithographische Korrespondenz</i> which he sustains with American funds. <i>Les canailles!</i></p>
<p>If I knew of a safe bourgeois address in Cologne, I would write to Mrs Daniels and endeavour to reassure her to some extent about political conditions. From what Pieper tells me, it would seem that every counter-revolutionary advance is exploited by the 'worthy citizens' to alarm and vex her.</p>
<p>Enclosed a note from Miss Jenny to Master Wolfgang.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The reference is to the verse added by Freiligrath to the second poem which he had written for Weydemeyer's newspaper on 23 January 1852 (see Note 13) and sent to Marx on 25 January 1852 to have his opinion: Das heißt: dafern Du Babel nicht beglücktest Endlos mit Briefen, Karten, Inseraten, (Plakaten gar!)—dafern Du Dich nicht bücktest, Und um ein Wörtlein nur von Deinen Thaten Feig vor der Presse krochst und so Dich drücktest, (Gleich Virtuosen oder Akrobaten,) Daß Dich zuletzt, nach manchem sauern Schritt, Wirklich in Holz die Illustrierte schnitt! Here Freiligrath alludes to the fact that Kinkel, by flattery and fawning, succeeded in having an article about himself, together with a portrait, printed in the Illustrated News on 30 November 1850. When the poem was published, the additional verse about Kinkel was not included, which means that Freiligrath complied with Marx's recommendation</span>

<li id="cite_note-4"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-4">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Freiligrath's second poem contained verses addressed to Hans Andersen which Marx mentions here. They were prompted by Freiligrath's grudge against Andersen who, while in London, did not recognise him when they chanced to meet. He felt all the more bitter because the Danish storyteller had enjoyed his hospitality in Germany. When the poem was published in Die Revolution the editors supplied the following note to Andersen's name: 'Herr Andersen himself appears here not merely as an individual but as the epitome of a peculiar type of literary lion and parasite to which the revolution seemed to have dealt the death-blow but which is again coming up and boastfully asserting itself everywhere.' In Freüigraths gesammelte Dichtungen published in Stuttgart in 1870 (Bd. 4, S. 5-6) the poem was printed without the 11 verses devoted to Hans Christian Andersen</span>

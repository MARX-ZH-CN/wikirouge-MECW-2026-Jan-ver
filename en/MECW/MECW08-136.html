<p>Cologne, November 14. Upon the news that Karl Marx, the rédacteur en chef of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, had received a summons to appear this morning before the examining magistrate's court, a considerable crowd of people gathered at the Court of Appeal to demonstrate their sympathy and await the outcome. When Karl Marx reappeared he was greeted with loud applause and accompanied to the Eiser Hall, where he said a few words of thanks for the people's sympathy and stated that he had merely been questioned in the final hearing of the Hecker case, for Herr Hecker, former Public Prosecutor, now Chief Public Prosecutor, believed he had been denounced as a republican by Karl Marx through the publication in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung of a document signed "Hecker".<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>

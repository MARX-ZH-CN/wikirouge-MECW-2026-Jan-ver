ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY</p>
<p>IN ZURICH</p>
<p>[London,] 13 October 1884</p>
<p>In great haste. The sheets have been returned to Dietz after resto-ration of h, tz and the botched foreign words.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Wrote telling Dietz that both of you<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> had protested and that I had concurred and had made the above-mentioned reinstatements in agreement with you. I would, I said, no more have spelling imposed upon me than I would a woman and hence if the proofs were not corrected in accordance with my demands, I should 1) call for the deletion of all my notes and 2) not provide a preface,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> as I couldn't possibly have two kinds of spelling for my stuff.</p>
<p>Do you really not wish to put your names on the title page as trans-lators? The title should in any case be so worded that I simply appear as the author of the notes and preface unless you expressly insist on the revision mentioned, though I consider this quite unnecessary.</p>
<p>Another whole day has been wasted thanks to these asininities. Right in the middle of election time,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> what's more.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

The book included, in place of Marx's preface, his article 'On Proudhon' (see present edition, Vol. 20) and two appendices: an excerpt from Marx's work <i>A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</i> on the theory of the English socialist John Gray (see present edition, Vol. 29, pp. 320-23), and a translation of the 'Speech on the Question of Free Trade' (Vol. 6). At one time <i>Die Neue Zeit</i> was printed in a distinctive orthography proposed by Bruno Geiser.</span>

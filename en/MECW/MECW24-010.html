<p><i>To August Bebel in Zwickau</i>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Engels' letter to August Bebel written between March 18 and 28, 1875 is closely connected with Marx's <i>Critique of the Gotha Programme</i> and is traditionally published together with the latter work. It conveyed the joint opinion of Marx and Engels concerning the fusion of two German workers' parties, the Eisenachers and the Lassalleans, scheduled for early 1875. The immediate reason for the letter was the publication of the draft programme of the future united Social-Democratic Workers' Party of Germany <i>(Programm der deutschen Arbeiterpartei)</i> in <i>Der Volksstaat</i> (the organ of the Eisenachers) and the <i>Neuer Social-Demokrat</i> (the organ of the Lassalleans) on March 7, 1875. The draft programme was approved with slight changes by the unity congress at Gotha on May 22-27, 1875, and came to be known as the Gotha Programme.

<h4 class="mw-headline" id="ME24-10-2">London, March 18-28, 1875</h4><a id="London,_March_18-28,_1875"></a>
<p>Dear Bebel,</p>
<p>I have received your letter of February 23 and am glad to hear that you are in such good bodily health.</p>
<p>You ask me what we think of the unification affair. We are, unfortunately, in exactly the same boat as yourself. Neither Liebknecht nor anyone else has let us have any kind of information, and hence we too know only what is in the papers — not that there was anything in them until a week or so ago, when the draft programme appeared. That astonished us not a little, I must say.</p>
<p>Our party had so often held out a conciliatory hand to the Lassalleans, or at least proffered co-operation, only to be rebuffed so often and so contemptuously by the Hasenclevers, Hasselmanns and Tolckes as to lead any child to the conclusion that, should these gentlemen now come and themselves proffer conciliation, they must be in a hell of a dilemma. Knowing full well what these people are like, however, it behoves us to make the most of that dilemma and insist on every conceivable guarantee that might prevent these people from restoring, at our party's expense, their shattered reputation in general working-class opinion. They should be given an exceedingly cool and cautious reception, and union be made dependent on the degree of their readiness to abandon their sectarian slogans and their state aid,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>and to accept in its essentials the Eisenach Programme of 1869<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>or an improved edition of it adapted to the present day. Our party has <i>absolutely nothing to learn</i> from the Lassalleans in the theoretical sphere, i.e. the crux of the matter where the programme is concerned, but the Lassalleans doubtless have something to learn from the party; the first prerequisite for union was that they cease to be sectarians, Lassalleans, i.e. that, first and foremost, they should, if not wholly relinquish the universal panacea of state aid, at least admit it to be a secondary provisional measure alongside and amongst many others recognised as possible. The draft programme shows that our people, while infinitely superior to the Lassallean leaders in matters of theory, are far from being a match for them where political guile is concerned; once again the "honest men"<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>have been cruelly done in the eye by the dishonest.</p>
<p>To begin with, they adopt the high-sounding but historically false Lassallean dictum: in relation to the working class all other classes are only one reactionary mass. This proposition is true only in certain exceptional instances, for example in the case of a revolution by the proletariat, e.g. the Commune, or in a country in which not only has the bourgeoisie constructed state and society after its own image but the democratic petty bourgeoisie, in its wake, has already carried that reconstruction to its logical conclusion. If, for instance, in Germany, the democratic petty bourgeoisie were part of this reactionary mass, then how could the Social-Democratic Workers' Party have gone hand in hand with it, with the People's Party,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>for years on end? How could the <i>Volksstaat</i> derive virtually all its political content from the petty-bourgeois democratic <i>Frankfurter Zeitung</i>? And how can one explain the adoption in this same programme of no less than seven demands that coincide exactly and word for word with the programme of the People's Party and of petty-bourgeois democracy? I mean the seven political demands, 1 to 5 and 1 to 2, of which there is not one that is not bourgeois-democratic.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Secondly, the principle that the workers' movement is an international one is, to all intents and purposes, utterly denied in respect of the present, and this by men who, for the space of five years and under the most difficult conditions, upheld that principle in the most laudable manner. The German workers' position in the van of the European movement rests <i>essentially</i> on their genuinely international attitude during the war<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>; no other proletariat would have behaved so well. And now this principle is to be denied by them at a moment when, everywhere abroad, workers are stressing it all the more by reason of the efforts made by governments to suppress every attempt at its practical application in an organisation! And what is left of the internationalism of the workers' movement? The dim prospect — not even of subsequent co-operation among European workers with a view to their liberation — nay, but of a future "international brotherhood of peoples" — of your Peace League bourgeois "United States of Europe"!<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>There was, of course, no need whatever to mention the International as such. But at the very least there should have been no going back on the programme of 1869, and some sort of statement to the effect that, <i>though first of all</i> the German workers' party is acting within the limits set by its political frontiers (it has no right to speak in the name of the European proletariat, especially when what it says is wrong), it is nevertheless conscious of its solidarity with the workers of all other countries and will, as before, always be ready to meet the obligations that solidarity entails. Such obligations, even if one does not definitely proclaim or regard oneself as part of the "International," consist for example in aid, abstention from blacklegging during strikes, making sure that the party organs keep German workers informed of the movement abroad, agitation against impending or incipient dynastic wars and, during such wars, an attitude such as was exemplarily maintained in 1870 and 1871, etc.</p>
<p>Thirdly, our people have allowed themselves to be saddled with the Lassallean "iron law of wages" which is based on a completely outmoded economic view, namely that on average the workers receive only the minimum wage because, according to the Malthusian theory of population, there are always too many workers (such was Lassalle's reasoning). Now in <i>Capital</i> Marx has amply demonstrated that the laws governing wages are very complex, that, according to circumstances, now this law, now that, holds sway, that they are therefore by no means iron but are, on the contrary, exceedingly elastic, and that the subject really cannot be dismissed in a few words, as Lassalle imagined. Malthus' argument, upon which the law Lassalle derived from him and Ricardo (whom he misinterpreted) is based, as that argument appears, for instance, on p. 5 of the <i>Arbeiterlesebuch</i>, where it is quoted from another pamphlet of Lassalle's,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>is exhaustively refuted by Marx in the section on "Accumulation of Capital." Thus, by adopting the Lassallean "iron law" one commits oneself to a false proposition and false reasoning in support of the same.</p>
<p>Fourthly, as its <i>one and only social</i> demand, the programme puts forward — Lassallean state aid in its starkest form, as stolen by Lassalle from Buchez.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>And this, after Bracke has so ably demonstrated the sheer futility of that demand; after almost all if not all, of our party speakers have, in their struggle against the Lassalleans, been compelled to make a stand against this "state aid"! Our party could hardly demean itself further. Internationalism sunk to the level of Amand Goegg, socialism to that of the bourgeois republican Buchez, who <i>confronted the socialists</i> with this demand in order to supplant them!</p>
<p>But "state aid" in the Lassallean sense of the word is, after all, at most only <i>one</i> measure among many others for the attainment of an end here lamely described as "paving the way for the solution of the social question," as though in our case there were still a social <i>question</i> that remained <i>unsolved</i> in theory! Thus, if you were to say: The German workers' party strives to abolish wage labour and hence class distinctions by introducing co-operative production into industry and agriculture, and on a national scale; it is in favour of any measure calculated to attain that end! — then no Lassallean could possibly object.</p>
<p>Fifthly, there is absolutely no mention of the organisation of the working class as a class through the medium of trade unions. And that is a point of the utmost importance, this being the proletariat's true class organisation in which it fights its daily battles with capital, in which it trains itself and which nowadays can no longer simply be smashed, even with reaction at its worst (as presently in Paris). Considering the importance this organisation is likewise assuming in Germany, it would in our view be indispensable to accord it some mention in the programme and, possibly, to leave some room for it in the organisation of the party.</p>
<p>All these things have been done by our people to oblige the Lassalleans. And what have the others conceded? That a host of somewhat muddled and <i>purely democratic demands</i> should figure in the programme, some of them being of a purely fashionable nature — for instance "legislation by the people" such as exists in Switzerland and does more harm than good, if it can be said to do anything at all. <i>Administration</i> by the people — that would at least be something. Similarly omitted is the first prerequisite of all liberty — that all officials be responsible for all their official actions to every citizen before the ordinary courts and in accordance with common law. That demands such as freedom of science and freedom of conscience figure in every liberal bourgeois programme and seem a trifle out of place here is something I shall not enlarge upon.</p>
<p>The free people's state is transformed into the free state. Grammatically speaking, a free state is one in which the state is free vis-à-vis its citizens, a state, that is, with a despotic government. All the palaver about the state ought to be dropped, especially after the Commune, which had ceased to be a state in the true sense of the term. The <i>people's state</i> has been flung in our teeth <i>ad nauseam</i> by the anarchists, although Marx's anti-Proudhon piece and after it the <i>Communist Manifesto</i> declare outright that, with the introduction of the socialist order of society, the state will dissolve of itself and disappear. Now, since the state is merely a transitional institution of which use is made in the struggle, in the revolution, to keep down one's enemies by force, it is utter nonsense to speak of a free people's state; so long as the proletariat still <i>makes use</i> of the state, it makes use of it, not for the purpose of freedom, but of keeping down its enemies and, as soon as there can be any question of freedom, the state as such ceases to exist. We would therefore suggest that <i>Gemeinwesen</i> ["commonalty"] be universally substituted for <i>state;</i> it is a good old German word that can very well do service for the French "Commune."</p>
<p>"The elimination of all social and political inequality," rather than "the abolition of all class distinctions," is similarly a most dubious expression. As between one country, one province and even one place and another, living conditions will always evince a <i>certain</i> inequality which may be reduced to a minimum but never wholly eliminated. The living conditions of Alpine dwellers will always be different from those of the plainsmen. The concept of a socialist society as a realm of <i>equality is</i> a one-sided French concept deriving from the old "liberty, equality, fraternity," a concept which was justified in that, in its own time and place, it signified a <i>phase of development</i>, but which, like all the one-sided ideas of earlier socialist schools, ought now to be superseded, since they produce nothing but mental confusion, and more accurate ways of presenting the matter have been discovered.</p>
<p>I shall desist, although almost every word in this programme, a programme which is, moreover, insipidly written, lays itself open to criticism. It is such that, should it be adopted, Marx and I could <i>never</i> recognise a <i>new</i> party set up on that basis and shall have to consider most seriously what attitude — public as well as private — we should adopt towards it.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>Remember that abroad <i>we</i> are held responsible for any and every statement and action of the German Social-Democratic Workers' Party. E.g. by Bakunin in his work <i>Statehood and Anarchy</i>, in which we are made to answer for every injudicious word spoken or written by Liebknecht since the inception of the <i>Demokratisches Wochenblatt.</i> People imagine that we run the whole show from here, whereas you know as well as I do that we have hardly ever interfered in the least with internal party affairs, and then only in an attempt to make good, as far as possible, what we considered to have been blunders — and <i>only theoretical</i> blunders at that. But, as you yourself will realise, this programme marks a turning-point which may very well force us to renounce any kind of responsibility in regard to the party that adopts it.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, less importance attaches to the official programme of a party than to what it does. But a <i>new</i> programme is after all a banner planted in public, and the outside world judges the party by it. Hence, whatever happens there should be no going-back, as there is here, on the Eisenach programme. It should further be considered what the workers of other countries will think of this programme; what impression will be created by this genuflection on the part of the entire German socialist proletariat before Lassalleanism.</p>
<p>I am, moreover, convinced that a union on <i>this</i> basis would not last a year. Are the best minds of our party to descend to repeating, parrot-fashion, Lassallean maxims concerning the iron law of wages and state aid? I'd like to see you, for one, thus employed! And were they to do so, their audiences would hiss them off the stage. And I feel sure that it is precisely on <i>these</i> bits of the programme that the Lassalleans are insisting, like Shylock the Jew on his pound of flesh. The split will come; but we shall have "made honest men" again of Hasselmann, Hasenclever and Tolcke and Co.; we shall emerge from the split weaker and the Lassalleans stronger; our party will have lost its political virginity and will never again be able to come out whole-heartedly against the Lassallean maxims which for a time it inscribed on its own banner; and then, should the Lassalleans again declare themselves to be the sole and most genuine workers' party and our people to be bourgeois, the programme would be there to prove it. All the socialist measures in it are <i>theirs</i>, and <i>our</i> party has introduced nothing save the demands of that petty-bourgeois democracy which it has <i>itself</i> described in that same programme as part of the "reactionary mass"!</p>
<p>I had held this letter back in view of the fact that you would only be released on April 1, in honour of Bismarck's birthday,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup>not wanting to expose it to the risk of interception in the course of an attempt to smuggle it in. Well, I have just had a letter from Bracke, who has also felt grave doubts about the programme and asks for our opinion. I shall therefore send this letter to him for forwarding, so that he can read it without my having to write the whole thing over again. I have, by the way, also spoken my mind to Ramm; to Liebknecht I wrote but briefly. I cannot forgive his not having told us a <i>single word</i> about the whole business (whereas Ramm and others believed he had given us exact information) until it was, in a manner of speaking, too late. True, this has always been his wont — hence the large amount of disagreeable correspondence which we, both Marx and myself, have had with him, but this time it really is too bad, and <i>we definitely shan't act in concert with him.</i></p>
<p>Do see that you manage to come here in the summer; you would, of course, stay with me and, if the weather is fine, we might spend a day or two taking sea baths, which would really do you good after your long spell in jail.</p>
<p>Ever your friend,</p>

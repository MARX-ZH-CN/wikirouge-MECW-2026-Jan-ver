ENGELS TO MARIA MENDELSON</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 24 January 1893<br>
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Mme Mendelson,</p>
<p>Would you be so kind as to send me another half-dozen copies of the circular in reply to the one issued by Free Russia? I would like to send it to my friends in Germany and elsewhere; perhaps you would be so good as to tell me if it has been sent to Bebel and <i>Vorwärts.</i></p>
<p>Is there a printing error on page 1, line 4? Is Dragomanov recommending the <i>P</i>olonisation of Lithuania, or its colonisation (by Russian colonists)?</p>
<p>Friendly greetings from myself and Mme Kautsky.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>F. Engels</p>
<p>Mme Kautsky is suffering from a cold and an attack of neuralgia, otherwise she would already have called to see you.

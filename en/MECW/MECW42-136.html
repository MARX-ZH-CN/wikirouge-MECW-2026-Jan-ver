MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 2 March 1866</p>
<p>DEAR FRED, The thing will soon be all over now. I think that by tomorrow or the day after at the latest I shall not merely be able to rise from my bed, but to go out, and that with this last malignant cur the series of carbuncles is finished, FOR THIS SEASON. I also feel much better again GENERALLY. This last attack was atrocious. It did not merely put paid to any work, but to any reading, too, EXCEPT Walter Scott.</p>
<p>I found the arsenic not at all unpleasant to begin with (when the taste of the CINNAMON predominated). Now I am beginning to find its specific flavour most repugnant. Otherwise, I believe it was helpful. I took it 3 TIMES A DAY from the outset.</p>
<p>How are things with your contributions for <i>The Commonwealth?</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> And with John Watts 'ON MACHINERY'?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The sofa to which I have been confined for 9 days now is in my study, but right by the window, so that at certain times of day, e. g. as at this moment, T can enjoy a most refreshing breeze.</p>
<p>You have no further cause for anxiety now, but AS FAR AS ACTUAL OUTBREAKS ARE CONCERNED you can regard the business as terminated.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>Little Tussy 'SENDS HER BEST COMPLIMENTS TO HER CHIMP'.

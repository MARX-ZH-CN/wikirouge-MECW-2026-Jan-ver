MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 19 April 1870</p>
<p><i>IN ALL HASTE</i></p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>I am sending you 2 PARLIAMENTARIES ON IRELAND, and the latest <i>Egalité, ditto La Solidarité.</i> From the enclosed letter from Perret,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>ex-secretary of the <i>Federal Comité</i> in Geneva—which I must have back <i>by Friday</i>—you will see how the Muscovite beast<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>is acting. He was naturally forced to appeal also—which he did—to the CENTRAL COUNCIL<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>through his <i>secretaire général</i> Robert. I also enclose this letter.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>What do you think we should do about these fellows?</p>
<p>MR WILLIAMS SENDS YOU HIS COMPLIMENTS. ONE OF HIS ARTICLES HE HAD SENT TO <i>Reynolds's.</i> HE WENT TO TOWN TO FIND ANOTHER COPY FOR YOU, BUT IT WAS NOT TO BE GOT. TWO further ARTICLES<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>together with OTHER <i>Marseillaises</i> HE SHALL FORWARD YOU THIS WEEK.</p>
<p>My wife took the <i>£5</i> to Dupont this morning. BEST THANKS FOR IT. HIS WIFE IS DYING IN THE HOSPITAL.</p>
<p>I have visited Schapper. Bad inflammation of the lungs, very emaciated, but perhaps he can still be saved.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>We shall put a spoke in Bakunin's wheel in the <i>Marseillaise</i> through <i>Flourens,</i> who has seen through the 'FRENCH BRANCH' 7 2 and annexed himself to us. HE IS A MAN OF VERY GREAT RESOLUTION. LEARNED. TOO SANGUINE.

The letter, which was signed by the Federal Committee Secretary F. Robert, also informed the General Council about the establishment of a new <i>La Solidarité</i> newspaper by the Bakuninists.</span>

ENGELS TO RUDOLF ENGELS</p>
<p>IN ENGELSKIRCHEN</p>
<p>London, 10 March 1871</p>
<p>Dear Rudolf,</p>
<p>Since I am not yet acquainted with any lawyer here who is reliably informed or especially competent in commercial affairs, I have decided after some reflection that the best thing would be to write to the man in Manchester who made the contract with Funke on your behalf. I was quite clear in my mind about the issue at stake, but in matters of English law it is always better not to rely on common sense. However, on this occasion, the lawyer said: <i>law and common sense agree; the retirement of one of the partners in the German firm, from</i> the German firm, in no way affects the firm in England, nor can the firm in England have any voice in the matter. On the other hand no member of the English firm can retire before the expiration of the term without the consent of the other members of the same concern.<i></i></p>
<p>Therefore (1) Adolf's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> position in the firm of R. Funke &amp; Co. remains unaltered even though he has left the firm of Ermen &amp; Engels in Barmen; and (2) his resignation from R. Funke &amp; Co. requires not just his agreement, but also the agreement of <i>Funke,</i> a point that may not have occurred to you.</p>
<p>Since these affairs affect Adolf, too, and since I cannot take sides on this matter, I am writing to him in the same terms to-day.</p>
<p>I purchased this information at a cost of 10/6d., which equals 3.15 thalers, and would be glad if you could credit me with it.</p>
<p>I find it quite natural that Adolf should want to retire from the business as soon as he can. The winter in Engelskirchen is fearfully boring and <i>you</i> will not take it amiss that he should long for some other entertainment than endless family drinking-sessions. I am only astonished that he stood it there for so long; I would have kicked up a fuss much sooner and more often. It is all very well for you and Hermann<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> to talk, but you both jib at the idea of moving to Engelskirchen, and you cannot persuade me that it is just because you know nothing of the manufacturing process. You could learn it up after all, it would do you both good. Adolf can find many pleasant and congenial occupations for himself even without the business, and anyone who can do that is quite right to withdraw as quickly as possible. You must have been prepared for this eventuality long since, and if it now arises, it can only be in your interest for him to leave as soon as possible. I do not understand therefore how you should find such major grounds for complaint. Let Adolf go his own way, resolve the dispute as friends and make the necessary arrangements to meet the new situation, one which will give a higher percentage yield to each of you.</p>
<p>Gottfried<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> will not suffer any great inconvenience; the old MILL in West Lane was empty and available, machinery is also easily procured. In Manchester one can get quite a few things done, etc., by other people, so you should not entertain any exaggerated hopes. Moreover, it is self-evident that I am under a moral obligation not to do anything to harm a former <i>associé</i> who has given me a round sum in return for my own resignation. To what purpose then do you have agents and travellers? If they do their duty you do not need any further information.</p>
<p>I rather doubt that the present sympathy with France (both here and fairly generally all over the world) stems from the fact that the French were given the greater thrashing. However, this much is certain: if the Prussians should be given another thrashing at a later stage (which is not at all improbable) people will laugh at them, rather than sympathise with them. The fact is that you cannot see beyond the end of your noses; but the hangover will follow the victory celebrations soon enough, and then you will find it hard to take much pleasure in yourselves. For all your power and glory you are as firmly 'in the thrall of Olmütz' as ever. Olmütz was made in Warsaw,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> where your sovereign lord, the Emperor of Russia,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> commanded you to bow to Austria and the Federal Diet, and now that you have made sure that for many years to come France (which after all lies on your border) will remain your enemy, Russia will be your only protector and will soon make you pay for that protection. You are more firmly in the grip of Russian domination than ever before.</p>
<p>Would you kindly give my mother<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> my warmest wishes and say that I shall be writing to her shortly. Give my regards to your wife and children and all my brothers and sisters and all their encumbrances.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Frederick

Volume I included despatches by Minister Emile Ollivier in which he ordered the arrest of members of the International. These measures by the Bonapartist government were connected with preparations for a plebiscite called for 8 May 1870 (see Note 104). On the eve of the plebiscite, members of the Paris Federation of the International were arrested and charged with conspiring to assassinate Napoleon III. Persecution of members of the International began simultaneously in Lyons, Rouen, Marseilles and other cities. The third trial of members of the Paris Federation was held from 22 June to 5 July 1870; the detainees were sentenced for being members of the International.—116</span>

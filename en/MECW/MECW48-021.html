ENGELS TO GERSON TRIER<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>IN COPENHAGEN
<br>London, 23 March 1887<br>
122 Regent's Park Road, N.W.
<br>Dear Mr Trier.
<br>The three copybooks of your MS. just received with thanks, though I regret that it will not be possible for me to have a look at them before the end of this week. I shall, however, set about it as soon as the slight inflammation of the eyes, from which I am now suffering, permits and shall be glad if you will come and see me on your return from Copenhagen.
<br>Yours very sincerely,
<br>F. Engels

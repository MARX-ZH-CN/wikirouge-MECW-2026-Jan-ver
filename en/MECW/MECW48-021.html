ENGELS TO GERSON TRIER<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN COPENHAGEN</p>
<p>London, 23 March 1887<br>
122 Regent's Park Road, N.W.</p>
<p>Dear Mr Trier.</p>
<p>The three copybooks of your MS. just received with thanks, though I regret that it will not be possible for me to have a look at them before the end of this week. I shall, however, set about it as soon as the slight inflammation of the eyes, from which I am now suffering, permits and shall be glad if you will come and see me on your return from Copenhagen.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>F. Engels

<p><i>To Engels in Geneva</i>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On 26 September 1848 the Prussian authorities, fearing the growing revolutionary-democratic movement, declared a state of siege in Cologne (it was lifted on 2 October). By order of the military command political organisations and associations were banned, the civic militia disbanded, democratic newspapers, including the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung, </i>suspended, and an order issued for the arrest of Engels and a few other editors. Engels and Dronke had to leave Cologne. For a time Engels lived in hiding in Barmen. On 5 October Engels and Dronke arrived in Paris after a short stay in Belgium whence they were expelled by the police. Dronke remained in the French capital and wrote to the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> from there, while Engels started on foot for Switzerland via the south-west of France. About 24 October he arrived in Genoa and at the beginning of November moved to Lausanne (these facts served as a basis for establishing the date of this letter and those by Marx which followed and were not dated); Engels arrived in Neuchâtel on 7 November and in Berne on 9 November. He stayed there until mid-January 1849 when it was possible for him to return to Germany.</p>
<p>Engels' letter written to Marx from Geneva has not been found.

<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>As your letter only arrived this evening, there is no time left to make enquiries about bills. I haven't even time to go home. I send you the enclosed, which happens to be to hand and, in addition, a draft of 50 talers from Schulz on a citizen of Geneva [J Köhler] where you might also obtain help in other ways.</p>
<p>I sent 50 talers to you and Dronke in Paris a long time ago and at the same time sent your passport to Gigot in Brussels.</p>
<p>Since 11 October the paper has been appearing again, quite unchanged. It is not the time now to go into details, as haste is necessary. As soon as you can, write some news items and longer articles. Now that everyone save Weerth is away, Freiligrath having only joined us a few days ago, I am up to my eyes and unable to undertake work of a more detailed kind, and in addition the public prosecutor's office is doing all it can to rob me of my time.</p>
<p><i>Write by return</i>. Shall I send your underclothing, etc.? Plasmann ready to do so immediately.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Your father has paid him, by the way.</p>
<p>By the way, your old man has written to Gigot asking where you are. He wants, so he says, to send you some money. I sent him your address.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. Marx
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[From Louis Schulz]<br>P. S. Should be obliged if you would open enclosed letter to J. Köhler by the Lake, or rue du Rhône, and deliver same, whereupon he will pay you 250 fr. for my account against sight draft on me. Friendly greetings.<br>Louis Schulz

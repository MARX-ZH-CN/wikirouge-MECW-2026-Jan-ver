ENGELS TO NATALIE LIEBKNECHT</p>
<p>IN BORSDORF NEAR LEIPZIG</p>
<p>London, 25 September 1886<br>
122 Regent's Park Road</p>
<p>Dear Mrs Liebknecht,</p>
<p>At Liebknecht's behest, I am sending you herewith an Imperial bank-note for 100 marks, No. 1236179<sup>d</sup>, Berlin, 3 September 1883, which he left with me on his departure. He also gave me reason to hope that you might come over in December, to welcome him here at my house. We should all be delighted if this were to happen, in which case I trust you will share our humble board and look upon my house as your own.</p>
<p>From what we have heard so far, out friends' tour has been most successful.</p>
<p>With sincere regards to you and the children,</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>F. Engels
</p>

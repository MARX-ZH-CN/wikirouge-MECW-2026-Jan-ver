MARX TO J. M. WEBER</p>
<p>IN BERLIN</p>
<p>London, 27 March 1860<br>9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park,<br>Haverstock Hill</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>I am enclosing herewith the <i>last</i> two documents needed to complete what has already been sent. The <i>first</i> is a letter from the editor-in-chief of the <i>New-York Tribune</i> to me.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>I have included a German translation.</p>
<p>The <i>second</i> document is highly important in that it proves that the wretched Cherval, <i>alias</i> Nugent, <i>alias</i> Cramer, far from being in touch with me when he was <i>in Geneva,</i> was hounded out of that city as a result of my book about the Communist trial in Cologne.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The letter is from Johann Philipp Becker in Paris (Becker fled after the affair of 1830/31, in 1848/49 he first commanded the volunteers in Baden, then he was colonel of the revolutionary army in Baden and the Palatinate; he is now a business man in Paris and, so to speak, the doyen of the German émigrés) and is directed to Rheinländer, a merchant in London, with whom he has business connections. Mr Rheinländer, who is an acquaintance of mine, was good enough to let me have the letter.</p>
<p>Apart from this letter, I have also sent you:</p>
<p>1. Dated 21 Feb. Power of attorney, together with enclosures.</p>
<p>2. Dated 24 Feb. A letter, together with enclosures.</p>
<p>3. Dated 3 March. Two packages with enclosures.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>I now look forward to receiving by return of post, firstly, a confirmation that these various letters, etc., have arrived, secondly, some news about the progress of the libel suit.</p>
<p>I am, Sir,</p>
<p>Your most obedient Servant,</p>
<p>Dr Karl Marx

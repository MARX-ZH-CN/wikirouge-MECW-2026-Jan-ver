ENGELS TO PYOTR LAVROV</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Ramsgate, 15 August 1876<br>
11 Camden Square My dear Mr Lavrov,</p>
<p>On my return from Germany <i>l7s</i> I found awaiting me your letter of the 7th which I hastened to pass on to Liebknecht.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Since the people concerned are completely unknown to me, there was little else I could do.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>I hope our poor Smirnov will have strength enough to get over his illness. He has been working harder than the delicate state of his health allows, and he would be well-advised to take it a bit easier. With warmest regards both to him and to yourself.</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>F. Engels

On 6 August, Lavrov received a letter from one Dekhterev in Leipzig, who informed him, allegedly on behalf of the German Social-Democrats, that a certain Chernyshev had been despatched to Berlin to investigate this matter (see this volume, p. 147).</span>

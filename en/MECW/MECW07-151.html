<p>According to his statement he is working on a book on economics which he intends to publish and he proposes to live partly on the proceeds of his writings and partly the personal property of his wife,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>who, together with their three children,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>is still staying in Trier. The stamp attached to the application has been cancelled and is duly enclosed herewith.</p>

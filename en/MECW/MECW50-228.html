ENGELS TO FILIPPO TURATI</p>
<p>IN MILAN</p>
<p>[London,] 4 December 1894</p>
<p>41 Regent's Park Road</p>
<p>My dear Turati,</p>
<p>Where the deuce do you find the patience to keep writing to this dear <i>Monsieur E.?</i> But let's leave aside the bourgeois titles. As to your students, I regret infinitely that I am unable to come to their aid other than by giving them my best wishes. My time is so occupied that I cannot get down even to the most urgent matters at hand. The same day as I receive your card, one addresses the same request to me on behalf of Berlin students; I am obliged to send them the same refusal as I do to your friends. These little things are but trifles if taken separately, yet when all this happens day after day with a desperate regularity, it all adds up to a considerable loss of time. Be so kind as to make my excuses to your young friends to whom, nevertheless, I wish complete success.</p>
<p>I enclose my preface to the 3d volume of <i>Capital</i> for the benefit of citizeness Anna—there are several lines in which one might become interested in Italy.</p>
<p>It was good of you to cite Bebel in the <i>Critica Sociale.</i> Bebel has said bitter, but quite necessary truths. This was more opportune than the opportunism of his adversaries.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p>Please note the change of my address.

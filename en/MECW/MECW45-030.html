MARX TO MAX OPPENHEIM
<br>IN PRAGUE
<br>Karlsbad, 20 September 1874
<br>Dear Friend,
<br>My daughter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and I had been eagerly looking forward to spending a few days with you in Prague and we had made all our arrangements yesterday to make our way tomorrow (Monday) to the old Hussite city. Today, however, simultaneously with your kind letter, we received news from Hamburg which makes it imperative for me to choose the direct route via Leipzig in order to settle some business.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>However, all is not lost. I am almost certain to be coming back to Karlsbad next year and will incorporate the visit to Prague in my travel plans from the very start. Your sister<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> will already have written to you how very anxious I am, quite apart from the varied points of interest which Prague itself has to offer, to extend my personal acquaintance with yourself beyond the brief intermezzo here at the spa.
<br>Farewell and rest assured of my feelings of friendship towards you; my travelling companion sends her best regards.
<br>Yours,
<br>Karl Marx

On the way back to London, Marx stopped off in Dresden, Leipzig, Berlin and Hamburg. In Leipzig, where he stayed approximately from 25 to 28 September, he had talks about the state of the German working-class movement with Wilhelm Liebknecht and Wilhelm Bios, as well as with members of the Leipzig party branch. While in Hamburg on 29 September-1 October, Marx met Social-Democratic leaders.</span>

<p><b>122 Regents Park Road N.W.</b></p>
<p><b>London, June 14th, 1873</b></p>
<p><i><b>Citoyens,</b></i></p>
<p>I have to reply to your two letters of the 11th April and 14th May. As communicated before,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> the whole of the money for Lodi (fr. 200) was forwarded by me on April 10th to Bignami, new persecutions having arisen. The money was acknowledged by Bignami whose receipt I hold.— About 10 days ago, the <i>Plebe</i> has re-appeared and brought your address to the Spaniards and also, in a very prominent place, your declaration about the selfexclusion, from our Association, of the Secessionists.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The documents in question have been sent to the Spanish Federal Council.</p>
<p>My copy of the alterations of rules as prepared for the late General Council<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> has disappeared, I have however been promised another which shall be forwarded as soon as received.</p>
<p>As the <i>Plebe</i> is alive again I shall report about Italian Emigration and Gas strike etc. in my first correspondence to that paper. I could not act before, my only correspondent Bignami being out of the way and not having given me another address.</p>
<p>Le Moussu has been reminded of the stamps.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The £4.-3 are to hand and shall be used and directed as soon as a safe address in Paris can be found.</p>
<p>Fraternally yours,</p>
<p><i><b>F. Engels</b></i>

The address of the General Council of the International Working Men's Association to Spanish workers of February 23, 1873 was occasioned by the proclamation of a republic in Spain. It was published in La Plebe, No. 13, May 26, 1873.
After a temporary suspension from March 23, 1873, caused by police persecution, La Plebe resumed publication after May 15, 1873</span>

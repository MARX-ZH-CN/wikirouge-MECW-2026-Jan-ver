<p>Dear Frederick,</p>
<p>I am really worried by your silence. I hope you aren't ill. Conversely, I hope I haven't again given offence <i>malgré moi.</i> If, in my letter, acknowledging the £100, I discussed machinery, etc., this was really done to divert you, and distract you from your misery.</p>
<p>The Polish business and Prussia's intervention do indeed represent a combination that impels us to speak. Not in person, partly so as to avoid any appearance of competing with the student Blind, partly so as not to deny ourselves entry to Germany. But the Workers' Society here would serve well for the purpose. A manifesto should be issued in <i>its</i> name, and issued <b>immediately</b>. You must write the <i>military</i> bit — i.e. on Germany's military and political interest in the restoration of Poland. I shall write the diplomatic bit.</p>
<p>Well, <b>Old Boy</b>, let me have an answer and, if you've got anything on your mind, <b>speak out like a man</b> in the assurance that no one takes a warmer interest in your weal and woe than does</p>
<p>Your<br>Moor

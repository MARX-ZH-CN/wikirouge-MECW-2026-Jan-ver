To Engels in Manchester</p>
<p>[London,] 28 September 1853<br>
28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Herewith a letter from Weydemeyer, several from Cluss, a statement of Mr Willich's,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> a letter from Mazzini to Mrs Mott (abolitionist) in America.</p>
<p>I have split your essay into 2 and rewritten it as 2 essays<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> which I have sent to New York, my wife acting as secretary.</p>
<p>Pieper has had his throat cauterised in the German Hospital. A little board hangs at the foot of his bed bearing the ominous message: Wilhelm Pieper syphilis secundaris. He is subjected to rigorous discipline, which is salutary for him.</p>
<p>W. Wolff has written to his confidant, Rings. He is going to try his luck in Manchester until the end of October. If he hasn't found anything by then, he will move on. For the time being, he says, he is living at number such and such, Great Ducie Street,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> at 'another's expense'. He does not name you at all, which will give you an idea how obstinate and petty the OLD CHAP can be. After the way he grumbled about you he is, of course, ashamed to admit that he has any obligation towards you. Quant à nous autres<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> I don't know what he may have told Rings in his letter, since the latter says nothing about it.</p>
<p>I should like to clear up the matter with Mr Dronke,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> having now learnt that he sold Pieper's Ricardo, likewise a German history of political economy belonging to the working man, Lochner, etc., etc. Needless to say this has reinforced my STRONG SUSPICIONS about him.</p>
<p>Before he left, Mr Wolff gave Imandt also an account—and a very garbled one coloured by philistine indignation—of his insolent onslaught upon me.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> What annoys me is the excessive consideration I have always shown the old blusterer instead of baring my teeth at him.</p>
<p>Les choses marchent merveilleusement!<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> All h[ell] will be let loose in France when the financial bubble bursts.</p>
<p>In the Reform there is a melancholic, stylised article by Jacobi about the end of the world.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Don't let these lines fall into the wrong hands.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>Apropos. Yesterday I received a few lines from Blind. He will now have to reconcile himself to abandoning his democratic hauteur in the knife and fork question.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> He has lost his case and the whole of his wife's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> fortune has been temporarily sequestered. So there will be no more subsidies. I feel sorry for him, despite the absurd manner he thought fit to adopt.</p>
<p>Have you been following the story about Bakunin in The Morning Advertiser?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> Urquhart wrote an article in this connection<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> in which he suggests that Bakunin is suspect 1. because he's A RUSSIAN and 2. because he's 'A REVOLUTIONIST'; he goes on to assert that there are no honest revolutionaries among the Russians and that their would-be democratic writings (a swipe at Herzen and that polisson<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> Golovin) prove absolutely nothing; and finally, he tells the continental revolutionaries that, if they take Russians into their confidence, they are no less traitors than their governments.</p>
<p>The Russians, it would seem, then sent into the fray an Englishman (Richards), who nourishes a grudge against Urquhart, the latter having, on grounds of seniority, elbowed him out of the topic 'The Times and Turkey' in The Morning Advertiser. Richards maintains<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup> that to declare Bakunin a SPY is just as PREPOSTEROUS as TO IMPEACH PALMERSTON FOR BEING BRIBED BY RUSSIA; he invokes the testimony of both Ruge and myself,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup> praises Herzen's 'idées révolutionnaires',<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup> etc. Yesterday it was the turn of A. B., another minion of Urquhart's, who declared<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup> that he was acquainted with all the writings of 'la jeune Russie,'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" id="cite_ref-18">[18]</a></sup> and that they proved the Tightness of Urquhart's views, pan-slavism, etc.</p>
<p>At all events, les intrigants russes<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" id="cite_ref-19">[19]</a></sup> will realise that here it isn't as easy as in the pauvre<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" id="cite_ref-20">[20]</a></sup> French democracy, to give themselves airs, gain INFLUENCE and behave as though they were a kind of aristocracy within the revolutionary emigration. Here it supposes hard knocks. What service have the jackasses done Bakunin save to have him seriously accused in public while themselves receiving a slap in the face?

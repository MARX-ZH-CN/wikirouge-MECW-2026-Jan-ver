<blockquote>
<p>Engels wrote this letter on the advice of Nikolai Danielson who had informed him of the opportunity to have Marx's unpublished letter to the editors of the Otechestvenniye Zapiski printed in the magazine Severny Vestnik (see present edition, Vol. 24, pp. 196-201). However, Marx's letter did not appear in that magazine either and was first published in Russian in 1886 in Geneva in Vestnik Narodnoi Voli, No. 5 and in the Russian legal journal Yuridichesky Vestnik in October 1888.

<p>Jersey, August 25, 1885</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>Among the papers of my late friend Karl Marx I have found a reply to an article by Mr. Mikhailovsky: "Karl Marx Before the Tribunal of Mr. Zhukovsky". Since this reply, which was not published at the time for reasons unknown to me, may still be of interest to the Russian public, I am putting it at your disposal.</p>
<p>Yours, etc.

<br>TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN IN HANOVER
<br><br>
[London,] 30 December 1889
<br>Dear Kugelmann,
<br>A Happy New Year to you.
<br>Thank you for the prescription for my eyes, which, however, is not nearly concentrated enough for me. Last year and up till August I used cocaine and, as this grew less effective (on account of habituation), went on to ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, which works very well. If I weather the present short days successfully—the last daylight we saw was on 28 December—since yesterday morning it has been perpetual night—I shall have put the worst behind me.
<br>Kindest regards.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

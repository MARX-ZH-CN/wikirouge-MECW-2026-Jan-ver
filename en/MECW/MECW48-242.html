<p>TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN IN HANOVER</p>
<p><br>
[London,] 30 December 1889</p>
<p>Dear Kugelmann,</p>
<p>A Happy New Year to you.</p>
<p>Thank you for the prescription for my eyes, which, however, is not nearly concentrated enough for me. Last year and up till August I used cocaine and, as this grew less effective (on account of habituation), went on to ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, which works very well. If I weather the present short days successfully—the last daylight we saw was on 28 December—since yesterday morning it has been perpetual night—I shall have put the worst behind me.</p>
<p>Kindest regards.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

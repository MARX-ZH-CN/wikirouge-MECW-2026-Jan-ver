ENGELS TO JOHN LINCOLN MAHON<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London], 21 February 1889<br>
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Mahon,</p>
<p>I had a letter from Harney.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> He is still at Macclesfield (58 Bridge St.) suffering from his old complaint, rheumatic gout, so badly that he had to <i>dictate</i> his letter. He says in his present condition he is</p>
<p>'in no mood to meet people', and, 'as you see, little fitted to write however briefly. But do not think I can be of any service to Mr Atherley Jones in his laudable object and very proper filial duty, that of collecting his father's writings for re-issue'.</p>
<p>So I must leave you and Mr A. Jones to make the best of it, as far as Harney is concerned.</p>
<p>I <i>may</i> have a few odd numbers of <i>The People's Paper</i> but, if so, shall not be able to lay my hands on them until I find time for a re-arrange- ment of my collection of old papers, pamphlets, etc.</p>
<p>Faithfully yours,</p>
<p>F. Engels

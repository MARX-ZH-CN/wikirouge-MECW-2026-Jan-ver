MARX TO FRIEDRICH BOLTE</p>
<p>IN NEW YORK</p>
<p>Brighton, 25 August 1871</p>
<p>Dear Mr Bolte,</p>
<p>I have been here for about two weeks, sent by the doctor because my health was very much impaired as a result of overwork. I shall probably return to London next week, however.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Next week you will receive an Appeal by the General Council for the refugee Communards.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>Most of them are <i>in London</i> (over 80 to 90 by now). The General Council has kept them above water up to now, but in the past two weeks our funds have been melting away just like that, while the number of arrivals increases daily, so that they are in a very deplorable condition. I hope that everything possible will be done from New York. In Germany all the resources of the party are still absorbed by the victims of the police persecution there, as is the case in Austria, ditto Spain and Italy. In Switzerland they not only have a part of the refugees themselves to support, albeit a small part, but they also have to aid the members of the International as a result of the St Gallen LOCKOUT.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>Lastly, there are also some refugees in Belgium, though only a few and, what is more, the Belgians have to aid them, particularly in getting them through to London.</p>
<p>Owing to these circumstances, up to the present all the funds for the bulk of the refugees in London have been raised exclusively in England.</p>
<p>The <i>General Council</i> now includes the following members of the Commune: Serraillier, Vaillant, Theisz, Longuet and Frankel, and the <i>following agents of the Commune:</i> Delahaye, Rochat, Bastelica and Chalain.</p>
<p>I have sent <i>The New-York Herald</i> a statement in which I disclaim all responsibility for its correspondent's absurd and wholly distorted report of his conversation with me.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>I do not know whether it has printed the statement.</p>
<p>Give Sorge my regards. I shall answer his letter next week.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Faithfully yours,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

Eight hundred strikers who had resolved at their meeting to join the International were sacked. The support of the Swiss sections of the International enabled the strikers to hold out until September, secure reinstatement for the sacked workers, and win a reduction of the working day by one hour.</span>

ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester, 16 March 1858]</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>The letter with enclosure from New York<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>arrived here safely—when I sent off 'Beresford' last week I was in such a hurry that I completely forgot to acknowledge its receipt.</p>
<p>For the same reason I haven't yet been able to see Lupus and at this moment my head is again so full of damned COMMERCE that I can hardly summon what few wits I have, let alone work on Appleton's things. I shall finish 'Bomarsund' and if possible 'Bülow' in time for Friday, i. e. send off 'Bülow' tomorrow if possible, so that you'll have time to add the biographical part; the only sources I have, by the way, are Siborne and Jomini.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>For 'Bomarsund' I have to refer to the press again; there's nothing further about it in my papers.</p>
<p>Then I'll set to work with a will on 'Cavalry'. Unfortunately I can't lay my hand on anything about the Seven Years War,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>the heyday of the cavalry. However, <i>nous verrons.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>I'm annoyed at being unable to get through the things faster; but the second lot of B's was really a very tiring job and I quite definitely cannot work far into the night without suffering from insomnia for several days afterwards. Two evenings in succession is the maximum I can manage but, all the same, it's easier now than it was in the beginning.</p>
<p>Since Saturday, <i>nothing</i> whatever from Paris in the <i>Guardian.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

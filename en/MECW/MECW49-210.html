ENGELS TO JOHANN HEINRICH WILHELM DIETZ</p>
<p>IN STUTTGART</p>
<p>London, 12 May 1892</p>
<p>Dear Mr Dietz,</p>
<p>I am in complete agreement with your proposal of the 9th inst.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>I for my part concede you the right, in so far as it is within my competence, to print 10,000 copies, in return for which you are to pay me the following fees:</p>
<p>for 2,500 copies M. 500 in the autumn of 1892, after printing; " 2,500 " " 500 in the New Year of 1893; 5,000 " " 1,000 after printing this second half, but <i>not later than 6 months</i> after printing has <i>begun.</i></p>
<p>In view of your agreement with Wigand which is, after all, still very vague, I think you have chosen the right procedure. Whether you now stipulate <i>one</i> edition or decide to do several is your own affair. I of course am much more concerned with placing the work before the public again than with the kudos of having numerous editions.</p>
<p>With cordial regards,</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F. Engels

Dietz also informed Engels that he was going to print 10,000 copies and stated the terms concerning the fees, which Engels accepts in the present letter. Written on Dietz's letter in Engels' hand is the following note:<br>'Accepted.<br>'1/4 of the fee by autumn '92, after printing<br>'1/4 " " 1 Jan. 93<br>'1/2 " after printing the second 5,000, but not later than 6 months after<br>printing has begun.'</span>

MARX TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT
<br>IN BERLIN
<br>[London,] 24 June 1865
<br>Dear Liebknecht,
<br>You must explain to yourself my long silence by continuing indisposition and much work in intervals when I have been capable of it. Your letters, moreover, contained nothing which would have required urgent reply.
<br>T h e <i>Nordstern</i> has most likely been suspended for a while owing to lack of money? At least, it has not arrived here for a couple of weeks. A fine gutter rag, to be sure! T h e declaration by various associations<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> that anyone who so much as lays a finger on the articles of faith as revealed by Lassalle is guilty of high treason, is priceless. <i>Haut-goût</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> , INDEED! What is Mr B. Becker doing in Berlin, and how is the <i>Social-Demokrat</i> 'surviving'? You have quite the wrong notion of Dr Kugelmann. I have been in correspondence with him for years past. He was a socialist back in 1848, in Düsseldorf. As TO Pieper, the VERY NAME OF Kugelmann was not known to him when he was here.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <br>I have not yet written to Stumpf because I have not been writing any letters over this period. As regards the letter he entrusted to Bruhn, I have not, of course, ever set eyes upon it.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> <br>T h e INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION is making great strides <i>despite</i> the 'ENORMOUS SUPPORT' it is receiving from Germany. 2 2 0
<br>As regards the 'Louis Bonaparte',<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> I could see from your DROPPING OF THE SUBJECT that the matter has come to nothing. 7 9 I am RATHER glad of this, as I shall later be having it re-printed in the essay-collection all the same.
<br>What is old Hatzfeldt doing? A n d the fracas over the will?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> <br><i>Salut.</i>
<br>Your
<br>K. M.
<br>What are Messrs E. Bauer, Bucher <i>et</i> Co. up to? Edgar<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> will probably be staying here a while longer yet.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>

In the 1850s, while in exile in London, Pieper was a friend of Marx and Engels. From 1859 he lived in Bremen and late in February 1864 he visited Marx in London.</span>

<li id="cite_note-4"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-4">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Liebknecht's letter to Marx of 13 May 1865 contained a postscript from Paul Stumpf from Mainz who visited Berlin at the time. Stumpf wrote to Marx that he had sent him a letter ten days ago through Bruhn from Hamburg, in which he asked Marx for his opinion on the disagreements between the<i> Nordstern</i> and <i>Der Social-Demokrat,</i> on the situation in the General Association of German Workers and the position of its President, Bernhard Becker. Stumpf also asked Marx about his latest works and those of Engels and whether he had received the letter.</span>

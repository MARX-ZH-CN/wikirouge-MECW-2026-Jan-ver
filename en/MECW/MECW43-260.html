<p><b>Dear Fred</b>,</p>
<p>I send you 1 <i>Pionier,</i> 1 <i>Volksstaat,</i> and various copies of <i>Social-Demokrat.</i></p>
<p>You will see from the <i>Pionier</i> that Heinzen believes I only wrote <i>Capital</i> so that <i>he</i> should not understand it.</p>
<p>Schweitzer — utilising Liebknecht's anxiety with regard to his democratic friends — is behaving as though polemics against landed property were the first word in the Lassallean creed! <i>Quelle impudence!</i> Incidentally, Bonhorst did him good service in an issue of the <i>Volksstaat</i> that I cannot find. I don't know whether you receive the <i>Volksstaat.</i></p>
<p>Bonhorst's arrest is good.</p>
<p>There could be nothing more ridiculous than the respectable people's fear concerning the Queen's procession today. Everywhere overrun by police as in France. The whole alarm was produced by a <b>hoax</b>. A few agitators have had their fun in the past few weeks, circulating <b>handbills</b> calling on the starving workers of the East End to present themselves <i>en masse</i> to the Queen, and <i>de ne pas laisser passer la reine</i> [not let the Queen pass].</p>
<p>My family has just returned from the spectacle. Icy coldness amongst the public. Madame is said to have stared fuming-mad and ultra-crabby.</p>
<p>I shall send you, in the next few days, a volume I happened to pick up, which contains all sorts of pamphlets on Ireland. Those by Ensor (whom I also quoted in <i>Capital</i>) contain many piquant points. Ensor was a political economist of English origin (his father still lived in England when Ensor was born), Protestant and, despite all this, one of the most resolute <b>Repealers</b> before 1830. Being himself indifferent to religious things, he can defend Catholicism with wit against the Protestants. The first pamphlet in the book is by Arthur O'Connor. I had expected rather more of it, since this O'Connor played an important role in 1798, and I have found good articles by him about Castlereagh's administration in Cobbett's <i>Political Register. Tussy</i> should sometime look through Cobbett, for something there about Ireland.</p>
<p>This week Tussy and I lost 3 days putting my workroom in order. It had become jumbled to the frontiers of possibility.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.</p>
<p>Tussy <b>sends her best compliments to the family</b>.

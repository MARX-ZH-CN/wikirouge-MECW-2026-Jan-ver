ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY</p>
<p>IN STUTTGART</p>
<p>London, 24 December 1892</p>
<p>Dear Baron,</p>
<p>I have been trying to persuade August to cross the Channel this winter, if only for a few days, and am not without hope of his concurring. Should he do so, and since he will in any case have to travel via Stuckert,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I should be obliged if you could give him Marx's old Ms., together with such parts of the Ms. as you may have already completed. The rest we shall settle at some future date. For now that there is every prospect of Volume Ill's long gestation period at last drawing to its close, it's important that I should have the material for Volume IV at my disposal.</p>
<p>You shall have a more detailed reply to your letter shortly—in the meantime a Happy Christmas and cordial regards from</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. Engels

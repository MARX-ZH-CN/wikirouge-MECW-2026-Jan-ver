<br>After the two motions of Messrs. Beales and Leverson, mentioned in No. 30 of your newspaper, had been carried by the Polish meeting in London on March 1, <em>Mr. Peter Fox</em> (an Englishman), on behalf of the <em>International Working Men's Association</em>, proposed

<blockquote><br>"that an integral and independent Poland is an indispensable condition of democratic Europe, and that so long as this condition is unfulfilled, revolutionary triumphs on the Continent are short-lived [...] preludes to prolonged periods of counter-revolutionary rule."</blockquote>
<br>After briefly outlining the history of the evils which had befallen Europe as a result of the loss of liberty by Poland, and of Russia's policy of conquest, Mr. P. Fox said that the stand of the <em>Liberal</em> party on this question did not coincide with that of the <em>democratic</em> society for which he was speaking. The motto of conservative Europe was: an enslaved Europe with an enslaved Poland as a basis. The motto of the International Working Men's Association was, on the contrary: a free Europe based upon a free and independent Poland.
<br><em>Mr. Eccarius</em> (a German worker, Vice-President of the International Working Men's Association) seconded the motion, referring in detail to the share Prussia had taken in the various partitions of Poland. In conclusion he said:

<blockquote><br>"The downfall of the Prussian monarchy is the <em>conditio sine qua non</em> for the establishment of Germany and the re-establishment of Poland."</blockquote>
<br><em>Mr. Le Lubez</em>, a French member of the <em>International Working Men's Association</em>, likewise spoke in support of the motion, which was <em>carried unanimously, amid the continuous cheering of the meeting.</em>
<br><em>The Daily News</em> and a few other "liberal" London dailies <em>omitted</em> this part of the report, being vexed by the triumph of the <em>International Working Men's Association</em>, without whose collaboration, incidentally, the Polish meeting at St. Martin's Hall could not have taken place at all. On behalf of the International Working Men's Association, I request you to print this correction.
<br>London, etc.
<br>H. Jung,<br>Corresponding Secretary<br>of the International Working Men's Association for Switzerland

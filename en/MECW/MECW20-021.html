<p>After the two motions of Messrs. Beales and Leverson, mentioned in No. 30 of your newspaper, had been carried by the Polish meeting in London on March 1, <i>Mr. Peter Fox</i> (an Englishman), on behalf of the <i>International Working Men's Association</i>, proposed
</p>
<blockquote><p>"that an integral and independent Poland is an indispensable condition of democratic Europe, and that so long as this condition is unfulfilled, revolutionary triumphs on the Continent are short-lived [...] preludes to prolonged periods of counter-revolutionary rule."</p></blockquote>
<p>After briefly outlining the history of the evils which had befallen Europe as a result of the loss of liberty by Poland, and of Russia's policy of conquest, Mr. P. Fox said that the stand of the <i>Liberal</i> party on this question did not coincide with that of the <i>democratic</i> society for which he was speaking. The motto of conservative Europe was: an enslaved Europe with an enslaved Poland as a basis. The motto of the International Working Men's Association was, on the contrary: a free Europe based upon a free and independent Poland.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Eccarius</i> (a German worker, Vice-President of the International Working Men's Association) seconded the motion, referring in detail to the share Prussia had taken in the various partitions of Poland. In conclusion he said:
</p>
<blockquote><p>"The downfall of the Prussian monarchy is the <i>conditio sine qua non</i> for the establishment of Germany and the re-establishment of Poland."</p></blockquote>
<p><i>Mr. Le Lubez</i>, a French member of the <i>International Working Men's Association</i>, likewise spoke in support of the motion, which was <i>carried unanimously, amid the continuous cheering of the meeting.</i></p>
<p><i>The Daily News</i> and a few other "liberal" London dailies <i>omitted</i> this part of the report, being vexed by the triumph of the <i>International Working Men's Association</i>, without whose collaboration, incidentally, the Polish meeting at St. Martin's Hall could not have taken place at all. On behalf of the International Working Men's Association, I request you to print this correction.</p>
<p>London, etc.</p>
<p>H. Jung,<br>Corresponding Secretary<br>of the International Working Men's Association for Switzerland

<br>My dear Mr Engels,
<br>It's so long since we heard from you that Karl has an ardent desire for news of you. For a week now, he would <em>seem</em> to have been out of danger. The good, strong wine and enormous meals have enabled him to withstand the pain and the debilitating effect of the heavy discharge of pus. Unfortunately, he can't sleep at all and is still having very bad nights. The doctor is very satisfied with the way the complaint Is progressing and hopes that the suppuration will stop in 4 to 6 days. He is now getting up from time to time and today has been conveyed from the sickroom to the living-room.
<br>He sends you the enclosed circular from the Workers' Society as well as a letter from the 'Chair' — this little thing will divert the man 'who for 15 years has fought and suffered for the working class' [quoting speech by Lassalle] (presumably he means drinking champagne with the red-haired beauty b. 1805 [Sophie von Hatzfeldt]) from a course acceptable to the police to one that is unacceptable to the police. Write soon. With warm regards from us all.
<br>Yours,<br>Jenny Marx

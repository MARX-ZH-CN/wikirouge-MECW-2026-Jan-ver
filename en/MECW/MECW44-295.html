ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE
<br>IN HOBOKEN
<br>London, 3 May 1873
<br>Dear Sorge,
<br>Have received your letter of the 9th and that of the General Council of the 11th.
<br>1. Serraillier. What Dereure says is utter nonsense.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> The priest story amounts only to this: Pottier, a delegate of the Commune in the 2nd arrondissement, to which Serraillier was assigned, <i>hired out</i> the churches to the priests <i>(le dit délégué loue la boutique nommé Eglise, etc. etc. au nommé</i>... <i>pour y exercer le métier de cure</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> was the formula) and Pottier collected all the money and used it for Commune and arrondissement business and credited it to the Commune. Serraillier never had a sou of it in his hands. Le Moussu, who rises to the word 'priest' like a hungry fish to the bait, actually intended to have Pottier and Serraillier arrested for this, because, as he expressed it, <i>ceci était un commerce immoral</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <br>When it comes to bad jokes I am not sure who has produced the best one, Le Moussu or Pottier and Serraillier. But to base serious accusations on such childish grounds is worse than childish. However, the Frenchmen of today are children. What the demonstration of the 22 is supposed to be, I do not know; I suppose it was the attempted resignation of the minority. The row between majority and minority in the Commune is still going on and for everyone with a Blanquist taint it is still an offence even today, and a capital offence moreover, to have belonged to the minority. All this is ancient history for us here; we have heard every conceivable variation on that tune until we are sick of it and would not give a brass farthing for the entire story.
<br>2. <i>Arbeiter-Zeitung</i>—it must indeed be said that the uncouthness of its style could not be surpassed. However, that is American— the entire German-American press writes like that. For the present neither Marx nor myself have a single spare moment to write regular reports; I am up to my eyes in work for the Congress which is to be tabled in French<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> and Marx is immersed in his French translation.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> <br>3. The Viennese. We know no more than has appeared publicly, since neither Oberwinder nor Scheu has written to us direct.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> However, we have our suspicions about Scheu. 1. He is in touch with Vaillant and 2. there are signs that like his friend and predecessor, Neumayr, who has since gone mad, he is in contact with Bakunin. The echo of the latter's resounding phrases can be detected in Scheu's articles and speeches, and you will remember how his brother<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> disappeared from The Hague<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> as soon as the business with Bakunin came to a head. Up to now no serious allegations against Oberwinder have been made, at least in public. His collaboration on bourgeois papers took place with the foreknowledge and approval of the party and directly served party purposes. If <i>The Times</i> were put at my disposal tomorrow and I could write what I wanted and receive payment for it, I would accept without hesitation. Nobody objected to Eccarius doing this until he reversed the situation and exploited the International in his own financial interests and no longer wrote in its interests but in his own and those of <i>The Times.</i> And since in Austria feudalism has only partly been overcome, the masses are still incredibly stupid and conditions are still about the same as those in Germany before 1848, we naturally do not take it amiss that Oberwinder does not immediately demand the moon with the maximum of radical hullaballoo, but instead pursues the policies we advocated at the end of the <i>Communist Manifesto</i> as being appropriate for Germany at the time. Here and there he may exhibit an excess of petty-bourgeois caution, but in the first place even that has not been proved and in the second, it is no cause for such a tremendous hue and cry. Moreover, Oberwinder is no Austrian and so could be deported at any time. But, as I have said, we do not know the details and so reserve our judgment.
<br>4. Admission requirements.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> —Even assuming that formally you are in the right to make all these demands on the individual sections (which is, however, very much open to doubt), up to now <i>no</i> Federal Council has ever imposed these bureaucratically precise conditions, and had it imposed them, they would <i>never</i> have been fulfilled. What a great mistake it was to make such requirements even in <i>France</i> is demonstrated by the article in No. 49 of the <i>Neuer Social-Demokrat,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> which I am sending you today. I informed Hepner<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> straightaway and, having made precise enquiries yesterday about Dentraygues and Heddeghem, I have despatched the necessary statement to the <i>Volksstaat</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> 5. We expect more news about France before taking any steps. I do not see that there are any steps you could possibly take. <i>All</i> our sections have been uncovered. Heddeghem <i>was</i> a spy as early as The Hague. Dentraygues is not, but for personal reasons and from weakness, he denounced some individuals who had previously beaten him up. A member who wanted to obtain some money for the party had given his watch to Dentraygues, asking him to pawn it. Dentraygues' wife did so and later refused to redeem it or even to hand over the pawn-ticket. This caused a scandal. A few people—mainly bourgeois—got together, gave Dentraygues a thrashing and then denounced him to the public prosecutor, at whose urgings <i>they confessed that the money had been intended for the use of the International!</i>!! This was the <i>real</i> beginning of the whole business—but since Heddeghem had already informed the police in Paris of all this, it could come as a surprise only to the Toulouse police at most. These then are the fellows that Dentraygues denounced, and there was <i>no one else.</i> How the police found out about other things you will see from the <i>Volksstaat.</i> At all events, at the present time the organisation in France is in pieces and will take some time to recover since all communications have broken down. Larroque is in Spain, in San Sebastian. His address: Monsieur Latraque, Calle de la Aduana, No. 21—he is living there under that name. For goodness' sake do not send any new letters of authority to France. Larroque has been given 3 years <i>in contumaciam</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> <br>6. Stamps.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup> —I hardly ever see Le Moussu, I have got Marx to give him a good kick, but still no answer. It is impossible to do any business with these Frenchmen without wasting whole weeks at a time chasing after them, and I cannot do that.
<br>7. Venue for the Congress. 672—I hope you have only asked the Swiss for their advice as we did with the Dutch last year. In Switzerland there is only <i>one possible place</i> and that is <i>Geneva.</i> There we have the mass of workers behind us, and also <i>a hall belonging to the International,</i> the Temple Unique, from which we can simply throw the gentlemen from the Alliance<sup>10</sup> out when they present themselves. Apart from Geneva, only Zurich would be possible; but there we have hardly more than the few <i>German</i> workers and not even all of these (vide the <i>Felleisen)</i> and your enquiry might even result in the proposal from various sides that the Congress should be held at the centrally situated town of Olten—the chief railway junction in Switzerland, in which case we should really be in the soup. The Alliancists are doing everything in their power to turn up at the Congress in force, whereas on our side everyone is going to sleep. No French delegates can come since the collapse. The Germans, although they have their own quarrel with the Lassalleans, were very disheartened by the Hague Congress, where they expected nothing but fraternity and harmony in contrast to their own squabbles, and have become apathetic. Moreover, the party authorities of the Social-Democratic Workers' Party consist at the moment of nothing but dyed-in-the-wool Lassalleans (Yorck &amp; Co.) who are insisting that both the Party and its paper should be forced into the straitjacket of a Lassalleanism of the most superficial sort. The struggle continues; the Lassalleans wish to take advantage of the time in which Liebknecht and Bebel are in gaol<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup> so as to get their own way. Little Hepner is putting up vigorous resistance, but he has been as good as forced off the board of the <i>Volksstaat</i> and anyway has been deported from Leipzig.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup> The victory of these fellows would be synonymous with the loss of the Party for us—for the moment at least. I have written Liebknecht a very determined letter to this effect<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup> and am still awaiting a reply.—From Denmark nothing has been seen or heard. My long-held suspicion that the Lassalleans of the <i>Neuer Social-Demokrat</i> have thrown everything into confusion there through their supporters in North Schleswig and have induced people to withdraw from the International,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" id="cite_ref-18">[18]</a></sup> is daily confirmed by the <i>Neuer Social-Demokrat,</i> which is much better informed about events in Copenhagen than the <i>Volksstaat.</i>—From England only a few delegates can come and it is very doubtful whether the Spaniards will send one, so it is to be expected that the Congress will be very poorly attended and that the Bakuninists will have more people there than us. The Genevans themselves are doing nothing, the <i>Égalité</i> seems to be defunct, so that even there no great support appears likely—merely the consciousness that there we shall <i>be sitting in our own house</i> and among people who know Bakunin and his gang and can throw them out if need be. So Geneva is the <i>only</i> place possible, and to secure a victory for us, the only necessary condition remaining—<i>though it is an absolutely indispensable one</i>—is that, in accordance with the resolution of 26 January,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" id="cite_ref-19">[19]</a></sup> the General Council should now announce the following <i>resignations:</i>
<br>1. The <i>Belgian</i> Federation, which has declared that it has nothing to do with the General Council and which has repudiated the Hague resolutions.
<br>2. That part of the <i>Spanish</i> Federation which was represented in Cordoba<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20" id="cite_ref-20">[20]</a></sup> and which contravened the Rules by declaring the payment of dues to the General Council to be optional, and which has also repudiated the Hague resolutions.
<br>3. The <i>English</i> sections and individuals represented at the would-be London congress of 26 January, who have likewise repudiated the Hague resolutions.<sup>852</sup>
<br>4. The Jura Federation which, at the congress they are due to hold shortly,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21" id="cite_ref-21">[21]</a></sup> will undoubtedly give us adequate grounds to extend the resolution on suspension.
<br>Lastly, it could be announced that the so-called Italian Federation which was represented at the so-called congress of Bologna<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22" id="cite_ref-22">[22]</a></sup> (instead of Mirandola), is not a member of the International at all since it has never satisfied even a single one of the conditions laid down by the Rules.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23" id="cite_ref-23">[23]</a></sup> <br>Once this resolution has been published and the General Council has set up a committee in Geneva to make preparations for the Congress and to scrutinise the mandates <i>in advance,</i> a committee consisting e.g. of Becker,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24" id="cite_ref-24">[24]</a></sup> Perret, Duval and Utin, if he is there, the mass surge forward of the Bakuninists will have been forestalled. As soon as the General Council has issued instructions to the committees that these people cannot be given recognition as delegates until they have been granted admission by the majority of the genuine and acknowledged delegates of the International, all will be well. Even if they were in the majority, they would be innocuous; they could go elsewhere and hold their own congress, but without having brought their majority to bear vis-à-vis ourselves. And that is all we can ask for.
<br>Cordial regards from Marx too.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

It stipulated that the French edition was to be published in 44 instalments, and sold five instalments at a time.<br>The French authorised edition of Volume I of <i>Capital</i> was published between 17 September 1872 and November 1875.

The report was read out by Engels at the Hague Congress sitting of 7 September 1872, and unanimously approved.<br>Marx and Engels arrived at The Hague to take part in the Congress on 1 September 1872.

Its decision to include in the General Rules (as Article 7a) the major tenet on the conquest of political power by the proletariat, and its resolutions relating to Administrative Regulations signified a victory for Marxism. The Congress took stock of the struggle Marx, Engels and their followers had waged for years against petty-bourgeois sectarianism in the workers' movement, in whatever guise it appeared, most notably against Bakuninism; Mikhail Bakunin and James Guillaume, the anarchist leaders, were expelled from the International. The resolutions of the Hague Congress laid the groundwork for the future formation of independent political parties of the working class on a national level.</br></br></span>

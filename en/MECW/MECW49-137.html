ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE</p>
<p>AT LE PERREUX</p>
<p>London, 13 October 1891</p>
<p>My dear Laura,</p>
<p>Herewith the cheque £20 — to turn your landlady out of your domicile.</p>
<p>Now as to your <i>Almanack.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>I am writing you an article but as it will have a practical turn toward the end of it, I can hardly send it off, or give it its final shape, until a short time before publication. Therefore I <i>must</i> know when your <i>Almanach</i> is to appear. Otherwise the thing may turn stale, or even be completely upset by events. It won't be more than 2 or 3 pages, 4 at outside, so there will be no necessity to send it early — as far as <i>technical</i> matters are in question. But you will see that it is impossible to write <i>un article d'actualité</i> unless it be printed and published at once. So please let me know and I shall gladly do my best to oblige <i>nos amis de là-bas.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thanks for the papers. That <i>Action de Lyon</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>seems a splendid specimen of the present state of fusion and confusion amongst the French socialists, out of the midst of which arises, erect, unavoidable, <i>zudringlich, unausstehlich</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>the everlasting Adrien Veber, basking in his own conceit, in which he is hardly second to his worthy master Benoît Malon.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>How does this new harmony of all the disharmonies work? I see in the <i>Secrétariat du travail</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>there are all sorts, Possibilists A and B, aside of our people and a lot of others, and so far they seem to have respected each other's carcasses without coming to blows. I cannot imagine how it is done and what may be the upshot of it.</p>
<p>How much was the fine inflicted on Paul? I cannot find it in the <i>Socialiste</i> and have not any other paper ready at hand — and what chances have you to evade it?</p>
<p>Love from Louise, Pumps, the children and your old ever thirsty (going to have a bear with Pumps)</p>
<p>F. Engels

Veber praised it beyond measure, calling the author 'the most significant mind of modern socialism'.</span>

<li id="cite_note-6"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-6">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The <i>Secrétariat du travail</i> was set up in France in early October 1891 in conformity with the decision of the Brussels International Socialist Workers' Congress (see Note 135) decreeing the establishment of such bodies in every country. The secretariats were to study the workers' living and working conditions, gather and publicise data on these matters, mediate in industrial disputes, etc.
The French Secretariat of Labour, composed of representatives of conflicting groups and parties, failed to produce positive results and was disbanded in 1896.</span>

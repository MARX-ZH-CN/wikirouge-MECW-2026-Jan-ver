<p><em>Cologne, October 22</em>. Following the reprint by the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> No. 292 of an article from the <em>Mannheimer Abendzeitung</em> from Pfalz, October 12", which begins with the words:</p>
<p>"I was really surprised when I found yesterday that the <em>Augsburg Allgmeine Zeitung</em> had printed an article (on communism), taken from Aachen news-sheets, which truly did not deserve to be accepted by a newspaper which otherwise has such good material", the <em>Aachener Zeitung</em> No. 293 has published a reply, extracts from which we certainly do not want to withhold from our- readers, in view of a special wish expressed by the editorial board of this newspaper, and all the more since it affords us the opportunity we desire for a subsequent correction. The <em>Aachener Zeitung</em> rightly believes that the <em>Rheinische</em>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"could have known that the <em>Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung</em> had torn out only a few passages from its article on the Communists (in No. 277 of the <em>Aachener Zeitung</em>) and added comments of its own, which of course gave a different complexion to the article".
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As stated, the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> was not only aware of this, but knew also that the <em>Aachener Zeitung</em> was quite innocent in regard to those fragments, insipidly and cunningly put together by the Augsburg newspaper No. 284, which were aimed solely at the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em>. Therefore, in settling accounts with the Augsburg newspaper in No. 289, the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> very properly did not draw the <em>Aachener Zeitung</em> into the debate. But if someone from Pfalz could be misled into a false assumption by the heading in spaced type of that Augsburg newspaper's article: "<em>We Read Aachen News-sheets</em>", that is at any rate an indication that the <em>Aachener Zeitung</em> could have anticipated earlier such a misunderstanding in respect of the <em>Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung</em>. Having once undertaken to deal wholly on its own account with the Augsburg article, the <em>Rheinische Zeitung</em> could very well allow the incidental reprint of the -note in the <em>Mannheimer Abendzeitung</em> to pass without any guide-mark since, of course, its readers already knew where that came from. The following passage from today's article in the <em>Aachener Zeitung</em> requires no further comment:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It knows that we are not against any free research, that we shall not weaken the efforts of those who are concerned for the welfare of any class of people. We are liberal towards all, which is more than the majority of liberals of many varieties can so far say about themselves. What we said, however, is that communism cannot find any soil among us, but that, on the other hand, it is a natural phenomenon in France and England. We added, lastly, that we were not ourselves opposed to communist efforts in Germany, but were very definitely against any club-like brotherhoods of the kind that are said to have sprung up in Silesia. Liberal ideas are not yet so firmly rooted among us, and have not yet made such progress among us, that every endeavour does not need to be carefully fostered. As a rule, however, we see in our country far too little harmony between newspapers of the same colour. They do not bear in mind that an isolated undertaking cannot cover the whole field, and that a total effect can be produced only by each in turn becoming the bearer and disseminator of the ideas of the other.

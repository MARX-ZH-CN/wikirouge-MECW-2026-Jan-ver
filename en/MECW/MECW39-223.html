ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>Manchester, 1 May 1854
<br>Dear Marx,
<br>The business of Heise is really rather disastrous. If the chap had behaved dubiously in regard to <i>party matters</i>, you might at least have let me know. <i>As it was</i>, I could only suppose that, for a new convert, he was PERFECTLY SAFE. I hadn't met him before, except for a couple of days in the Palatinate; seeing him in London as part of the intimate circle and, like Meyer, apparently a special favourite of yours, I naturally concluded that the fellow had already done penance down there, had undergone his <i>épreuves</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and earned your good graces. Hitherto I have treated him accordingly and, since he had nothing to do and is in other ways a cheerful sort of chap, I've been going round with him more than with anyone else. Moreover, now that the philistines have got to know that I'm living with Mary<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and this has got to stop, I have taken lodgings NEXT DOOR TO HIM, though I haven't yet moved in. Well, all this is exceedingly difficult to set right now, and I can see only one way of doing it: from your letter I can only conclude that you gave him a letter for me. <i>This I have not received</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Write to me at once so that I can question him about it.
<br>There were two reasons why I did the Schimmelpfennig article with him<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> : 1. because I wanted the fellow to be given a dressing-down without <i>myself</i> appearing to be working for the <i>Reform</i>, 2. because it was absolutely essential that Heise be given something to do to get him out of his indolent ways. The article is very good and, though marred here and there by Heise's style, gives Mr Schimmelpfennig some rough treatment. The thing can be of no further benefit to Heise, for he'll never be able to write another article of the kind; on the other hand, the business greatly impressed him by showing him how surely and on what a firm 'basis' we operate. However, even this wouldn't have happened had I been informed, and at least the fellow wouldn't have cost me so much; as it is, I have him round my neck and, <i>au bout du compte</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> am more or less responsible for his household debts, etc., etc.
<br>As regards my visit to London, it seems very questionable. I have far too much to do at the office to be able to get away easily. However, if all had gone well with <i>The Daily News</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> I had indeed intended to come down and clinch the thing by word of mouth. That reason no longer obtains and, since the thing would cost me some £7-£8, which I can ill afford and I could only stay down there 3-4 days at the most, I shan't come if I can help it.
<br>After Cluss' letter, returned herewith, I shall now send him the article on Schimmelpfennig to be used as circumstances dictate; if he has already become too involved with Schimmelpfennig,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> it will at least serve to enlighten Cluss privately concerning Schimmelpfennig and at the same time help him not to become too deeply involved. As a soldier, give me Willich any day, rather than that clever-clever Schimmelpfennig who really has nothing to him except sheer vanity and arrogance, and whose entire stock of learning derives from a few common or garden manuals and textbooks.
<br>I shall let you have another article on Turkey, military or otherwise, for next Friday's STEAMER. It is time we harked back to our first articles on the subject,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> including the political aspect. Here, too, we have been splendidly vindicated by circumstances; the pertinacity of the Greek insurrection<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> and the evident uneasiness of the Turks in Bulgaria prove, <i>après tout</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> that the Christian population is starting to bestir itself and that the Turkish Empire is rapidly approaching its end. On the other hand it is symptomatic of the Turks' great weakness that the larger part of their army, as was always its wont, ran away home during the winter and that as yet no amount of reform has succeeded in instilling in these fellows a soldierly spirit on the European pattern. As regards the Odessa business we shall have to have some more detailed news; up till now everything has been too contradictory. Lupus is fuming at the allies for not having cut the Russians to pieces <i>ad majorem gloriam Aberdeeni et Bonaparti</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> He and Heise now vie with each other in dismaying the philistines with flat contradictions and downright rudeness. One or both of them will get a beating before long; yesterday they came close to it, whereupon I suddenly began talking in a Lancashire accent, which made the philistines laugh and provided the opportunity for a dignified retreat.
<br>Heise, by the way, won't ever be dangerous, his writing ability is far inferior to little Dronke's, idleness is his speciality. No knowledge whatever, only a strong inclination to acquire the ABC of everything. With great difficulty he succeeded in learning the ABC of Russian, but has already forgotten it again.
<br><i>Sûr ce que Dieu l'ait en sa sainte garde, habeat sibi!</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> <br>Your
<br>F. E.

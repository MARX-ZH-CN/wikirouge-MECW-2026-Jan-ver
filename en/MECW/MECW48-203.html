ENGELS TO PASQUALE MARTIGNETTI
<br>IN BENEVENTO
<br>London, 9 July 1889
<br>Dear Friend,
<br>When I read your letter of 7 June I could only conclude that you might, perhaps, no longer be at liberty by the time my answer arrived. Rather than allow my letter to fall into the wrong hands and in the end cause you further harm, I preferred not to write at all. Your letter of the 6th inst.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> has reassured me on that score.
<br>The harsh blow that fate has, I'm sure, quite <i>undeservedly</i> dealt you has aroused my most heartfelt sympathy. You must allow me, at this moment when the whole of your life lies in ruins, to send you a further small loan in the shape of the enclosed money order for five pounds sterling.
<br>As things are <i>now,</i> I certainly believe that your family is right about Buenos Aires and that you ought to put this plan into operation at once.
<br>But circumstances being what they are at present, the slightest, albeit involuntary, indiscretion on my part might prove harmful to you. The post is not to be relied on anywhere, so I would prefer to say nothing more until we can again correspond in complete safety.
<br>With my sincere sympathy
<br>Yours ever,<br>
RE.

Martignetti said he would leave for Buenos Aires if the sentence was endorsed (see note 230).</span>

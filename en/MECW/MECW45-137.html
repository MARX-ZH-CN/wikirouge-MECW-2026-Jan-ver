MARX TO FREDERIC HARRISON</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 21 January 1877<br>
41 Maitland Park Crescent, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>The bearer of this letter, my nephew, Mr Henry Juta of Cape Town, wants to complete his general studies at the London University, and, at the same time, to become a member of the Inner Temple.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> For the latter purpose he has to sign a paper stating that he is no attorney etc. and his own signature has to be</p>
<p>countersigned by two barristers attesting that he is a proper person etc. As the affair is very pressing, I have taken the liberty to direct him to you in the hope that you will be so kind as to instruct the young man how to find his way out of this difficulty. I have the honour, Sir, to be</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>Karl Marx</p>
<p>Fd. Harrison, Esq.

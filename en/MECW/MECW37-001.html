<p>Volume 37 of the Collected Works of Marx and Engels contains Volume III of Capital, and Preface and Supplement to Capital, Volume Three, by Engels.</p>
<p>Volume III deals with the process of capitalist production as a whole.</p>
<p>The present English edition follows the first German edition of 1894 edited by Engels. Errors and misprints found in the first German edition have been corrected. Figures and other data have been checked and set right where necessary. Quotations from different sources have been ascertained; those from English and American authors were checked with the original publications and given according to the 1894 German edition. Quotations in French, Latin and Greek are given in English translation. Bibliographical footnotes are based on Marx's excerpts and preparatory material.</p>
<p>The author's footnotes are marked by superior numbers with a round bracket, as distinct from editors' notes marked merely by numbers and footnotes indicated by index letters. Engels' insertions and footnotes are, as a rule, marked by his initials and placed into double oblique lines.</p>
<p>Foreign words and expressions are italicised and retained in the form used in the original with translation in the footnote where necessary. English words and expressions used by Marx and Engels are set in small caps, longer passages are placed in asterisks.</p>
<p>The volume was compiled and the preface, notes and indexes written by Tatyana Andrushchenko and Izora Kazmina; Mikhail Ternovsky took part in editing the volume (Russian Independent Institute of Social and National Problems).</p>
<p>The present English edition is based on the 1958 publication of Capital by the Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow, in which extensive use was made of the English translation by Ernest Untermann printed by Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co., Chicago, 1909.</p>
<p>The volume was prepared for the press by Yelena Chistyakova, Margarita Lopukhina and Maria Shcheglova (Progress Publishing Group Corporation).

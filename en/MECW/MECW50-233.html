ENGELS TO PYOTR LAVROV</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>London, 18 December 1894
<i>41 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</i></p>
<p>My dear Lavrov,</p>
<p>Mme Lafargue has sent me your letter, and I hasten to assure you that I have not at all forgotten about you. But</p>
<p>1) <i>Dühring,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> 3rd edition—I had only 6 copies, which I sent to no one except Mme Lafargue and Mme Aveling. The rest have been taken, as always happens. I have found one more copy which I will send to you immediately.</p>
<p>2) <i>Capital,</i> 3rd volume. If it is on sale in Paris and elsewhere, this is because the editor has displayed exemplary avarice towards me. There were copies in <i>Rome</i> before I had received a single one! However, I am expecting another delivery in a few days, and then I will be able to send you the copy long since intended for you.</p>
<p>I hope you are keeping well—as for me, I cannot complain, but I am beginning to realise that 74 is not 47. However, events should help us to maintain our vital forces, the whole of Europe is warming up, crises are brewing everywhere, particularly in Russia. The situation cannot last much longer over there. So much the better.</p>
<p>Yours</p>
<p>F. Engels</p>

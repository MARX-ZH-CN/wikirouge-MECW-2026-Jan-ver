MARX TO KARL KAUTSKY</p>
<p>IN ZURICH</p>
<p>[London,] 1 October 1881<br>
<i>In great haste</i></p>
<p>Dear Mr Kautsky,</p>
<p>I enclose a line to your mother<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>together with the enclosed note for my daughter.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>21° It would have saved time if you had sent me your mother's Paris address.</p>
<p>I would have asked your mother to spend a few days at my house and at the same time take a look round London with me. <i>My wife's fatal illness,</i> which day by day <i>is drawing closer to its consummation,</i> prevented this. I am her <i>garde malade</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I get the <i>Arbeiterstimme</i> regularly; it edifies but does not surprise me, for I've known my Swiss for decades.</p>
<p>With regard to Mr McGuire, it would appear from your letter that he is in London. How comes it that none of our New York friends gave him letters of recommendation? I have, <i>prima facie</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>, always been somewhat suspicious of YANKEE socialists and know in particular that the kind that Shipton keeps in touch with are very crotchety and sectarian. With all that, Mr McGuire may be an excellent party man.</p>
<p>My wife and daughter send you their compliments.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

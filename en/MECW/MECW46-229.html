MARX TO ELEANOR MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Postcard, unsigned]</p>
<p>[Ventnor, 23 December 1882]</p>
<p>Dear Child,</p>
<p>From Laura's letter (which Engels sent me for information today<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>) I see that Jennychen is again afflicted by that beastly inflamma- tion.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>Should it be neglected, I can only fear the worst. We must really consider (and you should talk this over with Lenchen before coming to join me here) whether we ought not to relieve Jennychen at any rate of Harry, even if it should necessitate his coming here. How can Jennychen find time for the treatment of her illness WITH ALL THESE BABIES TOGETHER? And again, how neglected (as regards health) our Johnny will be should one of the others not be displaced in his stead?</p>
<p>Harry makes a difficult position doubly difficult<br>
for poor Jennychen.</p>
<p>All I want you to bring is <i>Physiologie</i> by <i>Rank</i> (or <i>Ranke</i>—I'm not sure). Also <i>Freeman's</i> rotten <i>little book (History of Europe),</i> since it</p>
<p>serves me in lieu of a chronological table; it is in my bedroom on the shelves where the newspapers, etc., are.</p>
<p>[On the side reserved for the address]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this poem Engels expressed his attitude to the weekly <i>Der Bremer Stadbote</i>, to which for fun he had sent several months in succession his poems (including <i>To the</i> Enemies, see this volume, p. 5) under the signature of Theodor Hildebrand, passing himself off as its supporter. This poem is also quoted, with minor stylistic changes, in Engels' letter to Wilhelm Graeber written about April 28-30, 1839. (Note from MECW vol. 2, 1975)

<p>Dear <i>Bremen Courier</i>,</p>
<p><br>
Please don't be offended</p>
<p>If you've become the laughing-stock of town.</p>
<p>Remember, friend, that folk have always tended</p>
<p>To ridicule what's patently unsound.</p>
<p>Your sunshine days have very nearly ended</p>
<p>In the three months that you've been trotting round.</p>
<p>Have you been saying things you didn't ought,</p>
<p>To give yourself such food for afterthoughts</p>
<p><br>
My poems cost little effort when I did them;</p>
<p>The donkey work was almost wholly done.</p>
<p>I took your articles and parodied them;</p>
<p>The subject-matter came from you alone.</p>
<p>Simply subtract the rhyme-schemes and the rhythm —</p>
<p>The image that remains is all your own.</p>
<p>Rage, if you like, at your respectful and</p>
<p>Obedient servant,</p>
<p><br>
<i>Theodor Hildebrand</i>

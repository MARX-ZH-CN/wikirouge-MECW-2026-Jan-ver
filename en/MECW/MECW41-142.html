<p>TO CARL SIEBEL IN ELBEREELD</p>
<p><br>
London, 3 January 1861</p>
<p>9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park,</p>
<p>Haverstock Hill</p>
<p><br>
Dear Siebel,</p>
<p>HAPPY NEW YEAR! To you and your BETTER HALF. I must acknowledge with many thanks the arrival of my library,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> ditto of your letter.</p>
<p>Of the 6 COPIES of <i><a href="MECW17-011.html">Herr Vogt</a></i> you ordered, will you kindly send one to the <i>Kölner Anzeiger</i>, one to the <i>Zeitung für Norddeutschland</i> (Hanover), 3 to any literary journals you please. The main thing is that you yourself should read through a copy and yourself do a notice of it.</p>
<p>As for the <i>Kölner Anzeiger</i>, you might use this little sheet as a weapon against the <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i>.</p>
<p>Sales of the book are going so well that Petsch is 'contemplating' a second edition. In such an event, it would be of the utmost importance that you should, if possible, supply me with <i>everything</i> that appears about it in Germany (I see nothing here but the <i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i>, the <i>Neue Preussische Zeitung</i>, and the <i>Volks-Zeitung</i>), and keep me <i>au courant</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ed. Meyen has already vented a heartrending 'cry of pain' in the <i>Freischütz</i>.'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <i>Vivat sequens</i>!'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Next time, you might try and find time to write to me at somewhat greater length.</p>
<p>I have been very unfortunate of late. My wife was dangerously ill for 5 weeks and I had to lodge the 3 children elsewhere.</p>
<p>As regards Schily, we'll knock some sense into him again.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i>.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. Marx

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">This refers to Marx's private library which he had collected in the 1840s and left in the safekeeping of his friend, Communist League member Roland Daniels, in Cologne in May 1849, when expelled by the Prussian authorities. Shortly before being arrested in 1851, Daniels hid the books in the warehouse of his brother, a wine merchant. Acquitted at the Cologne Communist trial in late 1852, he came out of prison a gravely sick man. He died of tuberculosis in August 1855. At the beginning of 1856 Daniels' widow took steps to send the books to Marx, but owing to the high transportation costs and other problems, it was not until December 1860 that he received his library, with some books missing.
A list of the books of this library, compiled by Daniels and with notes by Marx, has been preserved.</span>

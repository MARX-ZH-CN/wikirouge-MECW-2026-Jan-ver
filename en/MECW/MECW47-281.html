ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Eastbourne, 25 August 1886<br>
4 Cavendish Place</p>
<p>Dear Baron,</p>
<p>Your letter sent to Offenbach will arrive in plenty of time, as Liebknecht doesn't leave Borsdorf until the evening of the 26th, i. e. will be in Offenbach on the 27th and won't leave Cologne until 1.40 p. m. on the 29th, assuming he is travelling via Flushing as he previously said he would.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>So I shall be arriving in London on Sunday evening<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> between 9 and 10 and hope to see you both that same night. I have asked Liebknecht to take a cab straight to my house, so what more could he want?</p>
<p>You would greatly oblige me if you would call round on Friday evening to see whether any letters have arrived for me, in particular one from the <i>Union Bank of London,</i> and if so send them on, as I want to attend to one or two business matters on Saturday if possible.</p>
<p>Kindest regards.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F.E.

Eleanor Marx-Aveling and Edward Aveling made a trip around the United States at approximately the same time (see Note 601). Liebknecht stayed in Eastbourne with Engels for four days, left Liverpool on 4 September and arrived in New York on 13 September where he met the Avelings. In New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Detroit, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Washington and other cities he gave talks and lectures on the theory and history of socialism, the state of the workers' movement in Europe and other subjects. This trip, which he completed on 26 November, raised 16,000 marks for the German Social Democrats' election fund. On his way back to Germany, Liebknecht stayed with Engels in London from 5 to 10 December, following which he set off on his way home to Borsdorf near Leipzig.</span>

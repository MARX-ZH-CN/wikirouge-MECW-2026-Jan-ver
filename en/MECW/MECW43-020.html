MARX TO ENGELS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>IN MANCHESTER
<br>[London,] 16 May 1868
<br>DEAR FRED,
<br>My silence for a week has perhaps already been explained to you by Schorlemmer.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Two carbuncles on the scrotum would perhaps have made even Sulla peevish. How greatly that man, despite his more-than-Palmerstonian TEMPER, was affected by his mythical but anyway lousy sickness, is shown by the fact that just 10 days before his death he had the decurion seized in a neighbouring city, and 1 day before he himself croaked had him strangled in his own house.<sup>07</sup>
<br>In addition, I have all sorts of trouble. For example, on the 28th of this month a bill for £15 due at the butcher's, etc. To my urgent petitions to Holland no answer.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <br>Finally I had cajoled myself with the illusion that by this time I would have a 2nd edition,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> and thus see money for the first. But I had added up the bill without the host—I do not mean the Volkswirt,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> but the Germans in general.
<br>POOR Siebel! In a way he had himself prepared his premature death. But WITH ALL THAT he was a good fellow. We are unlucky— Daniels, Wolff, Schramm, Weydemeyer, Siebel, Weerth! Not to speak of the living dead.
<br>As regards <i>The Fortnightly Review,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> I had long considered this point, and had long arranged with Lafargue (the actual negotiator with Beesly) that you should appear under any old <i>nom de guerre,</i> which you must let us know. Beesly himself will not be informed who the man is. And it is all the same to him. Apart from other considerations, the impact in Germany would be greatly lessened if the stuff appeared under your name.
<br>In your last letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> you made a mistake on one point. The notes used on p. 186<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> you yourself wrote late one evening in my notebook, which still exists.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> The notes of the Russian Ermen,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> on the other hand, referred mainly to technical things.
<br>Incidentally, the main thing for me was to ascertain the magnitude of the <i>advanced</i> circulating capital, i.e. advanced in raw material, etc., and wages, as against the circulating capital <i>turned over.</i> I have enough STATEMENTS, part of them from manufacturers, handed in either to the COMMISSIONERS c or to private economists. But everywhere only the annual accounts. The devil of the thing is that there is a wide divergence in political economy between what is of practical interest and what is theoretically necessary, so that one cannot even find the necessary material, as in other sciences.
<br>I have received cuttings from Berlin newspapers from Eichhoff and sent him cuttings from here in RETURN. We have also exchanged two letters.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> But now the enclosed shows, what Borkheim half guessed on his last visit to Berlin, that Eichhoff has let himself into concessions <i>quoad</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> Stieber. Probably from sheer stupidity. For this reason he has taken up political economy as a neutral field.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> For the rest, it appears that he feels uneasy, and he told Borkheim that, after swotting up properly on economy, he will exchange Berlin for Vienna, i.\ ABOUT 6 MONTHS
<br>In the <i>Essener Zeitung</i> a pompous denunciation of the International Working Men's Association.
<br>Did you read the warlike SPEECH by Failly when taking over the command of Chalons? I have once again worked through the finances of the Empire. And only one thing appears clear to me, that Badinguet<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup> <i>must</i> make war.
<br><i>Salut.</i>
<br>Your
<br>K. M.

While working on the review, Engels wrote out excerpts from<i> Capital,</i> which later made up a synopsis (see Note 26).

However, as early as May, Liebknecht informed Borkheim that Eichhoff had promised to let him have the necessary anti-Stieber materials. The content of Liebknecht's letters was known to Marx. His associates began to distrust Eichhoff even more after he had been seen in the company of Berlin police officers, and especially after his speech at the inaugural meeting of the Democratic Workers' Society, which appeared in<i> Die Zukunft</i> newspaper in distorted form and was later reprinted by the<i> Demokratisches Wochenblatt, </i> No. 43, 24 October 1868 (see this volume, pp. 151, 153). Marx had done a great deal to clear Eichhoff's name. On Marx's request, Eichhoff wrote to him on 31 October-1 November giving full explanations which convinced Marx of his dedication to the cause of revolution (see also Marx's letter TO ENGELS of 16 April 1869).</span>

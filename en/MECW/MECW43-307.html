MARX TO WILHELM BRACKE<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN BRUNSWICK</p>
<p>[London, 24 March 1870]</p>
<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>Yesterday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>I send you 3,000 CARDS OF MEMBERSHIP addressed to <i>von Bonhorst</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>I have information for you, which is not uninteresting, about the internal affairs of the Internationals. This will reach you by an indirect route.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>In accordance with the Rules, all national committees in contact with the General Council must send it three-monthly reports on the situation of the movement. When I remind you of this, I would ask you to consider that this report is <i>not</i> written for the public, and should, therefore, present the facts completely factually, without make-up.</p>
<p>From Borkheim and from the latest letter from Bonhorst I know that the finances of the Eisenachers are in a bad state.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>As a consolation, the information that the finances of the General Council are below zero, steadily growing <i>negative</i> dimensions.

In a Committee letter of 17 March 1870, Wilhelm Bracke noted that Johann Georg Eccarius had long been commissioned with obtaining 3,000 International membership cards which could have been distributed in the Party. On receiving the letter, Marx immediately forwarded the requested membership cards to Leonhard von Bonhorst as the Committee Secretary.</span>

MARX TO ENGELS
<br>IN MANCHESTER
<br>London, 28 September [1859]
<br>Dear Engels,
<br>Yesterday evening I had a visit from Lessner, whom I had sent for in connection with the Manchester subscribers to the <i>Volk.</i>
<br>Like Biskamp, he assures me that (apart from Lupus) there wasn't a single direct subscriber to the <i>Volk.</i> And up till now no one has sent a FARTHING to London.
<br>After the <i>Volk</i> ceased publication Thimm wrote to Lessner asking for an account. Lessner replied that he could send him an account only in respect of the period in which he, Lessner, had been despatch clerk. He then sent him an invoice for the <i>individual numbers.</i> Up till yesterday there had been no reply from Thimm.
<br>So I'd like to know what fellows are kicking up the fuss in Manchester and on what PRETEXT.
<br>Down here we (and I especially) have unpleasantnesses enough in respect of the <i>Volk</i> without that.
<br>The 'Particulars' about Kossuth in <i>The Free Press</i> are mine.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> (I have made 2 articles out of them for the <i>Tribune</i> and shall see whether they are accepted.) I got them from Szemere, partly in writing, partly by word of mouth. Szemere was here a few weeks ago.
<br><i>Salut.</i> Regards to Lupus.
<br>Your
<br>K. M.
<br>It's doubtful whether Biskamp will pull through. The poor devil is as low as can be. We seem to attract every damned spot of bother that's going.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">On 23 August 1859 the<i> New-York Daily Tribune</i> published an anonymous item marked 'From Our Own Correspondent' (written by the Hungarian emigrant Ferenc Pulszky) which was an attempt to justify Kossuth's ties with Napoleon III. Early in September Marx sent two articles to the paper exposing the ties of both Kossuth and his followers, including Pulszky, with Bonapartist circles. The facts testifying to Kossuth's dealings with Napoleon III, which Marx cited in the two articles were given to him by Bertalan Szemere on 1 September 1859 when the latter visited him in London. The<i> Tribune</i> published, on 24 September, one article by Marx on the subject, 'Kossuth and Louis Napoleon' (present edition, Vol. 16), possibly combining the two he had sent. Whether Marx's private letter to the<i> Tribune</i> editor, Charles Dana, was used in it is not known, for the letter has not been found. On 28 September the London<i> Free Press</i> published Marx's article 'Particulars of Kossuth's Transaction with Louis Napoleon', which was a condensed version of the<i> Tribune</i> article.—494, 497, 507, 525</span>

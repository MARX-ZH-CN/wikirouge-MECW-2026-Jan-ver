ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT</p>
<p>IN LEIPZIG</p>
<p>[London, 1 August 1890]</p>
<p>Dear Liebknecht,</p>
<p>Unfortunately I shan't be able to remain here until 15 August — we are probably going to the seaside at the end of next week; I shall write and let you know where as soon as this has been settled to the satisfaction of all concerned. Your statement has appeared in <i>The People's Press</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> but it won't put a stop to the sniping in <i>Justice.</i><sup>2</sup> Those chaps are incorrigible; they want to force you people and myself to knuckle under to them and the Possibilists,<sup>3</sup> but in that case they have a long wait ahead of them. They now possess an ally in the great Gilles — congratulations!</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

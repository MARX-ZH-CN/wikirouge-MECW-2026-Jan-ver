<p>Dear Doctor,</p>
<p>Enclosed please find an article ["Alexander Jung, <i>Lectures on Modern German literature</i>."] for the [<i>Deutsche</i>] <i>Jahrbücher</i>. I have put the Dante thing to one side for the time being. I would have sent it sooner if I had had anything like enough time.</p>
<p>I got your letter after it had gone to a number of wrong addresses. Why didn't I send <i>Schelling und die Offenbarung</i> to the <i>Jahrbücher</i>? 1) Because what I had in mind was a book of between 5 and 6 folios and this was cut down to 3 1/2 folios only in the course of my negotiations with the publishers. 2) Because up to then the <i>Jahrbücher</i> had been a little reserved about Schelling. 3) Because people here advised against attacking Schelling in a journal and told me rather to put out a pamphlet against him. <i>Schelling, der Philosoph in Christo</i> is also from my pen.</p>
<p>Apart from all this, I am not a Doctor and cannot ever become one. I am only a merchant and a Royal Prussian artillerist, so kindly spare me that title.</p>
<p>I hope to send you another manuscript very soon and in the meantime I remain</p>
<p>Yours sincerely, <i>F. Engels (Oswald)</i></p>
<p>Berlin, June 15, 42 Dorotheenstr. 56

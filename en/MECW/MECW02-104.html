<br>Dear Doctor,
<br>Enclosed please find an article ["Alexander Jung, <em>Lectures on Modern German literature</em>."] for the [<em>Deutsche</em>] <em>Jahrbücher</em>. I have put the Dante thing to one side for the time being. I would have sent it sooner if I had had anything like enough time.
<br>I got your letter after it had gone to a number of wrong addresses. Why didn't I send <em>Schelling und die Offenbarung</em> to the <em>Jahrbücher</em>? 1) Because what I had in mind was a book of between 5 and 6 folios and this was cut down to 3 1/2 folios only in the course of my negotiations with the publishers. 2) Because up to then the <em>Jahrbücher</em> had been a little reserved about Schelling. 3) Because people here advised against attacking Schelling in a journal and told me rather to put out a pamphlet against him. <em>Schelling, der Philosoph in Christo</em> is also from my pen.
<br>Apart from all this, I am not a Doctor and cannot ever become one. I am only a merchant and a Royal Prussian artillerist, so kindly spare me that title.
<br>I hope to send you another manuscript very soon and in the meantime I remain
<br>Yours sincerely, <em>F. Engels (Oswald)</em>
<br>Berlin, June 15, 42 Dorotheenstr. 56

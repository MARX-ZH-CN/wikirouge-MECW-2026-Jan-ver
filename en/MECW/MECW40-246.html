<p><i>To Max Friedländer in Vienna</i>
</p>
<h4 class="mw-headline" id="ME40-246-2">London, 16 May 1859 9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, Haverstock Hill</h4><a id="London,_16_May_1859_9_Grafton_Terrace,_Maitland_Park,_Haverstock_Hill"></a>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I have been receiving the Vienna <i>Presse</i> regularly and my debt to you for sending it is the greater in that it throws light on conditions in Austria at this important juncture.</p>
<p>I have not yet had a reply to the letter I wrote you some weeks ago. If, by chance, the proposed arrangement [Marx writing for the <i>Presse</i>] has come to nothing as a result of the <b>derangement</b> of the Vienna money market, I <i>would beg you to advise me of this by return</i> for I have made certain agreements regarding telegrams with newspapers over here which commit me to financial outlays and which I shall accordingly terminate forthwith.</p>
<p>Yours very truly,<br>Dr K. Marx
</p>

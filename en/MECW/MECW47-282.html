ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY
<br>IN LONDON
<br>Eastbourne, 26 August 1886
<br>Dear Kautsky,
<br>Liebknecht is arriving on Monday<sup>a</sup> at a station to be specified by you — via Flushing; if he hasn't got your letter, then at <i>Holborn.</i> So he has no need of advice. If he finds no one at the station, he will take a CAB to my house.
<br>I shall be arriving in London on Saturday afternoon or, at the latest, evening<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> — I hope if possible to get to Regent's Park Road by 4 or 5. Harney will probably visit me on Sunday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> More when we meet. Should there be a letter for me from the UNION BANK on Friday and you could send it on <i>before</i> 5.30, I should be most grateful; otherwise it can wait until I arrive, just as all the rest can wait; there is time enough.
<br>Kindest regards to your wife.
<br>Your
<br>F.E.

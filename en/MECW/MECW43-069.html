<p><i>To Sigfrid Meyer in New York</i>
</p>
<h4 class="mw-headline" id="ME43-69-2">London, 14 September 1868 1 Modena Villas, Maitland Park, Haverstock Hill</h4><a id="London,_14_September_1868_1_Modena_Villas,_Maitland_Park,_Haverstock_Hill"></a>
<p>Dear Meyer,</p>
<p>Enclosed the issue of <i>The Times</i> containing the 4th <b>Annual Report</b> of the <b>General Council</b> (written by <i>me</i>)<i>,</i> and the very interesting <i>Times</i> <b>first leader</b> on this document. This is the first time that it has abandoned its tone of <i>moquerie</i> about the working class, and taken it 'verry' <i>au sérieux.</i> Spread this around. Inform Jessup of this.</p>
<p>I must reply to both your letters, the first to me and the 2nd to Eccarius, which was handed me in his absence (he has not yet returned from Brussels).</p>
<p>As far as the first letter is concerned, it is your fault if <i>Sorge</i> (who is <i>completely unknown</i> to me) has received credentials. If you wanted simply to give him a recommendation for a particular purpose, you should have written so clearly. The way you put it in your letter, I believed that Sorge was <i>your and A. Vogt's man</i>. So be more careful in future. Then you made the second mistake of <i>giving</i> the credentials to Sorge, instead of writing to me first about the misunderstanding!</p>
<p>The mistake has been made, but it is not irreparable.</p>
<p>The Brussels Congress has once again allotted the General Council to London. But it is now to be regarded as a <i>new</i> <b>Council</b>, which <i>revises</i> all <i>old</i> credentials. So write to me whether you and A. Vogt want credentials. Write, too, <i>in which manner</i> we should withdraw Sorge's credentials or, alternatively, inform him that the new General Council has changed the credentials.</p>
<p>Drury was here for a while. Recently, shortly before the Brussels Congress, he was <i>proposed</i> as authorised agent of the <b>International Workingmen's Association</b> to the <b>American Labor Union</b> and its congress. We <i>did not agree to this at the time,</i> since the source of the suggestion appeared suspicious to us. Please observe the man more closely first, either yourself or through friends.</p>
<p>No <b>copies</b> remain of the <i>Commonwealth</i> <b>paper</b>. For the past few years there have <i>not</i> been any <i>agitational</i> writings in our sense in England. My <i>book has not yet been translated into English.</i> Eccarius, otherwise very capable, but at the same time very <b>ambitious</b>, has <i>intentionally not mentioned it</i> in <i>The Commonwealth</i> or at other opportunities. He likes to appropriate my propositions <i>for himself.</i> At the congress in Brussels, Lessner mentioned <i>my book</i> in his speech about machinery. The correspondent of <i>The Daily News</i> reported this. Eccarius, who reported the congress sessions for <i>The Times</i>, suppressed it. His conduct is all the more absurd since he owes me not only his knowledge, but also his post as general secretary on the <b>General Council</b>. I alone supported him (at <i>The Commonwealth</i> too) against attacks by the English and French. He relies upon the experience he already has with me, that I am only concerned with the cause, and ignore personal stupidities!</p>
<p>I shall <i>not</i> give him your letter.</p>
<p>The more English excerpts from my book you can get into the American press the better.</p>
<p>Send them to me!</p>
<p>I attach the enclosed card. It was sent to us, with a letter, to establish contact with us. Address: G. W. Randall, <b>Secretary, Workingmen's Institute</b>, 3 Tremont Row, Room 52, <i>Boston</i> N. E.</p>
<p>I lost contact years ago with all my acquaintances in America. I am still in touch only with Meyer in St. Louis, the friend of our J. Weydemeyer (deceased last year).</p>
<p>Write me all you can find out about the relationship between the railways and real estate.</p>
<p>You may have seen that, at its congress in Hamburg, the General Association of German Workers passed a special resolution giving recognition to my book.</p>
<p>Write to Randall on my behalf as <b>German Secretary</b> of the <b>General Council</b>.</p>
<p>Best greetings to A. Vogt and yourself.</p>
<p>Yours<br>K. Marx</p>
<p>I am sending 2 copies of <i>The Times,</i> one for you, the other for Jessup.

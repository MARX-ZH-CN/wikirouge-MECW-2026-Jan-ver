<br>Dear Meyer,
<br>Enclosed the issue of <em>The Times</em> containing the 4th <b>Annual Report</b> of the <b>General Council</b> (written by <em>me</em>)<em>,</em> and the very interesting <em>Times</em> <b>first leader</b> on this document. This is the first time that it has abandoned its tone of <em>moquerie</em> about the working class, and taken it 'verry' <em>au sérieux.</em> Spread this around. Inform Jessup of this.
<br>I must reply to both your letters, the first to me and the 2nd to Eccarius, which was handed me in his absence (he has not yet returned from Brussels).
<br>As far as the first letter is concerned, it is your fault if <em>Sorge</em> (who is <em>completely unknown</em> to me) has received credentials. If you wanted simply to give him a recommendation for a particular purpose, you should have written so clearly. The way you put it in your letter, I believed that Sorge was <em>your and A. Vogt's man</em>. So be more careful in future. Then you made the second mistake of <em>giving</em> the credentials to Sorge, instead of writing to me first about the misunderstanding!
<br>The mistake has been made, but it is not irreparable.
<br>The Brussels Congress has once again allotted the General Council to London. But it is now to be regarded as a <em>new</em> <b>Council</b>, which <em>revises</em> all <em>old</em> credentials. So write to me whether you and A. Vogt want credentials. Write, too, <em>in which manner</em> we should withdraw Sorge's credentials or, alternatively, inform him that the new General Council has changed the credentials.
<br>Drury was here for a while. Recently, shortly before the Brussels Congress, he was <em>proposed</em> as authorised agent of the <b>International Workingmen's Association</b> to the <b>American Labor Union</b> and its congress. We <em>did not agree to this at the time,</em> since the source of the suggestion appeared suspicious to us. Please observe the man more closely first, either yourself or through friends.
<br>No <b>copies</b> remain of the <em>Commonwealth</em> <b>paper</b>. For the past few years there have <em>not</em> been any <em>agitational</em> writings in our sense in England. My <em>book has not yet been translated into English.</em> Eccarius, otherwise very capable, but at the same time very <b>ambitious</b>, has <em>intentionally not mentioned it</em> in <em>The Commonwealth</em> or at other opportunities. He likes to appropriate my propositions <em>for himself.</em> At the congress in Brussels, Lessner mentioned <em>my book</em> in his speech about machinery. The correspondent of <em>The Daily News</em> reported this. Eccarius, who reported the congress sessions for <em>The Times</em>, suppressed it. His conduct is all the more absurd since he owes me not only his knowledge, but also his post as general secretary on the <b>General Council</b>. I alone supported him (at <em>The Commonwealth</em> too) against attacks by the English and French. He relies upon the experience he already has with me, that I am only concerned with the cause, and ignore personal stupidities!
<br>I shall <em>not</em> give him your letter.
<br>The more English excerpts from my book you can get into the American press the better.
<br>Send them to me!
<br>I attach the enclosed card. It was sent to us, with a letter, to establish contact with us. Address: G. W. Randall, <b>Secretary, Workingmen's Institute</b>, 3 Tremont Row, Room 52, <em>Boston</em> N. E.
<br>I lost contact years ago with all my acquaintances in America. I am still in touch only with Meyer in St. Louis, the friend of our J. Weydemeyer (deceased last year).
<br>Write me all you can find out about the relationship between the railways and real estate.
<br>You may have seen that, at its congress in Hamburg, the General Association of German Workers passed a special resolution giving recognition to my book.
<br>Write to Randall on my behalf as <b>German Secretary</b> of the <b>General Council</b>.
<br>Best greetings to A. Vogt and yourself.
<br>Yours<br>K. Marx
<br>I am sending 2 copies of <em>The Times,</em> one for you, the other for Jessup.

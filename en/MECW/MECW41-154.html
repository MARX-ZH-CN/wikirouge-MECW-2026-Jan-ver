MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>London, 2 February 1861</p>
<p>Dear Frederick,</p>
<p>Yesterday I got the enclosed note from Freiligrath<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> which doesn't make matters any more agreeable. You must write and tell me at once what I ought to do.</p>
<p>In fact, I've been so BOTHERED from all sides that my head is going round and round and, on top of that, there is the unpleasantness of having to annoy you with all my <i>petites misères.</i></p>
<p>I have written to Dana, who is definitely in the WRONG <i>legally,</i> but with little prospect of success.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> The fellows know that one needs them and that they, for their part, don't need one at this moment.</p>
<p>Weren't you going to send me the <i>Nazione</i>—certain letters of Mazzini's? Forgotten? You will shortly be getting the confiscated issue of the <i>Courrier du Dimanche</i> from me.</p>
<p>Bucher maintains—he asked Borkheim to tell me—that his review will still appear in the <i>Allgemeine Zeitung.</i> You will doubtless have seen that at every opportunity the scoundrelly Blind brings his name before the public as an <i>homme d'état.</i></p>
<p>The rotten book business has cost me more than <i>£4</i> all in all. What a strange fate this LIBRARY has!<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>No news from Siebel? His connections certainly seem to be exceedingly limited.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p><i>Thimm</i> told Petsch a day or two ago that <i>Herr Vogt</i> has been the object of some particularly malicious abuse in Manchester. Brass, expressly for his own personal satisfaction, has ordered new type to be cast so that <i>Herr Vogt</i> can be advertised in an even more conspicuous manner. Given the large number of Swiss in Manchester, is it not possible to sell at least 1 COPY of the <i>Grenzpost</i> there?

Shortly before being arrested in 1851, Daniels hid the books in the warehouse of his brother, a wine merchant. Acquitted at the Cologne Communist trial in late 1852, he came out of prison a gravely sick man. He died of tuberculosis in August 1855. At the beginning of 1856 Daniels' widow took steps to send the books to Marx, but owing to the high transportation costs and other problems, it was not until December 1860 that he received his library, with some books missing.<br>A list of the books of this library, compiled by Daniels and with notes by Marx, has been preserved.</span>

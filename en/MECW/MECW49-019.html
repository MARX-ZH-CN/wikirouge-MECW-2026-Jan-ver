<br>ENGELS TO JAKINS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>IN LONDON
<br>[Draft]
<br>[London, 23 September 1890]
<br>In pursuance of the conversation I had with you, I now beg to say that I am willing to take the house 122 Regent's Park Road on a three years agreement (similar to the one I previously had with the late Marquis de Rothwell) and at the rent of £60 a year on the condition that the landlord does for me what he would be required to do for a new tenant.
<br>Besides smaller repairs, such as papering, etc., which might be necessary by next spring, there are two points which in my opinion come under that class, viz.
<br>1) a new efficient kitchen range to replace the present one which is 20 years old and quite worn out;
<br>2) efficient arrangements for a hot and cold water bath, the present bath having only cold water to turn on.
<br>I hope these demands will not be found unreasonable and remain
<br>Dear Sir
<br>etc.

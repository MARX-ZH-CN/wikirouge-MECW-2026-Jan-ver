<p>Dear Kugelmann</p>
<p>Best thanks for your letter. The children are getting on well, although they are not yet well enough to go out (today is the ninth day).</p>
<p>As for my book, I received five copies of the <i>Elberfelder-Zeitung </i>yesterday, containing a very benevolent review by Dr Schnake<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>(I know the name from 1848, but do not know him personally). There is a good deal of confusion in his presentation of the matter. On the other hand, I am informed from Berlin that clown Faucher makes merry over my book in the June number of his journal.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>It is good that the gentlemen at last give vent to their annoyance.</p>
<p>I do not yet know if and when I am coming to Germany. I am at last free of carbuncles.</p>
<p>Engels is certainly going over in August or September.</p>
<p>Salut! And my compliments to Mrs Kugelmann and the little one.</p>
<p>Yours</p>
<p>K Marx

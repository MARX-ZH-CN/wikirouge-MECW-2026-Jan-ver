MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 12 April 1860</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>BEST THANKS for the hundred pound note. It came as a glorious surprise THIS MORNING. The whole family was filled with glee.</p>
<p>You may or may not have seen that the <i>Kölnische Zeitung (Schlesinger,</i> London) has had the impudence to talk about the Brimstone Gang<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>and its Russian redolence. WELL! Through the good offices of my bankrupt friend Speck I am now hot on the trail of the whole Brimstone Gang here in London.</p>
<p><i>D'abord,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>you'll have seen in the papers that Palmerston has amused himself by presenting Mr <i>Reuter</i> (the Jew from Trieste of telegraph fame) to the Queen.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>And who do you think is factotum to this grammatically illiterate Jew Reuter? — <i>Siegmund Engländer,</i> who was expelled from Paris because, although a spy in the pay of France (600 frs. per month), he was discovered to be a 'secret' Russian spy. This same Reuter, together with Engländer, Hörfei and Schlesinger, was a partner in a Bonapartist lithographic news agency in Paris (an <i>honorary member</i> being one Esterhazy, a MAN ABOUT TOWN and the cousin of Esterh., the Austrian ambassador); they fell out, etc. Mr <i>Bernhard Wolff, chief proprietor of the Berlin 'National-Zeitung'</i> and owner of the Berlin telegraphic bureau, is hand-in-purse (partners) with <i>S. Engländer,</i> who is at present editing European world history in Reuter's name. N. B. Russia has now joined the 'Austro-German Telegraphic Union' and, <i>pour encourager les autres,</i> has got Pam to present her Reuter to the QUEEN. I am to get a detailed account of Schlesingers entire <i>curriculum vitae,</i> as well as that of Reuter's.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>My thanks to Siebel for the notes, which arrived today. Also for his <i>Religion und Liebe.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>My wife thinks highly of the latter.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The original <i>Brimstone Gang</i> (Schwefelbande) was a students' association in Jena University in the 1770s whose members were notorious for their brawls. Later the expression Brimstone Gang came to be applied to any group of ill repute. In Geneva in 1849-50 it was also the jocular name for a small company of German refugees, inoffensive and happy-go-lucky idlers. In his pamphlet <i>Mein Prozess gegen die Allgemeine Zeitung,</i> Vogt included Marx and his party associates in the 'Brimstone Gang', although they had nothing to do with it (for details see this volume, pp. 70-71 and Marx's <i>Herr Vogt,</i> present edition, Vol. 17, pp. 28-37).</span>

To Jenny Marx in London</p>
<p>[Manchester,] Thursday evening [18 December 1851]</p>
<p>Dear Mrs Marx,</p>
<p>I have received both your letters<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and hasten to write and tell you that it goes without saying that each of us will send off his article separately, as there is otherwise every prospect of none of them catching the steamer. In London the letters should be at the post office by 5 or 6 o'clock on Friday evening. I shall see what I can do—for some time now the fatherland has bored me so dreadfully that I know nothing about anything. Anyway I shall send off something. The English <i>Manifesto</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> together with such New York <i>Schnellposts</i> as are still available here, I shall be bringing with me. Tell Marx to be sure not to forget to write to Weydemeyer, asking him to obtain the relevant numbers of the <i>Tribune</i> immediately from Dana and send them on to me here so that I may proceed.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>When I shall be able to leave—maybe not until Saturday morning—I don't yet know exactly.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> But I think I shall arrive at the latest at 6 o'clock on Saturday evening, perhaps as early as 11 in the morning. Until then, my warm regards to you and all your family from your</p>
<p>F. Engels

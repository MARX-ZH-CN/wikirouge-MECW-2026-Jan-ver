ENGELS TO HERMANN ENGELS</p>
<p>IN BARMEN</p>
<p>London, 20 March 1895<br>
41 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Hermann,</p>
<p>Many thanks for the kind wedding invitation which I am unfortunately unable to accept. Apart from other obstacles, I have again fallen prey to the springtime complaint which, for the past four or five years, has regularly crippled me for some weeks at this season. A little rest will no doubt suffice to put paid to the thing, thus enabling me, a week tomorrow, to drink a glass of the best to Elsbeth<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and her bridegroom's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> health, as will be conscientiously done.</p>
<p>Otherwise I am well and have grown more or less accustomed to the domestic and dietary regulations befitting an elderly gentleman—so much so, in fact, that any deviation therefrom becomes instantly apparent to me from all manner of little upsets and I get given the well-meant but earnest advice to desist from the same in future. I had never imagined that pedantry could again be imposed upon me as a rule of life and a moral duty.</p>
<p>Well, I hope that, even in my absence, you will all have a very happy day, and wish Elsbeth the best of luck in her new status as a married woman; also offspring more distinguished by their health than by their numbers.</p>
<p>Much love to Emma<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> and all the children,</p>
<p>Your old</p>
<p>Friedrich

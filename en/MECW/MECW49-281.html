AVELING TO LAURA LAFARGUE</p>
<p>AT LE FERREUX</p>
<p>[London,] 22 April 1892</p>
<p>My dear Laura,</p>
<p>Enclosed a reply from the sweat Adolphe<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>to Paul's very excellent letter. I am writing to you from the General's, as I wished to ask his opinion before writing to you on the matter. He agrees with me that some answer should go, if you can induce Paul to send it. I know, of course, he is busy, but you may be sure that a reply <i>is</i> necessary here. It need not be long.</p>
<p>But <i>who</i> sends Lavy? Is it the <i>Broussists,</i> or is it, as Smith 463 writes, the <i>joint Committee?</i> That makes all the difference. But a few facts as to the real strength of the Parti Ouvrier would have a good effect here, and anyhow I hope the elections of May 1st<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>will show our real strength.</p>
<p>Get Paul to write, or rather, as I said before, do <i>you</i> write. (We all recognised your 'Roman hand' in the <i>Chronicle</i> article.)</p>
<p>Just time to catch the post. Love from the General and Louise and</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Tussy

In 26 towns the socialists obtained more seats than any other party and in Roubaix, Marseille, Narbonne and Toulon they headed the municipal councils.</span>

TO MARX IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, Tuesday, 15 April [1851]</p>
<p>Dear Marx,</p>
<p>Herewith POST OFFICE ORDER for £5.</p>
<p>If your wife's state of health and your other circumstances permit, come up the day after tomorrow, Thursday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>There are three trains for you to choose from: 1. at half past six in the morning, arriving here at 2 o'clock (has 2nd class); 2. the PARLIAMENTARY TRAIN<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>at seven in the morning (2nd and 3rd class), arriving at half past six in the evening; 3. at 12 o'clock midday, arriving at 9 in the evening (2nd class). Then, from Friday to Monday we could make a tour of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Anyway, write and tell me by return whether you're coming and by which train; I shall then be at the station. If you can't come up on Thursday, although <i>sous beaucoup de rapports</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>that would be preferable, then come up on Friday. At any rate, let me know at once how and when.</p>
<p>All else I'll leave for verbal discussion, since I'd better go and get the POST OFFICE ORDER straight away. My regards to your wife and children.</p>
<p>Your
F. E.</p>
<p>Once again the Post Office was too crowded—enclosed half a five-pound note—the other half by the next post.

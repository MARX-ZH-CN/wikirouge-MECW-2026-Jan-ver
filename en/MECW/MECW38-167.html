TO MARX IN LONDON
<br>Manchester, Tuesday, 15 April [1851]
<br>Dear Marx,
<br>Herewith POST OFFICE ORDER for £5.
<br>If your wife's state of health and your other circumstances permit, come up the day after tomorrow, Thursday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> There are three trains for you to choose from: 1. at half past six in the morning, arriving here at 2 o'clock (has 2nd class); 2. the PARLIAMENTARY TRAIN<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> at seven in the morning (2nd and 3rd class), arriving at half past six in the evening; 3. at 12 o'clock midday, arriving at 9 in the evening (2nd class). Then, from Friday to Monday we could make a tour of the neighbourhood.
<br>Anyway, write and tell me by return whether you're coming and by which train; I shall then be at the station. If you can't come up on Thursday, although <i>sous beaucoup de rapports</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> that would be preferable, then come up on Friday. At any rate, let me know at once how and when.
<br>All else I'll leave for verbal discussion, since I'd better go and get the POST OFFICE ORDER straight away. My regards to your wife and children.
<br>Your
F. E.
<br>Once again the Post Office was too crowded—enclosed half a five-pound note—the other half by the next post.

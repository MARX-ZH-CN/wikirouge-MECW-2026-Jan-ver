MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 5 June 1856</p>
<p>28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Frederic,</p>
<p>I leave for Scotland at the end of this week, and shall come on to you from there after an interval of 6 days, but will of course give you prior notice. Should you write to me during this week, address the letters 'C. Marx, CARE OF P. Imandt, 29 Cowgate, Dundee'. There was a twofold reason for my decision to come to you <i>via</i> Scotland:</p>
<p>1. <i>Medical,</i> because I know that the sea-voyage will put me to rights and it was only the day before yesterday that I got rid of my rheumatism. Moreover, there have been other unpleasantnesses, including excessive bleeding at stool. I have, of course, also consulted my SURGEON.</p>
<p>2. <i>Pieper.</i> He will accompany me to Scotland and then return to London. Had I not agreed to this arrangement, the lad—he obtained the money for the trip from his former pupil, A. Rothschild—was fully determined to make his way to Paris on a false passport, allegedly with the intention of proceeding from there to Geneva on foot. You will realise what a strange and compromising end SUCH AN EXPEDITION LIKELY WAS TO ARRIVÉ AT.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M

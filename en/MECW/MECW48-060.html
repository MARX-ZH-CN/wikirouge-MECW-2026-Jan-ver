ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL</p>
<p>IN PLAUEN NEAR DRESDEN</p>
<p>Eastbourne, 30 August 1887</p>
<p>Dear Bebel,</p>
<p>I am tremendously glad that you are so willing to fall in with my little plan.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I shall expect to see you in London in the early part of October and only regret that you cannot come straight away and spend a week here in the bracing sea air. My house still being at sixes and sevens, I have had to stay here another week but we shall be going home on Friday, 2 September.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Everything else I shall leave until we meet but, since you are going to Hamburg, just one more word. I have been corresponding with Wedde about a plan they have been hatching there. Unfortunately, however, I could not comply with his wishes since the plan—at any rate so far as I could judge from what Wedde told me—had been worked out in total ignorance of the law in this country and, more especially, of procedure in civil cases.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Might I now ask you, when in Hamburg, to get Wedde to explain the whole plan in detail to you again so that we can discuss it exhaustively over here, for if the thing is at all feasible, I would gladly do all I could, both for the sake of the cause and to oblige Wedde. If the worst comes to the worst and nothing can be done, I hope to convince you that such is really the case, and even this would mean quite a lot to me.</p>
<p>So in about 3 or 4 weeks' time I hope to hear when you will be arriv- ing. In the meantime please remember me most kindly to your wife and daughter.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> With warmest regards,</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

Wedde asked Engels either to deposit this money to his name or help find a man who might mediate in this transaction.</span>

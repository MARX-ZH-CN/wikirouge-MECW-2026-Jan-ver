ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester,] 15 March 1869</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Enclosed, Meissner returned.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>Today only the following: Even in the past I considered that <i>Bonaparte"</i> really ought to be printed together with your 3 articles in the <i>Revue</i> about the period from February 1848 to 1850<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>; but I thought that it would cause too much loss of time. Since, however, Meissner <i>himself</i> is delaying, I would <i>still do</i> this <i>now.</i> This will make the whole thing more voluminous—ca. 10-12 printed sheets—and more complete.</p>
<p>If you write to Meissner right away, I am sure there will be enough time.</p>
<p>More tomorrow.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p>Lizzie is in bed with bronchitis and a bad cold; somewhat better today.

Note from MECW vol. 4, 1975 :</p><blockquote>
<p>These entries in Marx's Notebook for 1844-1847 immediately precede the famous "<a class="mw-redirect" href="MECW05-003.html">Theses on Feuerbach</a>", written in April 1845. In content the notes correspond to the first point of the "<a href="MECW04-044.html">Draft Plan for a Work on the Modern State</a>" given above-evidence that in the first months of his stay in Brussels Marx had not abandoned the plan of writing a work on the French Revolution, but still could not carry it out at that stage. The ideas briefly recorded in his notes have much in common with a number of those developed in <i><a href="MECW04-002.html">The Holy Family</a></i>.

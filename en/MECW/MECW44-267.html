ENGELS TO THEODOR CUNO</p>
<p>IN NEW YORK</p>
<p>London, 29 October 1872
122 Regent's Park Road, N.W.</p>
<p>Dear Cuno,</p>
<p>Received your letter of the 8th and the minutes<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>; many thanks for both.</p>
<p>The <i>Bulletin jurassien,</i> which you will have received,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>and the <i>Internationale</i> of Brussels, which is going off today, will prove to you that we must really get down to it and that it is absolutely essential for <i>Sorge</i> at least to shake off his reservations and agree to an election<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>so that not just unity of action but above all action itself can be ensured. If we do not, without further ado, take energetic steps to suspend the Jurassians because of their Congress resolutions, which ride roughshod over the Rules and the Hague resolutions,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>and to expel the members of the anti-authoritarian Congress,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>in so far as they belong to the International at all, and to proclaim and justify such actions, then these people really will become altogether too cocksure. Time is still on our side: the Belgians are frightened by their own initial courage and are vacillating, in Spain the opposition to the Alliance people is growing stronger by the day, they are already calling for an extraordinary Spanish congress to examine the behaviour of the Federal Council and the delegates in The Hague—but all of this will go cold if the impertinent behaviour of the Jurassians is tolerated. And you can see from Hales' letter in the <i>Internationale</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>that these men will do their utmost.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>Hales is the Jurassians' correspondent and distributes their <i>Bulletin</i> with its filthy articles here gratis to anyone who will take it and he sends it to all the sections.</p>
<p>I must close now to catch the post. Marx and I are overloaded as never before with work on the Congress, preparing things for print, and with correspondence.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>Sorge will have received the <i>Emancipación,</i> you can translate it for him. The next steamer will bring another few issues. Along with the <i>Volksstaat</i> it is our best paper.</p>
<p>The business with West amused us greatly. We all send our best regards to Sorge and yourself.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. Engels</p>
<p>Lafargue and wife<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>arrived here the day before yesterday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup></p>

The congress voted down the resolutions of the Hague Congress; a report on it was printed by the <i>Bulletin de la Fédération jurassienne,</i> Nos. 17 and 18, 15 September-1 October 1872. The Jura Federation congress was held immediately before an anarchist congress in Saint-Imier, which likewise opposed the decisions of the Hague Congress (see Note 599).</span>

<li id="cite_note-5"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-5">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">On 15-16 September an extraordinary congress of organisations comprising the Bakuninist Alliance was held in<i> Saint-Imier,</i> Switzerland. The congress decided not to recognise the resolutions of the Hague Congress and the powers of the General Council. It concluded the 'Pacte d'amitié de solidarité et de défense mutuelle' for the purpose of campaigning against the federations and sections of the International Working Men's Association which supported the decisions of the Fifth Congress at The Hague. The anarchist congress also adopted a special resolution rejecting political struggle on the part of the working class and denying the need to establish an independent proletarian political party. The congress issued an address to the sections of the International urging them to convene, six months later, an 'anti-authoritarian' congress.</span>

The results of the discussion were incorporated into a number of resolutions passed by the Congress, notably into resolutions of Section IV (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 246-48). The official version of the Hague Congress resolutions was written and edited by Marx and Engels, who were on the committee (together with Eugène Dupont, Léo Frankel, Auguste Serraillier and Benjamin Le Moussu) appointed to prepare the Congress minutes and resolutions for publication. The official edition appeared in November 1872 in French as a separate pamphlet; on 14 December 1872,<i> The International Herald,</i> No. 37, carried the official English version.</span>

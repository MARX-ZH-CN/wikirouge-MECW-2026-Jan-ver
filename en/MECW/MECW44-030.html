<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>The onslaughts of the rheumatism were so severe that the family council resolved to send me to London to consult Dr Maddison. Hence went to London on Saturday afternoon from where I am returning to Ramsgate today.</p>
<p>Consulted Maddison yesterday. Says it is a severe form of SCIATICA. Prescribed medicine and also some stuff to rub in. Sojourn by the sea is beneficial to my GENERAL STATE OF HEALTH which is somewhat impaired by my sleeplessness. He is in favour of taking a hot sea-water bath on very warm days.</p>
<p>In Paris they seem concerned only to keep the population at bay until the necessary measures have been taken to make the interim secure for the TRUSTEES of the Orléans.</p>
<p>Salut</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>

Did you read the lousy letter from Louis Blanc?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>The essence of patriotism is to remain passive so as to force the Bonapartists to shoulder the entire responsibility.</p>
<p>That Scottish jackass Elcho seems to imagine that he is the British Moltke.</p>
<p>Freiligrath. "Hurrah! Germania!" Neither "god" nor the "Gaul" are missing from this laboriously long-winded song.

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 21 MAY 1869</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>Tussy and my wife returned from Paris on Wednesday,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and I intended to come to Manchester with Tussy tomorrow. In the meantime, this has been made impossible by an economic obstacle.</p>
<p>The various Paris journeys by Jenny, Tussy and Madame, and the purchases connected therewith, have naturally entailed extra expenditure for me. Second, there were borrowings to a sum of £14, which I absolutely could not avoid, BY AN UNHAPPY coincidence of circumstances. Dupont, the soundest of the people here, has not only <i>chômage</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> but his wife is hopelessly ill. He is such a discreet man that he borrows from nobody, except in extreme need, and he is so conscientious that he always pays back. So I loaned him £6. Then along came Lessner, put into difficult circumstances by his wife's long and finally fatal illness. I could deny him all the less since I was myself his debtor for a long time. Thus <i>£5.</i> Finally the worthy Liebknecht (after writing to me <i>in vain</i> on the subject) writes to Eccarius himself, asking him to approach me for an advance. I told Eccarius that I had already turned Wilhelm down. But Eccarius wailed—and this is a fact—that he would be turned out of the house if I did not advance him at least <i>£2</i> for rent owing. I thus did this, but at the same time wrote to Wilhelm that he should return it to me. So £14 OUT OF POCKET. All this left me with £15 lying <i>in petto.</i> But then, yesterday, A CERTAIN Drengler <i>(nomen omen</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <i>)</i> arrived from the City with a letter from Mr Zitschke in New York, who <i>13 years ago</i> loaned me £15, and then suddenly disappeared from London because of embezzlement (he dispatched emigrants to New York). TURNS NOW UP AGAIN with the old loan, which I had thought settled by his defection with the cash. I had to deal with the matter all the more because, in the meantime, he has become friendly with Mr Heinzen; in the event of a refusal to pay, he would have been able to 'Pioneer me out'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> Thus cleaned out.</p>
<p>Fox has died in Vienna after a 5-day pulmonary disease. His family left in poverty. Letters on this have reached me from Vienna. Fox's mother (Peter Fox <i>nom de plume,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> real name Peter Fox André) is a rich woman, who, however, left him completely in the lurch, partly because he married her abigail (now old), and partly because of his atheism. I have now approached her, <i>threatening</i> that if she does not give something, public collections will be held for her son in London.</p>
<p>Meissner sent me, 1 week ago, the 1st sheet of the <i>18th Brumaire,</i> and wrote that things should now go 'quickly'. But sheet 2 is not here yet. He appears to be dragging the matter out as long as possible.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

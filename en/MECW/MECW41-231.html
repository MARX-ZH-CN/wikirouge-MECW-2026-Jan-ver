ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester, 31 July 1862]</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>No doubt you will understand that, after the heavy outgoings last month, it will be impossible for me to get hold of £25 for you just now. I have postponed till August all heavy outgoings on my own account (LANDLADY and quarterly account), moreover, because of the bill, I have had to give Borkheim an order, which will similarly have to be met in August. I shall see what can be done before tomorrow. I still owe Lupus £10, and he will ask for it immediately on his return,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> which might be any day now. If you</p>
<p>add this to last month's outgoings, you will see that it takes a tidy slice out of the new financial year. However, I shall see this evening how much will have to be paid out, and hence how much I shall be able to send you.</p>
<p>If only I knew what the balance looked like and how I stand! But the day after tomorrow Charles<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> leaves for Warsaw, where we have incurred a bad debt, and then the whole caboodle will come to a dead stop again.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

<p>Cit. <i>Marx</i> proposed that the Council should cut off all connections with the <i>Bee-Hive.</i> He said it had suppressed our resolutions and mutilated our reports and delayed them so that the dates had been falsified, even the mention that certain questions respecting the Irish prisoners were being discussed had been suppressed.</p>
<p>Next to that, the tone of the <i>Bee-Hive</i> was contrary to the Rules and platform of the Association. It preached harmony with the capitalists, and the Association had declared war against the capitalists' rule.</p>
<p>Besides this, our branches abroad complained that by sending our reports to the <i>Bee-Hive</i> we gave it a moral support and led people to believe that we endorsed its policy. We would be better without its publicity than with it.</p>
<p>On the Irish Coercion Bill<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>it had not said a word against the government.

Aimed against the national liberation movement, the Bill provided for the suspension of constitutional guarantees in Ireland, the introduction of a state of siege and the granting of extraordinary powers to the English authorities for the struggle against Irish revolutionaries. The Bill was passed by the English Parliament.</span>

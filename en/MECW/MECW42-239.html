MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 14 August 1867</p>
<p>Dear FREDERICK,</p>
<p>As you will see from the enclosed, I am threatened with distraint if I do not pay the taxes (amounting to £ll-9s.) next Friday. I have an additional £1-15s. interest to pay to the pawnshop at the end of this week, or the things will lapse. I did not tell you of all these abominations before, as I had previously been attempting—vainly, I'm afraid—to rustle up the money in London.</p>
<p>With the huge sums that you have sent me this year, there would be no such PRESSURE, if it had not been for over £200 in previous debts. If I am to straighten out my affairs and not to PRESSURE you so dreadfully, it is imperative that I raise a loan somewhere else, even if another journey to the Continent is required for the purpose. But I cannot lift a finger until the printing is complete.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I received the 48th sheet today. So this week the whole vile business will be over.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

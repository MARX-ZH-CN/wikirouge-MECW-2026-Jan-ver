ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 19 March 1868</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Enclosed £40 in two twenties, which, it is to be hoped, will suffice at least for the most urgent purposes. I had not expected that Löhrchen<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>would be making a honeymoon trip to America. So the wedding is on 8 April, a Wednesday; had it been Friday, Saturday or Monday I could have got away easily.</p>
<p>The things from old Maurer are very nice<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>; it is really remarkable how much material already exists on these subjects, and how little the professors have been able to make of it.</p>
<p>I shall try to discover the Anglo-Saxon word, but, since no Anglo-Saxon dictionary is available to me here, I shall have to make do with other sources, which are very dubious, in view of the large and peculiar stock of words in Anglo-Saxon. First of all, the correct spelling must be determined. With regard to <i>Wiffa,</i> a question: where is it found, so we might know whether it has Low German or High German sound shifts. If it is High German you should compare Graff's <i>Althochdeutscher Sprachschatz,</i> the <i>Bayerisches Wörterbuch</i> by Schindler or the Swiss dictionary by Stalder. Does it not occur in Grimm's <i>Rechtsalterthümer?</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The accursed business with the ill-fated Schiller Institute here,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>which Gumpert once pushed me into and then did nothing further, is finally reaching a crisis, and the matter will be decided by Wednesday. During these days I must—<i>étant engagé</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>—make a great effort; I shall therefore scarcely be left with time in this period to write the English article.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>From the middle of next week onwards I shall have peace, and will press ahead without pause. Regarding this business here, there is every prospect that I—and everything depends upon me—shall bring everything to a happy conclusion despite Borchardt and various other German cliques. Since I have been involved in the business for 4 years, and victory or defeat fall on my head, I simply <i>must.</i></p>
<p>Since you say nothing about carbuncles, I assume that everything is fading without further issue.</p>
<p>The most conscientious reader of your book<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>here is Sam Moore; he has really worked his way thoroughly through over 600 pages and is grinding indefatigably on.</p>
<p>Best greetings.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p>So, Plon-Plon, according to <i>The Times</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>should inaugurate the Russian-Prussian-French alliance. This Bonaparte seems to get into a worse position every day. The stupid Prussians are continually making arrests and searching houses in the annexed lands.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup>The proofs<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup>and the Dühring<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup>will be dispatched today or tomorrow.

<li id="cite_note-6"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-6">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The <i>Schiller Institute</i>, founded in Manchester in November 1859 in connection with the centenary of Friedrich Schiller's birth, strove to be a German emigre cultural and social centre. Engels was critical of the Institute, noted for its tendency to formalism and pedantry, and he initially kept aloof from it. But when certain changes were introduced into its Rules, he became a member of its Directorate in 1864. Later, as the President of the Institute, Engels devoted much time to it and exercised a considerable influence on its activities.<br>In September 1868, while Engels was away from Manchester, the Institute invited Karl Vogt, who was connected with the Bonapartists and was slandering the proletarian revolutionaries, to deliver a lecture. Engels felt that his political reputation would be compromised if he remained President and so he left the Directorate. In April 1870 he was again elected a member of the Directorate of the Schiller Institute, but did not take an active part in it.</span>

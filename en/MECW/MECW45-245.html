ENGELS TO ERNST DRONKE</p>
<p>IN LIVERPOOL</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>London, 29 November 1878</p>
<p>My dear Dronke,</p>
<p>I hear from Messrs Whitley and Maddock that you informed them of your intention not to have the assignment of the Policy executed. Moreover I have not had a word of reply or explanation from yourself. Under these circumstances I can only again repeat, that the Policy belongs to Mrs Dronke and that you had no right whatever to dispose of it. It is therefore no security for me unless assigned by her in the form prescribed by law. Unless this is done, I shall know how to qualify the transaction, and of course shall not pay any premium to keep it in existence.</p>
<p>Yours truly
</p>

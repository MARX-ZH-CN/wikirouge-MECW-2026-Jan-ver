ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Eastbourne, 24 August 1886<br>4 Cavendish Place</p>
<p>Dear Kautsky,</p>
<p>I have been completely crushed, smothered, squashed and stultified by your avalanche of letters this morning. I shall have to see how I can manage to answer them. Very many thanks.</p>
<p>Liebknecht has written to say he may set off for London as early as tomorrow, taking the direct route via Flushing—I am expecting more definite word any day; as soon as I know the day he's arriving, I shall come up for the day and bring him back here. I shouldn't buy him an <i>Esel</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> if I were you, he can write perfectly well on board ship without an <i>Esel.</i> Or is he expecting to be seasick all the time? But so far no <i>Esel</i> has been able to cope with seasickness.</p>
<p>Old Becker<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> will be arriving from Geneva on the 12th-13th to stay with me in London.</p>
<p>Mother Schack has announced her intention of coming to London in the middle of September along with the Wischnewetzkys.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>If Schorlemmer and the Lafargues turn up as well — postcard arrived 16th August from Schorlemmer in Bellaggio, Lake of Como — it will be pretty hectic.</p>
<p>We shall be staying here until 4 September — a week on Saturday.</p>
<p>Nim and the Pumpses send their best wishes to your wife and yourself, as does</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F.E.
</p>

ENGELS T O H E R M A N N SCHLÜTER
<br>IN HOTTINGEN-ZURICH
<br>[London], 23 January 1888
<br>Dear Mr Schlüter,
<br>You should have the <i>Theory of Force</i> by 20 February; you would be getting it even sooner but for the intervention of the English translation of the <i>Manifesto</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> which I must polish off quickly with Sam Moore, the translator of <i>Capital,</i> who is here with me, otherwise I shall be missing a splendid opportunity.
<br>As soon as that is done—by the end of the week—I'll go back to the final part of the <i>Theory of Force,</i> which provides a rapid survey of historical events between 1848 and 1888 in so far as they are applicable to the subject. This time I shall annoy Bismarck even more than I did with my <i>Schnaps.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>Kindest regards.
<br>Yours,
<br>F. E.
<br>The only thing that might possibly intervene would by my eyesight, for which I'm receiving treatment so as to get the wretched business properly over and done with—but in that case I shall write.

The publication of this work, exposing the Prussian Junkers, in the newspaper Volksstaat and in the form of a reprint, caused exasperation in government quarters. Therefore the promulgation of Engels' works in Germany was banned.</span>

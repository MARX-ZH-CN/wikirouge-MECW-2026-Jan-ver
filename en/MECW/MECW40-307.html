MARX TO FERDINAND LASSALLE<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN BERLIN</p>
<p>[London,] 22 November 1859</p>
<p>Dear Lassalle,</p>
<p>For one thing today is mailing day for America<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>; for another I have taken medicine. So writing is difficult either way. Hence I shall be quite brief.</p>
<p><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>1. THANKS for your last letter but one. I shall, however, probably succeed in arranging a bill <i>on myself</i> here in London, at an exorbitant rate of interest.</p>
<p>2. You had best abandon your anti-Vogt statement now that the <i>Reform</i> has already printed a statement of mine.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>My chief concern now is to compel Mr Vogt to pursue the matter in London.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>3. I have told Freiligrath that you have praised his poem on Schiller and criticised his conduct towards you.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>He will now write to you. Read No. 43 of the <i>Gartenlaube</i> wherein Kinkel's sycophant, Mr Beta (sometime editor of the <i>How do you do?</i> published here by <i>Louis Drucker,</i> and presently <i>faiseur-en-chef</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>of the <i>Hermann,</i> whose EDITORS are all recruited from the literary</p>
<p><i>Lumpenproletariat),</i> makes the discovery that Freiligrath 'seldom sang any more' after he had been 'inspired' by me.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>During recent years Freiligrath has been whoring too much after the idols of Babylon, so great is his thirst for popularity. His wife may not be an altogether beneficent influence IN THIS RESPECT. I will dilate no further on this theme, except to say that I show more considera- tion for old personal and party friends than seems right to many very clever people in our party.</p>
<p>4. <i>Ad vocem</i> <i>Bonaparte.</i> So far as I can see, the Italian war<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>has temporarily strengthened Bonaparte's position in France; betrayed the Italian revolution into the hands of the Piedmontese doctrinaires and their henchmen; made Prussia exceptionally popular with the liberal <i>vulgus</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup>by virtue of her Haugwitzian policy; increased <i>Russia's</i> influence in Germany; and, finally, propagated demoralisation of an unprecedented kind—a most repulsive combination of Bonapartism and drivel about nationalities. I for my part fail to see any reason why members of our party had to give dialectical support to these nauseous, counter-revolutionary illusions of philistine-liberal provenance. It is my belief that, from the moment when Disraeli publicly admitted the existence of an alliance between Bonaparte and Russia,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup>and more especially from the moment when Russia sent out her shameless circular note to the German courts,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup>the battle-cry should have been raised against the.Russo-French</p>
<p>alliance. Opposition to Russia would instandy have disposed of the delusion that there was anything anti-liberal about a turning against France.</p>
<p>Schleinitz's despatches,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup>which I have studied in detail, together with the statements made by the ministers over here, some direct to Parliament, some in the press, confirm my view that <i>Prussia</i> had no intention of intervening so long as the German frontier was not violated. Bonaparte, as the protégé of Russia and England, had at the time been given permission to conduct a 'localised' war in order to keep him in France. Prussia would not have dared lift a finger and, had she done so, there would have been war between Germany and Russia, than which nothing could be more desirable. But IN FACT there was no question of it, because Prussia would <i>never</i> have had the courage to take such a step. Rather it was a question, partly of exposing the Prussian government in all its miserable weakness, partly and above all of unmasking Bonapartist DELUSIONS. Nor would the game have been too difficult, since all the representatives of the revolutionary party from Mazzini to Louis Blanc, Ledru-Rollin and even Proudhon would have joined in. This would have meant that the polemic against Bonaparte's imposture could not have acquired the appearance of hostility to Italy or France.</p>
<p>I am not, of course, going into the matter thoroughly here, but merely jotting down a few points. However, I shall, with your permission, make one further observation. There is a possibility that things will come to a head again soon. In that case one of two things must prevail in our party: either no one speaks for the party without prior consultation with the others, or everyone has the right to put forward his views without any regard for the others. Now this last is certainly not to be recommended, since a public polemic would in no way benefit so small a party (which, I hope, makes up in vigour for what it lacks in numbers). I can only say that, during my travels through England and Scotland (this summer)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup>—for our old party friends are scattered about the country—I did not find anybody here who would not have wished you had modified your pamphlet<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup>in many respects. I see a quite simple explanation for this, namely that foreign policy, in</p>
<p>particular, presents a very different aspect according to whether you view it from English soil or from the Continent.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

The war (29 April to 8 July 1859) was launched by Napoleon III, who under the banner of the 'liberation of Italy' strove for aggrandizement and needed a successful military campaign to shore up the Bonapartist regime in France. Piedmont ruling circles hoped that French support would enable them to unite Italy under the aegis of the Savoy dynasty. The war caused an upsurge of the national liberation movement in Italy. The Austrian army suffered a series of defeats. However Napoleon III, frightened by the scale of the liberation movement in Italy, abruptly ceased hostilities. On 11 July, the French and Austrian emperors concluded a separate preliminary peace in Villafranca. France received Savoy and Nice; Lombardy was annexed to Sardinia; the Venetian Region remained under the Austrians.—380, 399, 401, 405, 462, 537</span>

Russia undertook to adopt a 'political and military stand which most easily proves its favourable neutrality towards France' and not to object to the enlargement of the Kingdom of Sardinia in the event of a war between France and Sardinia on the one hand and Austria on the other. Information about this secret treaty leaked into the press but the Russian Foreign Minister Gorchakov officially denied the existence of any written obligations to France. Marx refers to this treaty in his article 'The Financial Panic' (present edition, Vol. 16).—430, 537</span>

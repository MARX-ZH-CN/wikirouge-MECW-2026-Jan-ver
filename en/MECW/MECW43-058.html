MARX TO ENGELS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 13 August 1868</p>
<p>I hope that these lines will reach you before your departure, for there is <i>periculum in mora.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>Firstly,<i> I must send money to Ramsgate, so they can stay there another week. As their departure was delayed for weeks after your last remittance, smaller domestic debts were paid; on the other hand, my wife had to retrieve watches and other things from the pawnshop so that they could appear RESPECTABLE at the watering place.</i></p>
<p><i>Secondly,</i> one of the <i>épiciers</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>who is owed £6 and a few shillings, must be paid this week, since the man is shutting up shop.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly,</i> I have already received 2 SUMMONS for QUEENS TAXES (about £8). The LOCAL TAXES are paid, as you know. I absolutely cannot put off these sums.</p>
<p>For two further pressing items—the LANDLORD, who is unfortu- nately in London now, and a bill of exchange for £12 payable on the 25th of this month—I shall still perhaps receive money in time from Germany.</p>
<p>I have written to my cousins August and Karl Philips in Amsterdam and Aachen in order to find out whether they are back.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>It would be a sheer waste of money to go to the continent in order to borrow, before one is sure that the people are there.</p>
<p>For the past week I have not had a wink of sleep and <i>l'illustre</i> Gaudissart<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>Borkheim, who visited me the day before yesterday to take leave, said I really should get rid of my jaundice. He entertained me with the story of the £1,000 he is trying to blackmail out of Oppenheim.</p>
<p>In great haste.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

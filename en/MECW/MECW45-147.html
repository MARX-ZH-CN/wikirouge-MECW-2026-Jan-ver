MARX TO ENGELS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN BRIGHTON</p>
<p>[London,] 5 March 1877</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>Dühringiana enclosed.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I found it impossible to read the fellow without belabouring him constantly and at some length.</p>
<p>Now, having thus familiarised myself with him (and the section from Ricardo onwards, which I've not yet read, must contain many exquisite pearls), a task that required patience and a club ready to hand, I shall in future be capable of enjoying him in tranquillity. Once one sees how the laddie's mind works, so that one really gets the hang of his method, he proves to be a fairly entertaining SCRIBBLER. Meanwhile, what with my catarrh and consequent irritability, he has done me yeoman service by providing a secondary 'occupation'.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Moor</p>
<p>Apropos. That most virulent article on Gladstone-Novikova, the sight of which had caused the <i>Whitehall Review</i> to quake in its boots, appeared yesterday in <i>Vanity Fair,</i> with improvements by Barry.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> As we could see, when Collet's son and daughter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> came to visit us yesterday, it has met with Papa Collet's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> disapproval, Gladstone being, after all, an honest though crazy man, and a polemic of this sort 'indecent'.

Barry was working on essays dealing with Gladstone's foreign policy that were published by several conservative papers. The <i>Vanity Fair</i> of 3 March 1877, for example, carried Barry's article 'Mr. Gladstone', and of 10 March its sequel, 'The Great Agitator Unmasked'.</span>

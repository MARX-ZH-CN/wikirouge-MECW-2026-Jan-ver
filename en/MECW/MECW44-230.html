MARX TO CÉSAR DE PAEPE
<br>IN BRUSSELS
<br>[London,] 28 May 1872
<br>My dear Friend,
<br>Enclosed is a statement by the General Council against Vésinier
<br><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>and Co.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> for the Brussels <i>L'Internationale.</i> The same thing has been sent to the <i>Liberté,</i>
<br>1) because it needs publicity, 2) because Mr Steens <i>has suppressed</i> the General Council's reply to the British Parliament which was sent to him.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> <br>I have read the report on the Belgian Congress<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> in the <i>L'Internationale.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> How is it that the Flemish are not included among the delegates? Generally speaking, according to the information received here by the French from their compatriots, it would not seem that the International has made much headway in Belgium after the events of the Commune.
<br>For my part I should be ready to accept the Hins draft (with modifications of detail), not because I think it is good, but because it is always better to make certain experiments than to lull oneself with illusions.
<br>It is very characteristic of the Alliance's tactics: in Spain, where it is strongly organised although it has lost the support of the Spanish Federal Council, it attacked at the Barcelona Council all elements of organisation, the Federal Council, etc., as well as the General Council. In Belgium, where 'prejudices' have to be taken into account, it has been proposed that the General Council be abolished with its functions being transferred to the Federal Councils (this was opposed at Barcelona) and even enlarged.
<br>I can hardly wait for the next Congress. It will be the end of my slavery. After that I shall become a free man again; I shall accept no administrative functions any more, either for the General Council or for the British Federal Council.
<br>Yours as ever,
<br>Karl Marx

Under this draft, which was written by Eugène Hins, the powers of the General Council to all intents and purposes were to be annulled and the Council turned into a mere correspondence and statistical bureau. After heated debates the congress decided to submit the draft for discussion by the sections, and then for approval by the Federation's extraordinary congress scheduled for July 1872 (see Note 568).</span>

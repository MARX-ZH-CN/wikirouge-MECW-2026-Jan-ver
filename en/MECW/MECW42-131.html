MARX TO ENGELS
<br>IN MANCHESTER
<br>[London,] 14 February 1866
<br>Dear FRED,
<br>Most sincere thanks for the first half of the £50 note. In respect of the 'Viennese',<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I wrote him LONG SINCE that he should write to you. I told him I was agreeable to anything, except that I did not know UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES if I would be capable of supplying a contribution for the first issue.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>That cur of a carbuncle is working away, but I hope to be rid of it in a few days.
<br>Things are really aboil in Prussia. Yet the patience of our friends is great. If Bismarck sends them home, everything will now result in banqueting and Kappel-Klassenmann.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> On the other hand, if the Chamber sits for long, the outcome may be nasty. <i>Salut.</i>
<br>Your
<br>K. M.

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">On 2 January 1866, Austrian journalist Arnold Hilberg from Vienna wrote to Marx inviting him to contribute to the planned journal <i>Internationale Revue.</i> Marx's reply to him has not been found, but from Hilberg's next letter to Marx, of 18 January, it is clear that Marx agreed (see also Marx's letter TO ENGELS of 14 February in this volume, p. 229). However, his work in the International and on <i>Capital</i> presumably prevented Marx from materialising his intention.</span>

<li id="cite_note-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-3">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">A banquet of the opposition liberal majority of the Chamber of Deputies, organised by the Rhineland men of Progress (see Note 99) headed by the Town Councillor Classen-Kappelmann, was scheduled for 22-23 July 1865, in Cologne. On 17 July the Bismarck government forbade the banquet. Despite numerous protests on the part of the workers in the various towns of Germany against this arbitrary measure, most opposition members did not dare to show open resistance. Only some 80 delegates out of the 250 invited arrived in Cologne. The banquet's organiser, Classen-Kappelmann, fearing arrest, left for Belgium. Since the hall where the banquet was to take place had been closed by the police, the deputies tried to hold the banquet in the Zoological Gardens, but were driven out of it by soldiers and policemen.</span>

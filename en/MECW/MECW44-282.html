ENGELS TO EUGEN OSWALD
<br>IN LONDON
<br>[London,] 29 January 1873 122 Regent's Park Road
<br>Dear Oswald,
<br>My wife<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and I thank you cordially for your kind invitation, but we are unfortunately not yet in a position to say whether we shall be able to take it up. My wife has again been plagued by all sorts of illnesses ever since Christmas; she is suffering from the after-effects of pleurisy, and so it is very doubtful whether she will be able to go out in the evening—it would be the first time for 2 weeks. For my part, I have promised the German Workers' Society<sup>13s</sup> that I would, if required, put in an appearance at the meeting on Saturday evening and give a talk, and I shall be unlikely to hear before Friday whether it is due to take place this Saturday or the following one.
<br>When your children came yesterday afternoon I was just working with Marx on something that absolutely had to go off by the first post and so could not get away for a moment. My wife believes that Pumps<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> delivered 'A SAUCY MESSAGE' instead of my words:
<br>TELL THEM TO GIVE OUR COMPLIMENTS TO M R AND MRS OSWALD, AND THAT WE ARE
<br>MUCH OBLIGED [tO t h e m ], BUT THAT I CANNOT JUST NOW TELL WHETHER WE CAN COME. If this is the case, you now know what happened. Our best regards to Mrs Oswald and to your sister.
<br>Sincerely yours,
<br>F. Engels

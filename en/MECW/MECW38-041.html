<p><i>To Engels in Paris</i>
</p>
<h4 class="mw-headline" id="ME38-41-2">Brussels, 15 May 1847</h4><a id="Brussels,_15_May_1847"></a>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>As you know, Vogler has been under arrest in Aachen since the beginning of May. [The original is inaccurate: Vogler was arrested at the beginning of April 1847 and returned to Brussels on 17 June] This has for the time being precluded the possibility of getting the pamphlet [Engels, The Constitutional Question in Germany] you sent here into print. The first 1/3 of it I liked very much. The other 2/3 will in any case need some alteration. Something more specific on this point in my next.</p>
<p>
I enclose the print of your cartoon. I sent it to the <i>Brüsseler-Zeitung</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p><div class="center"><div class="floatnone"><a href="https://wikirouge.net/texts/en/w/File:Engels_Cartoon_Frederick_William_IV_May_1847.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" data-file-height="771" data-file-width="977" decoding="async" height="613" src="MECW38-img001.png" srcset="/texts/en/w/images/5/52/Engels_Cartoon_Frederick_William_IV_May_1847.png 1.5x" width="777"/></a></div></div><p>As for the truly nauseous article by Grün or his associates in the <i>Trier'sche Zeitung</i> [Reference to a report from Paris of 13 April published in the section 'Frankreich' of the Trier'sche Zeitung, No. 107, 17 April 1847] it is of course now too late; it would have been good if at the outset you had published a two-line counterstatement in the same rag.</p>
<p>I cannot go to London, not having sufficient funds. But we hope to send Wolff over. And then it will be enough that the two of you are there.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Voce</i> [as regards] money:</p>
<p>You will remember that <i>Hess</i> owes me and my brother-in-law Edgar [von Westphalen] money from the <i>Gesellschaftsspiegel</i>. So I am drawing a bill on him from here, <i>payable</i> 30 days at <i>sight. Bernays</i> likewise has owed me <i>150 fr</i>. since May of last year. So he too will also be presented with a bill.</p>
<p>I would therefore ask you to do the following:</p>
<p>1. First send me the addresses of both;</p>
<p>2. Inform both of them of the facts and tell the jackasses</p>
<p>3. that if they believe they will be unable to pay the respective sums by 15 June, they are nevertheless to <i>accept</i> the bills. I shall then arrange for <i>cover</i> in Paris. Naturally you will <i>only</i> inform the jackasses of the <i>latter</i> if absolutely unavoidable.</p>
<p>At the moment I'm in such financial straits that I have had to have recourse to drawing bills, and after all I don't intend to make the two jackasses a present of anything. Should the asses only <i>feign</i> acceptance of the bills, I must, of course, know at once.</p>
<p>Since the matter is <i>very pressing,</i> I expect you not to let a day go by before setting everything in order and <i>informing</i> me.</p>
<p>Here in Brussels I have managed to hunt out an <i>escompteur.</i> [bill discounter]</p>
<p>I cannot write to you at any greater length. About 12 days ago Breyer let a <i>vein</i>, but in my <i>right</i> arm instead of the <i>left.</i> Since I went on working as though nothing had happened, the wound festered instead of closing. The thing could have been dangerous and cost me my arm. Now it's as good as healed. But the arm's still weak. Mustn't be overtaxed.</p>
<p>Your<br>Marx

<p>[From Gigot]</p>
<p><br>
My dear Fritzchen,</p>
<p>I am just in the middle of reading your pamphlet — so far it has amused me greatly — and feel really happy that I ain't no German. May God or Reason or Race preserve us from the petty bourgeoisie!</p>
<p><i>Avec laquelle j'ai l'honneur d'être</i>. [with which I have the honour to be]</p>
<p>Yours most truly<br>Philippe</p>
<p><br>
P.S. Do drop me <i>un demi mot</i> [a few words] sometime.
</p>

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The reference is to the congress of the League of the Just at which, as agreed between the League leaders in London (H. Bauer, J. Moll, K. Schapper) and Marx and Engels early in 1847, the League was to be reorganised. The congress was held between 2 and 9 June 1847. Engels represented the Paris communities, and Wilhelm Wolff, briefed by Marx, was a delegate of the Brussels communists.<br>Engels' active participation in the work of the congress affected the course and the results of its proceedings. The League was renamed the Communist League, the old motto of the League of the Just 'All men are brothers' was replaced by a new, Marxist one: 'Working Men of All Countries, Unite!' The congress expelled the Weitlingians from the League. The last sitting on 9 June approved the <a href="MECW06-015.html">draft programme</a> and the <a href="MECW06-076.html">draft Rules of the League</a>, which had been drawn up either by Engels or with his help. Both documents and the congress circular to the League members were sent to the local communities and districts for discussion to be finally approved at the next, second congress.<br>This congress laid the foundation for the first international proletarian communist organisation in history.</span>

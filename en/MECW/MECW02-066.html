<br>Bremen, March 12, 1839
<br>Dear Marie,
<br>(Continuation of my letter to Hermann.) The <em>Stadtbote</em> is full of absolute nonsense and I am writing poems about it at the office which ridicule it by always praising it to the skies, just incoherent twaddle, and I send it to the paper signed Th. Hildebrandt and they print it in all innocence. I have got one in my desk at this very moment which I am going to send in. It runs like this:
<br>Book Wisdom
<br><br>
He is not wise who from his reading draws
<br>Nothing but floods of useless erudition.
<br>For all his learning, life's mysterious laws
<br>Are a closed book beyond his comprehension.
<br>He who acquires a thorough textbook grounding
<br>In Botany, won't hear the grass that grows.
<br>Nor will he ever teach true understanding
<br>Who tells you all the dogma that he knows.
<br>Oh, no! the germ lies hid in man's own heart.
<br>Who seeks the art of. life must look within.
<br>Burning the midnight oil will not impart
<br>The secret of emotion's discipline.
<br>The man is lost who hears his own heart's voice
<br>And spurns it, Wilfully misapprehending.
<br>Of all your words so noble and so wise
<br>The most profound is human understanding.
<br><br>
So it goes, on and on, all mockery. Usually, when I am not quite sure what to send, I get hold of the Bote and scrape something together from that. The other day I sat Karl Leupold at my desk and dictated to him a rude letter to the Bote, <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> which they received and printed with the most fantastically stupid comments. But I must go out now. So I remain
<br>Your loving brother
<br>Friedrich

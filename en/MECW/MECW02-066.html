<p>Bremen, March 12, 1839</p>
<p>Dear Marie,</p>
<p>(Continuation of my letter to Hermann.) The <i>Stadtbote</i> is full of absolute nonsense and I am writing poems about it at the office which ridicule it by always praising it to the skies, just incoherent twaddle, and I send it to the paper signed Th. Hildebrandt and they print it in all innocence. I have got one in my desk at this very moment which I am going to send in. It runs like this:</p>
<p>Book Wisdom</p>
<p><br>
He is not wise who from his reading draws</p>
<p>Nothing but floods of useless erudition.</p>
<p>For all his learning, life's mysterious laws</p>
<p>Are a closed book beyond his comprehension.</p>
<p>He who acquires a thorough textbook grounding</p>
<p>In Botany, won't hear the grass that grows.</p>
<p>Nor will he ever teach true understanding</p>
<p>Who tells you all the dogma that he knows.</p>
<p>Oh, no! the germ lies hid in man's own heart.</p>
<p>Who seeks the art of. life must look within.</p>
<p>Burning the midnight oil will not impart</p>
<p>The secret of emotion's discipline.</p>
<p>The man is lost who hears his own heart's voice</p>
<p>And spurns it, Wilfully misapprehending.</p>
<p>Of all your words so noble and so wise</p>
<p>The most profound is human understanding.</p>
<p><br>
So it goes, on and on, all mockery. Usually, when I am not quite sure what to send, I get hold of the Bote and scrape something together from that. The other day I sat Karl Leupold at my desk and dictated to him a rude letter to the Bote, <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>which they received and printed with the most fantastically stupid comments. But I must go out now. So I remain</p>
<p>Your loving brother</p>
<p>Friedrich

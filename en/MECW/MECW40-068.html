ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>Manchester, 28 May 1857
<br>Dear Marx,
<br>Dana must be out of his mind to stipulate 1 page for aesthetics. Nor has the chap any inkling of military matters. See list of articles overleaf, occurring to me exclusively from <i>Brockhaus</i> and from memory. But since I must first check it against an <i>English</i> military encyclopaedia it can't be final; how could anyone remember all the technical expressions which in English begin with A? Apropos, there is an encyclopaedia of this kind by a hack of the most wretched variety, one J. H. Stocqueler. Could you make inquiries about price, scope, etc., etc.?
<br>And then, if you please, he wants to have the articles—of the desired thoroughness and brevity—over there by 1 July. Once again, typical Yankee. Anyway, it proves that they are counting more on SHOW than on real substance, as is already evident from the $2 per page.
<br>Send Dana the list—<i>as a provisional one</i>—and point out that since it's impossible to work ON SPECULATION at this PAY, he must say what he wants. (It's precisely these patched together articles, being the easiest, that make the PAY acceptable.) A 2nd list of <i>technical</i> expressions for A will follow very shortly. Once this is SETTLED he might just as well let us have the list up to D, E or G so that we can get on with it.
<br>I know nothing about Airey's (General) former career. You might look it up in an ARMY LIST, which will at least provide the bare bones.
<br>I know nothing about the <i>Spanish Armada</i> either, but this could be found—likewise <i>Ayacucho.</i>
<br>I'm not yet in sufficiently good shape to be able to come up tomorrow, and propose to leave on Saturday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Can one take a CAB from Camden STATION (to which one books the TICKETS) to your place? And how far is it?
<br>I shall bring Miquel's letter with me; because of my illness I haven't seen Lupus for a whole week.
<br>More when we meet. As you can imagine, I have my hands really full, what with arrears, etc., etc.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN EASTBOURNE<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ramsgate, 27 August 1879<br>

<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>Our letters keep crossing. No doubt you will have had mine (posted last Monday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> ); yours — of 25 August<sup>h</sup>—together with enclosures safely received.</p>
<p>I am only writing a line or two, as my wife is having to go somewhere near the post office, so you will get this acknowledge- ment of your letter before you leave.</p>
<p>I enclose for the <i>amusement</i> of yourself, Jollymeyer and Pumps,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Jennychen is doing well;<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> is not allowed to leave her room until next Monday and will then have to spend <i>at least another week</i> with us,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> as Longuet is going back to London earlier.</p>
<p>The weather has been deteriorating from day to day, but it's always tolerable for an hour or two and the SEA BRRFZE is beneficial, showers notwithstanding. It is Liebknecht himself who deserves the 'jackass' label he is seeking, with his habitual loutish courtesy, to pin on Hirsch — something he always does when 'caught' <i>in flagrante.</i></p>
<p>Best wishes to everyone.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Moor</p>
<p>Kovalevsky's address: 42 Gower Street.

ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 10 May 1860</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>My brother<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> left this evening because my mother is seriously ill and sent for him by telegram.</p>
<p>Matters have been pretty well settled with Ermen. My family is leaving capital amounting to £10,000 in the business, which it will have to make over to me when I become a partner. My material position will improve straight away, or at least the percentage of my share. I shall tell you all about this when I come down at Whitsun. Providing, that is, that everything's settled by then, and nothing has happened to my mother, so that I am, in fact, able to come. But I'm rather afraid she may have caught the infection from my father. I feel as though typhoid fever has now got a grip on our family.</p>
<p>About the other points, tomorrow. Siebel wants to know whether, amongst the papers he brought back, you have found the pamphlet, <i>Die Sphinx auf dem französischen Kaiserthron</i>; Schily has noticed that it's missing and is afraid he may have lost it.</p>
<p>Saw Lupus yesterday. The bone's still troubling him, and rheumatism into the bargain. It almost looks as though Gumpert's intervention is bringing the matter to a head, which is just as well, since it will be over all the sooner, and then L. will be back on his pins again.</p>
<p>Regards to the FAMILY.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

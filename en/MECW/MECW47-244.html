ENGELS TO HERMANN SCHLÜTER</p>
<p>IN HOTTINGEN-ZURICH</p>
<p>[London,] 3 March 1886</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Would you kindly send Williams &amp; Norgate, 14 Henrietta St., Covent Garden, London—1 copy of <i>Socialism: Utopian etc.</i> together with bill (incl. postage) in a wrapper—these people applied to me (they are my booksellers and, incidentally, publishers, a big firm) and I wrote and told them that my things are always to be had from the Volksbuchhandlung.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Mrs Wischnewetzky played you a rotten trick with her ms.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>For upon her insisting it was a matter of life and death, I had to buckle to straight away, and now the English translation of <i>Capital</i> has got to be done without delay, competition having cropped up (see <i>To-Day)</i> 527 in a menacing form. So if all is not to be lost, I must forge ahead and drop everything else, including the <i>Peasant War.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>The rival translation is, by the way, quite shocking, but so much the worse if it's not elbowed out forthwith.</p>
<p>Kindest regards,</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F.E.

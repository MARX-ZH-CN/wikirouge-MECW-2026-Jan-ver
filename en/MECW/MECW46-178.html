MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Postcard, unsigned]</p>
<p>Vevey, 4 September 1882<br>
Hôtel du Léman</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>Laura will be writing to you at length about events, or rather the uneventfulness here, since we are living in the Land of Cockaigne.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Like others, we have been for TRIPS on the LAKE.</p>
<p>On 3 1ST August I got Jennychen's letter enclosing your letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>and the CHEQJJE which last I handed in at the local bank of Genton et Co. for <i>encaissement</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>in Paris.</p>
<p>On 31 August, 1ST, 2ND and 3RD SEPTEMBER marvellous weather (too hot yesterday). Today wet and stormy; hope it won't degenerate into general rain. Odd that I should still be coughing; I think I'm the only person in Vevey who coughs; at all events I haven't met anyone else who does. My GENERAL STATE, however, is most satisfactory; with Laura I climbed not only to the top of the local vineyard, but also to the top of the much higher vineyard at Montreux, without feeling the slight- est discomfort.</p>
<p>I was called on at our hotel by a M R Songeon, <i>président du conseil mu- nicipal de Paris</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>; is one of the <i>réfugiés</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>whom I knew in London in 1849-1850. He presented me with the official report made to the <i>conseil municipal</i> of Paris by the deputation (amongst whom Mr Songeon) it had sent to Rome for Garibaldi's apotheosis<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>; the thing is mainly concerned with 'Songeon's' own apotheosis, since he always acted as spokesman for the other French delegates. Also showed me a copy of <i>Capital</i> which is to accompany him to the sylvan retreat not far removed from here, whither he was wending his way.</p>
<p>So far the English haven't made such rapid progress in Egypt 5 5 as Wolseley 'prognosticated'.</p>
<p>Mr Virchow, or so I see from the <i>supplément</i> to yesterday's <i>Journal de Genève,</i> has again demonstrated that he is far and away above</p>
<p>Darwin, he alone, in fact, being scientific and hence also 'contemp- tuous' of organic chemistry.</p>

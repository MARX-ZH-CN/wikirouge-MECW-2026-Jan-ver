HERMANN ENGELS TO LUDWIG SIEBOLD</p>
<p>IN SALE (CHESHIRE)</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London, 28 July 1895]</p>
<p>To L. Siebold, Esq., Sale, Cheshire</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>At the request of Mr F. Engels who is at present prevented by illness from writing in person, I am returning the enclosed letter to you. 636</p>
<p>These fragments will certainly not pass muster as a <i>History of Chemistry, 312</i> according to Mr Engels. But were you to entitle them <i>Researches in Magnetism</i> (or <i>Contributions to the History of Early Chemistry, Fragments by the late C. Schorlemmer,</i> or something of that kind) you would not have to get anyone to edit or finish off the work. If the worst comes to the worst, you will have to have recourse to a journal which specialises in the history of chemistry.</p>
<p>In sending you these views of Mr Engels at the latter's behest, I remain, etc.
</p>

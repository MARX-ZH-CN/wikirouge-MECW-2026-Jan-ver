<p>Dear Friend</p>
<p>I had an abscess (carbunculous) for about 12 days (not yet quite healed) on my left arm, like the one that I had under the left armpit while I was staying with Engels in Manchester. But that is not the reason why I have delayed until today my answer to your letter of 17 inst.</p>
<p>Since I would be most unwilling to cut across your plans, and was also personally interested in enjoying your company, I tried several ways of arranging the affair to fit in with your intentions. But it is <i>absolutely impossible</i>. At the end of August I <i>must</i> be in Holland with my relatives, where I have many affairs to settle that are of great interest and importance to me. My suggestion, to postpone the rendezvous to another time, was emphatically turned down because the people I am to meet are all tied to their business and can only meet me in Brussels at that particular time.</p>
<p>So I shall leave London about the end of August. You must let me know when you will be back in Hanover. I shall see how far I can regulate my further progress to fit in.</p>
<p>With best greetings to your dear wife and Fränzchen.</p>
<p>Yours<br><b>KM</b></p>

ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE</p>
<p>AT LE PERREUX</p>
<p>London, 20 September 1890</p>
<p>My dear Lafargue,</p>
<p>Thank you for the information about Caron.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Herewith my reply<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> to this amiable fellow who 'is in no doubt that my reply will be in the affirmative'. Don't talk to me of 'LONDON ASSURANCE' or YANKEE journalists' cheek. The Germans and French outdo them by far and, what's more, with an elegant effrontery that suits them to a T. However I'm not sure that it isn't my own dear countrymen who don't carry off first prize.</p>
<p>Nothing new to report here. Aveling must have written to you about Lavigerie.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> However it's very curious that this individual should have in his possession a document (copy) signed by Lafargue, Guesde, Deville, etc., announcing Guesde's impending arrival in London and a letter from Coulombeau inviting Aveling and Tussy to the Lille Congress<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> on behalf of the National Committee of the Workers' Party.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> The originals of all the documents he purports to have must have been seen by Aveling last Monday — but I've heard nothing since Sunday.</p>
<p>Herewith cheque for £20.</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>F.E.

It was attended by about 70 delegates, representing more than 200 party groups and trades unions from 97 towns and localities. The congress revised the party Rules and finally determined the composition and functions of the National Council. The following persons were elected to the Council for the period 1890-91: Jules Guesde, Louis Simon Dereure, Leon Camescasse, Quesnel, Georges Edouard Crépin, Paul Lafargue and Joseph Ferroul.<i> Le Socialiste</i> was made the party's official organ. The congress called for a peaceful demonstration to be held on 1 May 1891. It rejected the proposal for a general strike put forward by the 1888 Bordeaux trade union congress and pronounced for an international strike of miners as the vanguard of the working class capable of representing the interests of all workers. On the Workers' Party see Note 146.</span>

They established the National Council of the French Workers' Party, composed of Jules Guesde, Gabriel Deville, Louis Simon Dereure, Leon Camescasse, Georges Edouard Crépin, Paul Lafargue and Lenoel. The Council was to give practical leadership to the party and call its next congress.</span>

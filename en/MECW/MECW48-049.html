ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>London, 15 July 1887</p>
<p>My dear Laura,</p>
<p>Thanks for your letters. I have Schorlemmer still here; a chronic catarrh of the stomach, the great heat, and the absence of a very pressing wish to revisit his dear country keep him here. Besides him, Fritz Beust from Zürich, whom you saw here eight years ago, has arrived too. So I must confine myself to urgent matters.</p>
<p>I was obliged to give a card of introduction (to Paul) to a young Dr Conrad Schmidt of Königsberg, who dabbles in <i>question sociale.</i> He is about the greenest youth I ever saw, he was here about 3 months, seems a decent fellow, as decent fellows go nowadays, <i>frisst keine Schuhnägel und säuft keine Tinte<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></i> If Paul deposits him in rue Richelieu, Bibliothèque nationale, he will not trouble him much. He admires Zola in whom he has discovered the <i>materialistische Geschichtsanschauung<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></i></p>
<p>The Boulanger fit of paroxysm<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>ought to make our people demand again and again <i>l'armement du peuple</i> as the only guarantee against Caesaristic velleities on the part of popular generals. That is the only argument against the outcry of the Royalist press with regard to Boulanger being a danger to—the Republic they say, and the future monarchy they mean.</p>
<p>Saturday week, 23 July, we move to Eastbourne, 4 Cavendish Place,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>same as last year. If your Jersey trip is realised, let us know. I should not wonder if Tussy and Edward caught the Jersey fever.</p>
<p>Love from Nim, Jollymeier.</p>
<p>Yours affectionately</p>
<p>F. Engels

On 8 July 1887, when Boulanger was leaving for Clermont-Ferrand to assume command of the 13th Corps, his supporters staged a chauvinist demonstration at the Lyons railway station. Boulangism was a reactionary movement in France in the mid-1880s, led by ex-War Minister General Boulanger. It urged a revanchist war against Germany to win back Alsace, annexed by Germany in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71. In alliance with the monarchists, the Boulangists sought to capitalise on the masses' discontent with the government's policy. Their large-scale demagogic propaganda was especially effective among the lower ranks of the army. France was under the threat of a monarchist coup. Measures taken by the republican government, with the support of the progressive forces led to the collapse of the Boulangist movement. Its leaders fled from France.</span>

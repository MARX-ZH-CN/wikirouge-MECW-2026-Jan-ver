<blockquote>
<p>Marx was summoned before the examining magistrate on November 14, 1848, after the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> published the second article in the series "Counter-Revolution in Berlin" containing a call to refuse to pay taxes as a measure against the counter-revolutionary coup d'état in Prussia (see this volume, pp. 16-18). However, fearing the people's reaction to the persecution of the editors of a popular newspaper, the authorities confined themselves to confirming one of the charges brought against the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> earlier, after it had published the appeal "To the German People" by the republican Friedrich Hecker (see Note 93).

</blockquote>
<p>Cologne, November 13. The "rédacteur en chef" of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung has just received a fresh summons, for November 14, from the examining magistrate's court here.

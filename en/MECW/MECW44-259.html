ENGELS TO MALTMAN BARRY<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 15 September 1872</p>
<p>Dear Barry,</p>
<p>Marx wishes me to send you a few notes on the Hall of Science men,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> here they are, I hope they will prove sufficient. Marx said he would send you the circular of the General Council<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> relating to these fellows, but for safety's sake I enclose you a copy which please return.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>F. Engels<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>About April last a knot of men clubbed together, pretending to represent a few societies which nobody knows, and adopted the grandiloquent name of Universal Federalist Council of the I.W.M.A. and of the sections adhering to it.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> Not one of the societies they pretended to represent belonged to the International. Not one of themselves belonged to it, on the contrary, two of them had been expelled from it. But this was the very reason why they claimed the right to supersede the then existing General Council and to [take the] direction of the International into their own hands. A circular of that General Council held them up to the ridicule of Europe and they were silent for a time. Now these very same men reappear under the name of Universal Federalist Congress. We find here again the same Landeck who entered at the last trial of the International in Paris (June 1870) into a solemn engagement with the Prefect of Police<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> not to occupy himself anymore with politics or with the International,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> and [was] since expelled from the London society of French refugees.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> The same Vésinier, author of a whole library of Holywell street<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> literature <i>ad</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> Louis Napoleon, expelled from the International by a committee of the Brussels Congress in 1868, and from the London society of refugees in 1872. The same Schneider, denounced in the German Press as a disturber of workmen's meetings (the police used next morning to pay for the windows, glasses and furniture smashed by him and his helpmates) and as a swindler.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> The same Zielinski, his right hand man, the same Adolphe Smith, etc., we find moreover a few additional pretenders to fame such as the Pole Mileski who during the conference<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> translated all speeches into Polish for the exclusive benefit of himself, he being the only Pole present most of the time, and Oudet whose harebrained tomfooleries during the Commune are still in the recollection of many. Add a few German poor workingmen from the East End and you have the whole composition of this Universal Congress of twenty five rogues and fools.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">This letter has survived as a certified handwritten copy made from the original by John Burns, a leading figure in the British workers' movement, among whose papers it is kept at the British Museum Library. The copy of the letter is dated 15 September 1872, which may be incorrect. The letter is likely to have been written somewhat later, since it deals with the international Federalist Congress which took place in London on 16-19 September 1872. However, it is possible that having learned in advance about the convocation and agenda of the congress, Engels decided to give a description of its participants prior to its opening.</span>

Its agenda was published in the<i> Federation,</i> No. 4, 14 September 1872.</span>

The Council proclaimed itself a 'true' leading body of the International in a pamphlet called<i> Conseil fédéraliste  universel de l'Association Internationale des Travailleurs et des Sociétés républicaines  socialistes adhérentes.</i> This prompted Marx to write the 'Declaration of the General Council Concerning the Universal Federalist Council'. In September 1872 the Universal Federalist Council convened a congress in London which claimed to be a congress of the International Working Men's Association. Its subsequent activities amounted to in-fighting between the various cliques which laid claim to leadership of the workers' movement.</span>

The above-mentioned (third) trial of members of the Paris Federation of the International took place in Paris between 22 June and 5 July 1870. Legal proceedings were instituted against 38 members of the International Working Men's Association. In the course of the trial, the attempts by the Bonapartist authorities to accuse them of involvement in a plot to assassinate Napoleon III collapsed. Nevertheless, the accused were given prison sentences and fined.</span>

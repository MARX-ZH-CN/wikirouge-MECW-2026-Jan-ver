ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester,] 24 February 1858</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Enclosed a fiver<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> —unfortunately I couldn't shell out yesterday, otherwise you would have had it 24 hours earlier—and the article 'Brescia'. Now there are only 'Burmah' (half-finished—it's long job searching out the reports on the latest war<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> ) and 'Bomarsund' to be done for B, and after that the two biographies. As to these I can soon get together what is needed on 'Beresford', but I'm in a quandary with 'Bülow' because I find it absolutely impossible to get hold of a good book on the wars of liberation.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> His resolution at Grossbeeren (he beat the French against Bernadotte's wishes) is to be commended and the victory at Dennewitz was a most remarkable one: 40,000 Prussians beat 70,000 Frenchmen.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>However I shall have another look round. Once the stuff for B is finished I shall go on to 'Cavalry'.</p>
<p>I don't agree with the idea of dropping Appleton—unless that is, we have to go to the Continent. I find the encyclopaedic course most useful and, after all, the thing is going so slowly that it could be done entirely at one's leisure were financial circumstances not so pressing* Anyway you should threaten to resign as soon as the situation permits. I too believe that it would prove instantly beneficial.</p>
<p>In these circumstances the great Lassalle might be very useful. I trust he does what is necessary as regards the political economy, and likewise the Vienna <i>Presse.</i> He must have been very dilatory in the latter case, seeing that you had already written to him before about the financial article. I am keeping his letter here to show Lupus, since you've answered it anyway.</p>
<p>The historical irony whereby Mr Pam received his notice at the hands of Gibson and Bright is very pretty.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> What the <i>Guardian</i> has to say about it you will be able to see from the 3 copies I am sending off at the same time as this letter. Pam, by the way, evidendy intends to eliminate any possibility of his return—the prosecution of the wretched little publisher<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> in London, the witch hunt that ended in the cellar in Birmingham (see day before yesterday's <i>Sun,</i> A CAPITAL HOAX) and other gestures of subservience to Bonaparte that crop up every day cannot fail in the long run to infuriate John Bull.</p>
<p>In Italy the oudook can't be so very bad after all. Admittedly there are complaints about the delay in recovering outstanding debts but on the whole it's no worse than here in the HOME TRADE. We don't have very many more overdue accounts than is usually the case in Italy. Indeed the fellows are starting to order more freely again. Admittedly our own article can't be regarded as an absolute criterion, but it nevertheless provides a few pointers. Business is still <i>bad</i> over there, of course, but not exceedingly so. But all that can still come.</p>
<p>The Bonapartists must have become tremendously nervous. At Fould's <i>bal masqué</i> 75 <i>sergents de ville</i> <i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> </i> were ON THE PREMISES dressed as dominos. See the <i>Guardian.</i></p>
<p>Warmest regards to the whole FAMILY.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

Both battles took  place during the war of the Sixth Coalition (Russia, Austria, Prussia, Britain,  Spain, Sweden and other countries) against Napoleonic France. In the 1813  campaign Bernadotte commanded the allied Northern Army, which included  Bülow's corps.—164, 274</span>

<li id="cite_note-5"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-5">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">After Orsini's attempt on the life of Napoleon III, Count Walewski, Foreign  Minister of France, sent the British government a despatch on 20 January 1858  expressing his discontent at Britain's granting asylum to French political  refugees. The despatch served as a pretext for Palmerston to introduce a new  Aliens Bill, also called Conspiracy to Murder Bill (see Note 16), on 8 February  1858. According to this Bill, anyone living in the United Kingdom, an  Englishman or a foreigner, who took part in a conspiracy to murder a person  in Britain or any other country, was to be tried by an English court and  severely punished. During the second reading of the new Aliens Bill the  radicals Milner Gibson and John Bright, who had been defeated at the  parliamentary elections in March 1857, when the Whigs, Palmerston's  adherents, came to power, but were re-elected in the autumn of that year,  moved an amendment censuring Palmerston's government for failing to give a  fitting reply to Walewski's despatch. The House of Commons adopted the  amendment by a majority vote, rejected the Bill and compelled Palmerston's  government to resign.—273, 275</span>

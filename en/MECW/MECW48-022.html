ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE</p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>London, 6 April 1887</p>
<p>Dear Sorge,</p>
<p>Have received postcard together with the Dietzgen cutting, 24 March, and letter of 25 ditto. Hepner could hardly be in a position to judge from those few disconnected facts whether Aveling ought to have been 'more frank'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>I myself wouldn't venture to say so; all I know is that Aveling is as unfortunate in money matters as Hepner himself. Both have an enviable talent for getting mixed up in money squabbles through no fault of their own.</p>
<p>Whoever told you that Kautsky had become restive was either lying or had been lied to. I would trust Kautsky as I would trust myself; like most young men he is sometimes apt to be a bit opinionated, but if he harboured any doubts I would be the first to whom he would confide them. Anyway, I shall ask him this evening to what, if anything, the statement can refer.</p>
<p>Wilhelm,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>having first shrouded himself in silence, can now scarcely contain himself. He writes as follows (this between ourselves; please don't pass on the exact wording, but only as much of the contents as you think fit) (25 March):</p>
<p>'The New Yorkers will probably toe the line. I had already—weeks ago—written and told them in no uncertain terms that, no matter what the circumstances, I refused to allow myself to be played off against Aveling and Tussy. I have categorically <i>insisted upon a full apology</i> and, as I have said, I think they will comply. It's a great pity Aveling didn't write to me immediately after his return.'</p>
<p>(this is an empty excuse, since I had already informed him of the essentials round about 20 January,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>in so far as they were known to ourselves at the time)</p>
<p>—'it was from you I first learnt about the whole thing and by then we were in the midst of the electoral hurly-burly which, of course, claimed my whole attention. And so a lot of time was lost. But every- thing's bound to come out all right. If the New Yorkers dig their heels in, I shall <i>attack them publicly.</i> You can tell Aveling and Tussy so.'</p>
<p>On the whole the tide seems to be turning very much against the gentlemen of the Executive. Aveling has received sympathetic letters from several private quarters in New York; the American Rochester section has expressed its continuing confidence in him, the German Cleveland (or Buffalo? I forget) section has come out unanimously in his favour. And as much as a month ago the Executive—without waiting for the sections' votes—submitted all the files to the Board of Supervisors for a decision—i.e. appealed to another tribunal! We, of course, immedi- ately wrote to them as well, sending documents and insisting that they examine certain letters, etc.</p>
<p>You will have had a copy of Aveling's reply to the second and, indeed, even more infamous article in the <i>Volkszeitung.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Our Parisians have again got themselves into a fix. They had lost the <i>Cri du Peuple,</i> and now the <i>Socialiste</i> has also died for want of funds. The Paris working men have so spoilt their digestions with 50 years of sectarian and phrase-mongering socialism that they cannot at present stomach wholesome fare. <i>Paris, le centre des lumières, la ville de l'idée, est dégoûté d'idées.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In Russia, on the other hand, a crisis would seem imminent. The recent assassination attempts<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>were just about the last straw, every- thing's at sixes and sevens and, furthermore—circumstances being what they are in Russia—compulsory military service has ruined the Russian army. This was inevitable. As I myself pointed out as much as ten years ago.</p>
<p>Kindest regards,</p>
<p>Your Engels

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">On 25 March 1887 Sorge informed Engels that Hepner had openly protested against the accusations levelled at Aveling (see note 3), describing them as 'insidious and mean', but saying that the whole thing could have been avoided had Aveling been 'more frank'. Sorge also said that according to his information Kautsky did not know what to make of the matter and Liebknecht kept silent.</span>

To this second article Aveling answered by a letter dated 16 March 1887, mentioned here, which, as the rough copy shows, had been written by Engels. It was published on 30 March, in Issue 76.</span>

ENGELS TO MARX<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 18 October 1867</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>I have written to Borkheim that I cannot accept in any circumstances and that now that I have guaranteed him the amount, it all depends on <i>his</i> sources of credit, as mine are tied up.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The letters returned enclosed. Liebknecht appears to have been SICK, or else he could surely have said something about the combination law. PERHAPS IT IS BETTER SO. Schweitzer has shown himself to be a vain jackass and phrasemonger. He's finished now.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>I was much amused by the Beta correspondence.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <i>Courrier français</i> has arrived, but I have no time whatsoever to form an opinion of it today.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>I could write another 4-5 articles about your book<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>from various points of view, but don't know where to place them. Goodness knows where Siebel is! Maybe in Algiers or in Palermo! But I hope to have an answer from him soon. If I could have them copied in London, so that my handwriting would not be recognised, it might after all be wisest to send them to Meissner.</p>
<p>Kindest regards to all.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

Although he did support the bill, he held a Lassallean stance denying the importance of strikes and coalitions in the workers' struggle against capitalist exploitation. He also made an attempt to expound some tenets of Marx's political economy but he did so in a primitive and distorted way. A report on Schweitzer's speech was published in <i>Der Social-Demokrat,</i> Nos. 122 and 123 of 16 and 18 October 1867.</span>

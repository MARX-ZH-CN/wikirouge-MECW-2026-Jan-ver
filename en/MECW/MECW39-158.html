To Engels in Manchester</p>
<p>[London,] 27 April 1853<br>
28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>I have just been with Freiligrath to see Gerstenberg and there is some prospect of having the bill discounted by Friday or at least of obtaining an advance on it. No go with Strohn, OF COURSE. So there is still a possibility of coming to you—which I greatly wish to do.</p>
<p>I should be obliged if you would answer by return the following enquiry little Bamberger asked me to pass on to you (the fellow might come in useful now or at any time):</p>
<p>Madapolams for the Italian market } Good houses to<br>
Printed calicos ditto &gt; buy from in<br>
Straw manufacturing houses ditto } Manchester</p>
<p>Received the article and £1 for Pieper and Dronke.</p>
<p>I know now for certain that my information about Mazzini's presence in London<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>was correct.</p>
<p>Hirsch was at the Russian consul's the day before yesterday, and on the same day at Fleury's house with Stieber and Goldheim.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

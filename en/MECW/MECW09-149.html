<p>To the Royal Oberpräsident,</p>
<p>His Honour Herr Eichmann,</p>
<p>at Coblenz</p>
<p>In response to the courteous communication of 29th ult. from</p>
<p>Your Honour regarding the expulsion of Dr. Carl Marx, I have today dispatched the instructions to the Royal Government Authorities in Cologne, a copy of which I enclosed herewith for your information.</p>
<p>At the same time I grant Your Honour full discretion to issue the appropriate instructions to the said Government Authorities concerning those points which you most particularly wish to see observed in case of the expulsion of the aforesaid Marx.</p>
<p>Berlin, April 7, 1849</p>
<p>The Minister of the Interior</p>

</center><p>To the Royal Government Authorities at Cologne</p>
<p>Consequent upon the report of 10th ult.,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>for which the supporting documents are returned enclosed, I would reply to the Royal Government Authorities that I for my part see no objection to the proposed expulsion of Dr. Carl Marx, who is no longer a subject of this polity. The Royal Government Authorities however need no special authorisation to this end; indeed it must be left to the latter to judge whether there is sufficient cause for such a step. It would seem desirable, it is true, to proceed with the expulsion of the aforesaid Marx on the direct occasion of a specific, unequivocal offence on his part; however, such an occasion is unlikely to be wanting, since, as I am informed, he has very recently once again evoked grave suspicion of treasonable activities endangering the state.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Accordingly I simply leave the decision as to further action to the discretion of the Royal Government Authorities, and look forward to receiving a fuller account of the issue of the affair in due course.</p>
<p>Berlin, April 7, 1849</p>

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">This refers to the attempt by the Minister of the Interior, Manteuffel, to implicate Marx, Engels and their associates in the case against cobbler Hatzel, a member of the Communist League, at whose house in Berlin the Rules of the League, weapons and hand grenades had been found. On March 30, 1848, Manteuffel sent a secret police agent to Cologne to carry out house searches, seize papers and, using the evidence thus obtained, arrest the Cologne leaders of the Communist League. However, this police action misfired owing to lack of evidence.</span>

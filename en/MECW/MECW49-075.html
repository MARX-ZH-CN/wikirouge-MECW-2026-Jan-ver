<p>Dear Kautsky,</p>
<p>Many thanks for your two letters.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I return herewith those of Bebel and Schippel.</p>
<p>The boycott imposed upon me by the Berliners has not yet been lifted; there's been no sign of a letter and it's obvious they haven't yet made up their minds. By contrast, the <i>Hamburger Echo</i> published a leading article that was very fair,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> considering that the chaps are still strongly tainted with Lassalleanism and actually swear by the system of acquired rights.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> From this, and from the <i>Frankfurter Zeitung</i>, I also gathered that the onslaught of the opposition press was already at its height, if not actually abating. Once they have survived that—and so far as I could see, it has so far been very mild—the chaps will recover from their initial alarm. By contrast, Adler's Berlin correspondent (A. Braun?) has actually thanked me for publishing the thing.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> A few more such voices and the opposition will languish.</p>
<p>It became evident to me that the document had been deliberately suppressed and concealed from Bebel in May/June 1875 the moment he informed me that the date of his release from prison had been 1 April; indeed, I have written to him<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> saying that he was bound to have seen it unless 'something untoward' had happened. In due course I shall, if necessary, request him to reply to this point. For a long time the document was held by Liebknecht from whose clutches Bracke had some difficulty in retrieving it; Liebknecht wished to keep it entirely to himself in order to use it for the final version of the programme. How, needs no saying.</p>
<p>Send me Lafargue's article<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> by registered book post as a ms.; I'll smooth things out all right. Come to that, his article on Padlewski<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> was quite good and very useful, considering the way the <i>Vorwärts</i> misrepresents French politics. All in all, Wilhelm<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> would seem to be out of luck in this respect. <i>He</i> is always praising the French Republic to the skies while Guesde, the correspondent whom he himself appointed, is for ever tearing it to pieces.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The parliamentary group's pronouncement,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> heralded by Schippel, is a matter of complete indifference to me. Should they wish, I am prepared to confirm that I am not in the habit of asking their permission. Whether or not they approve of the fact of publication is all one to me. Nor do I begrudge them the right to express their disapproval of this and that. Unless the affair turns out in such a way as absolutely to compel me to take it up, it would not occur to me to reply. So we shall wait and see.</p>
<p>I shall not write to Bebel about it, for in the first place he himself must first let me know what view of the matter he has finally arrived at and, in the second, every resolution is signed by everybody in the parliamentary group whether or not they voted for it. By the way, Bebel is wrong in thinking I would allow myself to become embroiled in acrimonious dispute. For that to happen, they would first have to provoke me with falsehoods, etc., which I could not overlook. On the contrary, I am positively steeped in a spirit of conciliation, having after all no cause for anger, and am only too anxious to build that bridge—pontoon bridge, trestle bridge, iron, stone or even golden bridge—across the potential abyss or gulf which Bebel thought he saw yawning in the distance.</p>
<p>Odd! Schippel now writes of the many old Lassalleans who pride themselves on their Lassalleanism—yet when they were over here,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> it was unanimously agreed that there were no Lassalleans left in Germany! Indeed, this was the main reason for my abandoning many of my reservations. And then Bebel also chimes in, saying that a large number of the best comrades are seriously offended. If [so],<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> they ought to have [described]<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> things to me as they really were.</p>
<p>Come to that, if you cannot now, 15 years later, speak your mind about Lassalle's theoretical balderdash and his prophetic mission, when if ever will you be able to?</p>
<p>However, the party as such, the Executive, the parliamentary group and <i>tutti quanti</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup> are exempted by the Anti-Socialist Law<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup> from all blame save that of having accepted such a programme (and there is no getting round this). So long as that law was in force there could be no question of any revision; no sooner was it suspended than revision was included in the agenda. So what more do they want?</p>
<p>It is also imperative that the chaps should at long last throw off the habit of handling the party officials—their servants—with kid gloves and kow-towing to them as infallible bureaucrats, instead of confronting them critically.</p>
<p>Your<br>F. E.</p>
<p>You will no doubt have heard that Aveling is standing for Northampton in place of Bradlaugh.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup> The invitation came from the local branches of the Social Democratic Federation<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup> and from the Gasworkers. He went down there and his tub-thumping met with great applause. He was assured of 900-1,000 votes. But he hadn't got the deposit for the election expenses and, when offered this by a Tory agent, indignantly refused it. Thus he was not nominated, but from now on will stand as labour candidate for Northampton.</p>

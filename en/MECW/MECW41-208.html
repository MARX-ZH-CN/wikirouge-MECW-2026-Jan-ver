<br><i>To Engels in Manchester</i>
<br><b>[London,] 15 March 1862</b>
<br>Dear Engels,
<br>Because your article failed to arrive, I have been unable to write to New York today. My relations with the <em>Tribune</em> are no longer such that, if (assuming they print the article) I send them <b>something else</b> in place of the sequel, they will print it. Rather, I am convinced that they are on the point of giving me my <em>congé</em> again along with all the other European correspondents. Their format has been reduced. They print perhaps one article in 3 or none at all. These are the usual indications of such a procedure.
<br>So, let me have the sequel by Tuesday or better still, the conclusion, since it is only the conjectural part relating to the future that can be of any real interest to them.
<br>I'm not getting on very well with my book [the second instalment of <em>Critique of Political Economy</em>], since work is often checked, i.e. suspended, for weeks on end by domestic disturbances. Little Jenny is still by no means as well as she should be.
<br><em>Salut</em>.
<br>Your<br>K. M.

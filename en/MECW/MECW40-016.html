MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 8 May<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>1856</p>
<p>28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>DEAR Frederic,</p>
<p>Received your letter.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>My PRESSURE u p o n you in YESTERDAY'S LETTER explicable <i>d'abord<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></i> by the fact that an earlier parcel of my wife's</p>
<p>did <i>not</i> arrive in Manchester, although sent by post. Secondly, however, you know how a man feels when he's kept on the hop by piles. <i>And such a man am I.</i></p>
<p>I am glad to hear that you and Lupus are entirely of my opinion with regard to Miquel's letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>—the attempt to digest this 'wisdom' fairly 'turned my stomach'.</p>
<p>Unless something goes wrong with the pecuniary arrangements I have made, my family will be leaving in 10 to 14 days at the latest.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>A pity you are so overworked, otherwise we might have done <i>un petit tour<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></i> to Scodand.</p>
<p>1 shall carry out your commissions at die Museum<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>as soon as I go there again.</p>
<p>Enclosed: 2 letters, 1. from Imandt; 2. from Cologne.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>Would it not be best if I replied to the Cologne people through my wife? THERE EXISTS SOME JEALOUSY between Cologne and Düsseldorf AS TO THE LEADING OF THE PROLETARIAN MOVEMENT. BESIDES, I don't know whether the Cologne people are aware that the Düsseldorfers have completely broken with Lassalle who has fallen into general disrepute among them.</p>
<p>Yesterday the following comical missive arrived from Sheffield:</p>
<p>»Council Hall, Sheffield, Doctor, May 6th, '56. The Sheffield Foreign Affairs Committee instructs me to convey to you an expression of their warm thanks for the great public service you have rendered by your admirable <i>exposé</i> of the Kars Papers published in <i>The People's Paper<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>.</i> I have the Honour etc.</p>
<p><i>Cyples,</i> Secretary.*</p>
<p>That is magnanimous, there being war to the death between <i>The People's Paper</i> and <i>The Free Press,</i> as between Chartism and Urquhartism generally.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>The great Ironside went one step further and decreed THAT THE THANKS OF THE COUNTRV WERE DUE TO DR. M. ETC. It would have been much better had the chaps sent me the money they made out by reprinting the Palmerston articles under the title <i>Story of the Life etc.</i> (in pamphlet form).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>From New York Seiler has sent me—came today—'Das Recht deutscher vereinigter Staatenbürger in Europa' in the <i>Democrat<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup>.</i></p>
<p>Will never be read, not in this world at any rate.</p>
<p>Since handing over your £2 to Pieper I haven't set eyes on him. Moreover, Jones has sent word that, up till <i>yesterday evening,</i> he had not delivered the work he had accepted for <i>The People's Paper.</i></p>
<p><i>Nous verrons.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup></i> If he wilfully throws away this opportunity as well, let him go to the devil. Now's his chance, the silly ass.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>Apropos! Have seen Heine's will<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup>! A return to the 'living God', and a 'Recantation before God and man' if ever he wrote anything 'immoral'!</p>
<p>Didn't see Colonel Touroute again before he left for Germany. Enclosed letters <i>not</i> to be returned. Regards to Lupus.

Miquel's own statements on this question testified to a retreat from the consistendy revolutionary standpoint. He limited the tasks of the revolution to establishing a united centralised state and ignored the need for social change. He maintained that the proletariat should ally itself not only with the petty-bourgeois democrats but also with the bourgeois liberals and refrain from such revolutionary measures as might frighten the bourgeoisie away from the revolution. No answer by Marx to Miquel is extant.—42, 44</span>

<li id="cite_note-10"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-10">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Marx means the polemics between the Chartists and the Urquhartites, which had been exacerbated by the publication in Urquhart's<i> Free Press</i> (19 January 1856) of 'The Chartist Correspondence' (see Note 9). The Urquhartites' hostility towards the revolutionary trend in the British working-class movement found expression in attempts to represent the Chartists as demagogues and agents of the Russian Tsar. The Chartists, for their part, described the Urquhartites as reactionaries advocating a restoration of the customs and practices of the Middle Ages. A sharp controversy developed, in particular, over the future of Parliament. The Chartists held that it should be reformed on democratic principles and used as an instrument of social change, whereas the Urquhartites advocated total abolition of the representative system and a return to patriarchal forms of government.—32, 44</span>

This was a reproduction of the series as published under the same title between December 1855 and February 1856 in several issues of<i> The Free Press,</i> the Urquhartites' London paper.

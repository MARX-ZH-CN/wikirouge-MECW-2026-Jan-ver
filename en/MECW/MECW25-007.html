<h4 class="mw-headline" id="Outline_of_the_General_Plan">Outline of the General Plan</h4>
<p>This plan was compiled after June 1878 – since it mentions the old preface to (<i>Anti</i>]<i>-Duhring</i> written in May-June 1878, and a pamphlet by Haeckel entitled, <i>Freie Wissenschalt und freie Lehre</i> (<i>Free Science and Free Teaching</i>), published in June 1878-and before 1880, since there is no mention in it of such chapters of <i>Dialectics of Nature</i> as "Basic Forms of Motion," "Heat," and "Electricity," which were written in 1880-82. A comparison of the reference to the German bourgeois Darwinists Haeckel and Schmidt contained in point 11 of this plan with Engels's letter to Lavrov dated August 10, 1878, gives grounds for assuming that the present outline was written in August 1878.</p>
<p>(1) Historical introduction: the metaphysical outlook has become impossible in natural science owing to the very development of the latter.</p>
<p>(2) Course of the theoretical development in Germany since Hegel (old preface).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> The return to dialectics takes place unconsciously, hence contradictorily and slowly.</p>
<p>(3) Dialectics as the science of universal inter-connection. Main laws: transformation of quantity and quality – mutual penetration of polar opposites and transformation into each other when carried to extremes-development through contradiction or negation of the negation – spiral form of development.</p>
<p>(4) The inter- connection of the sciences. Mathematics, mechanics, physics, chemistry, biology. St. Simon (Comte), and Hegel.</p>
<p>
(5) Apercus [reflections, remarks) on the separate sciences and their dialectical content:</p><blockquote><p>1. Mathematics: dialectical aids and expressions. Mathematical infinite really occurring.</p>
<p>2. Celestial mechanics-now resolved into a process. - Mechanics: point of departure was inertia, which is only the negative expression of the indestructibility of motion.</p>
<p>3. Physics-transitions of molecular motions into one another. Clausius and Loschmidt.</p>
<p>4. Chemistry: theories, energy.</p>
<p>
5. Biology. Darwinism. Necessity and chance.</p></blockquote><p>(6) The limits of knowledge. Du-Bois-Reymond and Nägeli.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> -Helmholtz, Kant, Hume.</p>
<p>(7) The mechanical theory. Haeckel.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>(8) The plastidule soul - Haeckel and Nägeli.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>(9) Science and teaching - Virchow.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>(10) The cell state - Virchow.</p>
<p>(11) Darwinian politics and theory of society - Haeckel and Schmidt.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> - Differentiation of man through labour. - Application of economics to natural science. Helmholtz's "work" (<i>Populäre Vortrage</i>, II).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> </p>
<h4 class="mw-headline" id="Outline_of_Part_of_the_Plan">Outline of Part of the Plan</h4>
<p>This outline is fundamentally a plan for the chapter "Basic Forms of Motion." On the other hand, there is a whole group of chapters – interconnected as to subject and period – that correspond to it, namely, "Basic Forms of Motion," "The Measure of Motion. Work," "Tidal Friction," "Heat" and "Electricity." All these chapters were written between 1880 and 1882. The outline was written earlier – probably in 1880.</p>
<p>(1) Motion in general. of motion.</p>
<p>(2) Attraction and repulsion. Transference</p>
<p>(3) [Law of the] conservation of energy applied to this.</p>
<p>Repulsion + attraction. – Addition of repulsion = energy.</p>
<p>(4) Gravitation - heavenly bodies - terrestrial mechanics.</p>
<p>(5) Physics. Heat. Electricity,</p>
<p>(6) Chemistry.</p>
<p>
(7) Summary.</p><blockquote><p>(a) Before 4: Mathematics. Infinite line. + and - are equal.
(b) In astronomy: performance of work by the tides. Double calculation in Helmholtz, II, p. 120. "Forces" in Helmholtz, II, p. 190.</p></blockquote>

Haeckel, Nägeli and Virchow, who addressed the Congress plenary meetings on September 18, 20 and 22, dealt with the problem at considerable length. Haeckel devoted one chapter in his pamphlet <i>Freie Wissenschaft und freie Lehre</i> (<i>Free Science</i> and <i>Free Teaching</i>) to the defence of his views on the matter against Virchow's attacks.</span>

<li id="cite_note-6"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-6">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">In July-August 1878 Engels proposed to criticise bourgeois Darwinists attacking socialism. The idea was prompted by the news that Oskar Schmidt was going to read a paper entitled "Darwinismus und Socialdemocratie" ("Darwinism and Social-Democracy") at the 51st Congress of German Natural Scientists and Physicians in Kassel (September 1878). Engels read the news in the magazine <i>Nature</i> of July 18, 1878 (Vol. XVIII, No. 455, p. 316). After the Congress Schmidt's paper was published in pamphlet form (Oskar Schmidt, <i>Darwinismus und Socialdemocratie,</i> Bonn, 1878). About August 10, 1878, Engels received Haeckel's pamphlet <i>Freie Wissenschaft und freie Lehre</i> (Stuttgart, 1878), which tried to exonerate Darwinism from the accusation of being linked with the socialist movement and quoted some of Schmidt's statements. He wrote to Schmidt on July 19 and to Lavrov on August 10, 1878, telling them of his intention to answer those statements.</span>

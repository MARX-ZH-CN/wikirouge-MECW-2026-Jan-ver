ENGELS TO PATRICK JOHN COLEMAN<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 20 May 1875</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>As to your own business, I am sorry I am not in position to become security for <i>anybody.</i> I have done it once and the experience I made then has been such that I shall never repeat the act. If it was in my power to assist you in any other way I should be glad to do it, but at present I do not see any possibility of being useful to you.</p>
<p>[Engels' later note, in German, on the envelope of Coleman's letter]</p>
<p>Coleman, [18]75. McDonnell's International.

ENGELS TO WILLIAM BURRS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London,] 22 February 1872</p>
<p>In reply...<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I beg to say that Mr Glaser<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> has been highly recommended to me and that I believe him to be a strictly honourable man and not without some means, and who is not likely to enter into engagements he could not fulfil so that, if I were in a position to do business with him, I should not hesitate to trust him to a moderate amount say £100 to 200.

The former letter, as well as Engels' draft letters to J. Molesworth (written after 5 June) and to Th. Smart &amp; Co. (3 July), are replies to enquiries by the relevant companies regarding E. Glaser de Willebrord's solvency and his reliability as a potential partner (see this volume, pp. 391 and 406).</span>

MARX TO FRANZ DUNCKER</p>
<p>IN BERLIN</p>
<p>London, 2 June 1859</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I am indeed very sorry if I wrote you an offensive letter.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Please allow me, therefore, to say a few words in extenuation. To begin with I have in fact been away from Germany for too long and have grown too accustomed to conditions in London to form a correct estimate of the way business is conducted in Germany. Secondly, as I informed Lassalle some two months ago,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I am engaged in negotiations with a London publisher with regard to an English rendering of the first instalment.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> The constantly misleading information which I, constantly labouring as I was</p>
<p>u n d e r a false assumption, have been forced to give this man regarding the appearance of the book, has more than sufficed to show me u p as a REGULAR HUMBUG in the eyes of the aforesaid John Bull. T h e repeated and impatient inquiries of my friends and in the end, the r u m o u r that the thing will not be coming out at all—a r u m o u r carefully disseminated, out of what motives I cannot say, by a Berlin clique <i>here</i>—finally proved too much for my patience.</p>
<p>Lastly, I trust that, in consideration of these reasons, you will regard my letter merely as the hasty expression of an irritability aroused by all manner of circumstances and absolve me of any intention of wishing to give offence.</p>
<p>Yours very faithfully,</p>
<p>Dr K. Marx

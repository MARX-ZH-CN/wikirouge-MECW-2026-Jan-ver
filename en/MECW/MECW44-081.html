ENGELS TO FRANCISCO MORA 1 9 5</p>
<p>IN MADRID</p>
<p>[Résumé of a letter]</p>
<p>[London, around 20 April 1871]</p>
<p>On 19 April the relevant extracts from Nos. 80-92 of the <i>Federation</i> about the SPINNERS' STRIKE in Barcelona<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>sent to Eccarius who was to report on it to the Manchester TRADE COUNCIL.</p>
<p>Wrote ditto to Mora, acknowledging receipt and reporting what had happened, pointing out that little help would be forthcoming because of the Belgian and Sunderland STRIKES and the general world situation.</p>
<p>The loan an essential instrument and the one we have mainly used up to now. Therefore the Barcelonese must write a letter binding themselves to repay all loan-monies received through the agency of the General Council. This only necessary to comply with the formalities of the English TRADE UNIONS.</p>
<p>Promise a copy of the Address on Paris.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>

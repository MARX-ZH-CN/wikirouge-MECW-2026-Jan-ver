ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 6 March 1865</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Yours of the day before yesterday received, as was the <i>Social-Demokrat</i> today containing that droll article excommunicating us.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> It really makes one laugh.</p>
<p>I have been at home with 'flu most of today, but I shall go and see the lawyer about the Lupus affair<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> as soon as possible. Everything will be straight as soon as the fellow completes; Borchardt has been paid his £100 (i.e. less the money he has already had), and the Schiller Institute also its £100, too; furthermore, I gave the lawyer approx. £150 to cover tax and am only waiting for his account now before remitting the rest to you directly. I shall put together a provisional balance sheet for you in a day or two so that you can see how things stand.</p>
<p>Things from Siebel and a certain Lange enclosed. <i>Qu'en penses-tu?</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Send the stuff back, as well as the letter from <i>Meissner,</i> which I must have for my correspondence with him. I am sending him the cuttings for him to see that we have also got people to push things along.</p>
<p>The <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i> has also printed our statement,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> but only up to the words that the <i>Social-Demokrat's</i> tactics preclude our further participation in it.</p>
<p>Bruhn returned enclosed. How THE HELL CAME YOU TO OWE THAT FELLOW ANY BRASS?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> However much it is, I shall send it to you at once.</p>
<p>2 COPIES of the pamphlet<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> despatched herewith. They are the last ones. But I have ordered some more. There is an announcement about the pamphlet in the <i>Kölner Zeitung.</i></p>
<p>What kind of 'PAPERS from the Manchester <i>press</i> relating to the COTTON-CRISIS' are you talking about? Surely you mean from the RELIEF COMMITTEE<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> ? I have not seen Maclure for some time; as soon as I encounter him, I shall have a word with him about it.</p>
<p>Gumpert does not think much of Kugelmann's phosphate of lime. At all events, it is not a specific remedy. He says you ought to take arsenic. Returned enclosed.</p>
<p>I must now go to the Schiller Institute to chair the <i>Comité.</i> By the by, one of the fellows there, a chemist,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> has recently explained Tyndall's experiment with sunlight<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> to me. It is really capital.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

It said that the German Social-Democrats who were not members of the General Association of German Workers did not belong to the Social-Democratic Party. By this attack on Marx, Engels and their close associates in Germany, the editors of <i>Der Social-Demokrat</i> sought to weaken the impression of Marx and Engels' statement on their breach with the newspaper.

<li id="cite_note-7"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-7">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">In April 1863 the British Parliament passed the <i>Public Works Act</i> in view of the reduced production and mass unemployment in the cotton districts of England. This Act provided the municipal authorities of these districts with funds to pay the unemployed temporarily used for public works, mainly on laying the sewerage system, building roads, etc. The Relief Committees, which guarded the interests of the capitalists, were in charge of organising these works and paying the workers. The unemployed were forced to agree to hard labour for miserable pay.
The <i>ateliers nationaux</i> (national workshops) were instituted by the French Provisional Government immediately after the February revolution of 1848. By this means the government sought to discredit Louis Blanc's ideas on 'the organisation of labour' in the eyes of the workers and, at the same time, to utilise those employed in the national workshops, organised on military lines, against the revolutionary proletariat. Revolutionary ideas, however, continued to gain ground in the national workshops. The government took steps to reduce the number of workers employed in them, to send a large number off to public works in the provinces and finally to liquidate the workshops. This precipitated a proletarian uprising in Paris in June 1848. After its suppression, the Cavaignac government issued a decree on 3 July, disbanding the national workshops.</span>

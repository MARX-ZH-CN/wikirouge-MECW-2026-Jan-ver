ENGELS TO E. J. FAULKNER
<br>IN MANCHESTER
<br>[Draft]
<br>Manchester, 2 November 1859
<br>Dear Faulkner,
<br>Will something like the enclosed do? I shall call here again before 7 o'clock.
<br>Yours
<br>F. E.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>Mr Daniells Sir,
<br>After what happened between you and me on a certain evening,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I should have been the first to make to you that apology which one Gentleman owed to another under the circumstances, if you had not at once taken such steps as precluded me entirely from doing so. Indeed I at once requested a friend of mine to call upon you for the purpose but when he arrived it was too late. If Mrs Daniells as I hear feels aggrieved at anything I may have said, I should be very sorry not to withdraw most emphatically any expression which may have given umbrage to a lady whom I have not the honour of knowing and upon whose character it could
<br>therefore never enter into my intention to cast the slightest imputation.
<br>As to the other matter between you and me, I am only sorry that it ever should have occurred and am prepared to pay to you £30.—in the shape of compensation.
<br>I am Sir
<br>Your obedient servant

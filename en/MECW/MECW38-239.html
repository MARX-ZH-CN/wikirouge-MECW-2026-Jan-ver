To Joseph Weydemeyer in New York</p>
<p>[London,] 19 December 1851</p>
<p>28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>DEAR Weydemeyer,</p>
<p>The day before yesterday I received your letter, sent on to me by Engels.</p>
<p>First, my best New Year wishes to your wife<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>and yourself. Ditto from my wife.</p>
<p>I am at this moment sitting here working on an article for you. Your commission arrived too late for me to be able to carry it out today. On Tuesday (23 December) the following will go off to you</p>
<p>1. <i>Der 18te Brumaire des Louis Bonaparte</i> by K. Marx. 2. <i>Der Staatsstreich in Frankreich</i> by F. Wolff. 3. <i>Nemesis</i> by Wilhelm Wolff. <i>Engels</i> will send you his article—on Prussia, I believe—possibly even by today's mail. <i>Freiligrath</i> has nothing ready but authorises you to name him as one of your collaborators. We are negotiating with <i>Weerth</i>. Likewise with <i>Eccarius</i>.</p>
<p>You can now settle down in the United States for <i>du moins</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>a year. <i>It</i> is not going to begin on 2 May 1852.</p>
<p>I suppose that you will hold back your first number<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>until the above articles arrive. After all, it will only make a difference of 5 days. For the following numbers you can announce a serialised work of mine, to appear article by article, namely, <i>Neueste Offenbarungen des Sozialismus, oder 'Idée générale de la Révolution au XIX<sup>e</sup> siècle' par J. P. Proudhon.—Kritik von K.M.</i></p>
<p>Write forthwith to 'Adolf Cluss, U.S. Navy Yard, Washington D.C.' We've already told him you are coming.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>He is one of our best and most talented men and could be of the greatest use to you both generally and for the preparation and founding of your paper in particular.</p>
<p>Don't forget the following:</p>
<p>Go and see Dana; ask him to give you the numbers of the <i>Tribune</i> in which my articles appeared,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>and send them to me <i>forthwith</i>. Hearing nothing from him, I had stopped writing, and there's been such a long interval that I must see the paper itself in order to write the sequel, which I must do, if only for pecuniary reasons.</p>
<p>As soon as your paper appears you must not only send it to us regularly, but let us have a sufficient number of copies so that we can send them out as samples.</p>
<p><i>Tout a toi</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>K. Marx</p>
<p><br>
Unless you are contractually committed, don't buy the <i>Arbeiterrepublik</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>from the wretched Weitling. While you might gain 200 Straubingers,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>you would lose a wider readership. Write only under the old name. <i>Règle générale.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup></p>

Marx and Engels agreed to contribute regularly and intended to get some of their party friends to work for it. Weydemeyer managed to produce only two issues in January 1852, following which publication ceased for lack of funds. In May and June 1852 with the help of Adolph Cluss, Weydemeyer published two more issues of the 'non-periodic journal' <i>Die Revolution</i>; the first issue carried K. Marx's <i>The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte</i>, the second Freiligrath's poems against Kinkel.</span>

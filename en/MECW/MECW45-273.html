ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN RAMSGATE
<br>London, 11 September 1879
<br>Dear Moor,
<br>Letters received.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Yesterday Hirsch called at my house where he also encountered the Lafargues and Henry Juta; he is going to bring me the stuff I had returned to him earlier on, and then I shall set to work forthwith.
<br>Laura and Paul, i.e. notably the latter, said they would be coming again next Sunday evening<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> . Much though we appreciate this, it is a matter that calls for careful consideration on account of Tussy. Since our return, she has been dining with us on Sundays and I shall, needless to say, invite her for next Sunday as well. As Paul had said the Longuets would be returning this week, I had thought of going to see Jenny tomorrow or the day after and asking her to help me out of this quandary by taking over Tussy for the <i>evening.</i> But on leaving, Laura said that Jenny wouldn't be back till <i>Saturday,</i> and so I have no other recourse than to contrive things in this way. If it's feasible, let me know at once; if not, some other way out must be found. The Lafargues never arrive <i>before 7 o'clock.</i>
<br>Kindest regards. For three days now Jollymeier has been much better—Buxton probably not necessary.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <br>Your
<br>F. E.

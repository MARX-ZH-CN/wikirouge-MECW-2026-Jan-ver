<br><i>To Engels in Manchester</i>
<br><b>[London,] 11 January [1858]</b>
<br>Dear Frederick,
<br>'Campaign', etc. received. In the next day or so I shall go to the Museum to look up the matters in question.
<br>Affairs in India — with Windham for <b>hero —</b> are again taking an interesting <b>turn</b>. If we have fuller particulars this week, by Wednesday or thereabouts, I shall have to send off something on the subject to the <em>Tribune</em>.
<br>In elaborating the <b>principles</b> of economics I have been so damnably held up by errors in calculation that in <b>despair</b> I have applied myself to a rapid revision of algebra., I have never felt at home with arithmetic. But by making a detour via algebra, I shall quickly get back into the way of things.
<br>Your health bulletins are too cursory. I'd like you to go into more detail, <b>for instance</b>, have all your sores healed up?
<br>More in my, next.
<br>Your<br>K. M.
<br>I hunted through Clausewitz, more or less, when doing Blücher. The fellow possesses a <b>common sense</b> bordering on the ingenious.

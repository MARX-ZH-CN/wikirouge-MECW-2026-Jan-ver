MARX TO SIGMUND SCHOTT</p>
<p>IN FRANKFURT AM MAIN</p>
<p>[London,] 13 July 1878</p>
<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>Having had no word whatsoever from Germany, I should particularly like to know whether you got the letter.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>I wrote you immediately on receipt of yours.</p>
<p>I don't even get newspapers if they are addressed to me in my name.</p>
<p>If you have not received my letter, perhaps you would be good enough to write in future (without further particulars as to the addressee) to Edwin Willis, Esq., 40 Maitland Park Crescent, London, N. W.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>K. M.

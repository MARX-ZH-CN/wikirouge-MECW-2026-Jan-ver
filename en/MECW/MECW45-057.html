MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN RAMSGATE</p>
<p>Karlsbad, 8 September 1875 Germania</p>
<p>Dear FRED,</p>
<p>You will doubtless have already heard from Tussy that my first letter to her, which I handed in personally at the main post office here on 18 August in the presence of Dr Gans junior, has been intercepted, doubtless by the Prussian postal authorities. The subsequent ones have arrived; the latest, which I sent her last week, appears to have shared the fate of the first, for I should otherwise surely have had an answer from her.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>This time I'm really getting on splendidly with the cure; with rare exceptions good nights, too. But I am also, or so my</p>
<p>numerous doctor friends say, Karlsbad's model guest. From time to time these gentlemen have been at pains to lead me away from the path of 'salvation'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> on the pretext <i>praesente medico</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> etc., but their attempts have failed.</p>
<p>As a second-year patient I have been promoted in the hierarchy of the springs. Last year my sources of supply were Theresien- brunn (41° R), Marktbrunn (39°) and Mühlbrunn (43.6°), while I only took a glass of Sprudel twice. This year, from the second week on, they have been Felsenquelle (one glass a day) (45° R), Bernardsbrunn (53.8°) (two glasses) and Sprudel (two glasses) 59°-60° R, making five glasses of hot every morning, on top of which come one cold Schlossbrunn on rising and one at bedtime.</p>
<p>According to Prof. Ferdinand Ragsky's analysis, Sprudel water consists of:</p>

<p>Among the fellows calling for the celebration of Sedan Day<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>here was a businessman from Barmen, Gustav Köttgen—might he be connected with the old fool<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> ?</p>
<p>You had better watch out: Karl Grün is competing with you. He is bringing out a work on natural philosophy next spring and has already given a foretaste of it in the Berlin <i>Wage</i> which Weiss has sent me from Berlin.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> </p>
<p>I shall be leaving here on Saturday,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> initially for Prague, having got a letter from there today from Oppenheim.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> From Prague I shall proceed via Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Dr Fleckles has just arrived and is taking me out for a meal. So my long letter has come to naught; moreover Dr Fleckles says it is unsuited to the cure. Kindest regards to Madame Lizzy.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Moor

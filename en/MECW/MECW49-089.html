ENGELS TO MAX OPPENHEIM</p>
<p>IN DRESDEN</p>
<p>London, 24 March 1891
122 Regent's
Park Road,
N.W.</p>
<p>Dear Mr Oppenheim,</p>
<p>First of all I must crave your forgiveness for not having answered your esteemed letter of 26 November until now — almost four months later to the day! But if you knew what an unending mass of work and correspondence of all kinds I have had during that time and that, moreover, I am not allowed to wield my pen for more than 3 hours daily because of my weak eyes — and by daylight at that!—you would, I am sure, excuse me.</p>
<p>My heartfelt thanks then for your kind good wishes which would appear to be coming true in as much as I am on the whole very well, all things considered, and everyone alleges that I do not look my age. Let us hope that I so continue.</p>
<p>You further touch on a few difficult themes which cannot be dealt with anything like exhaustively in a short letter. Certainly, it would spell progress if workers' unions could negotiate wage settlements
</p>

ENGELS TO GOTTFRIED ERMEN
<br>IN MANCHESTER
<br><i>Copy</i> Manchester, 19 April 1860
<br>Sir,
<br>I have no hesitation in expressing my regret that you should have taken offence at my taking home the book of calculations during dinner-time. As books have been taken home, before, by others connected with the office, I did not expect it would have caused you any annoyance. As to any intentions on my part of taking any undue advantage, you are aware that the whole of the calculations contained in the said book are so much out of date that not one of the elements given therein agrees with the present real cost. I could not, therefore, have any such intention, and [I] hope the feeling now expressed by you is not in any way influenced by the prospect of the arrangements for winding up, or otherwise settling, the affairs of the firm, it being the interest of all parties that such matters should be conducted in a friendly and accommodating spirit.
<br>I am, Sir,
<br>your obedient servant,
<br>Fred. Engels

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 4 November 1862</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>I have just been to see Freiligrath. He will send the 400 talers to Lassalle. You are to send him £60, and he will then advise you of the rate of exchange, etc.</p>
<p>As to the renewal, there is no difficulty. You can draw for £45 or ANY SUM LESS THAN £60 and send me the bill so that Lassalle can endorse it. Once that is done, it is discountable over here. You can made it payable <i>at 3 months.</i> For the renewal, however, Lassalle's endorsement will be needed and hence cannot be obtained in respect of the present payment. Lassalle himself is awaiting this renewal, having had my letter.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Write and let me know at once what is to be done.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

MARX TO EUGEN OSWALD
<br>IN LONDON
<br>[London, 24 September 1873]
<br>Dear Oswald,
<br>In future could you please address yourself directly to the people you wish to recommend and not to me. I wrote to Wroblewski " on the basis of a letter which I had just received from you, while in the meantime, you had recommended Rozwadowski, whom I also knew about, but whom I had overlooked in favour of others, since he already had other employment.
<br>But NEVER MIND.—We needn't fall out over this; however, you must realise that it is unpleasant to be put in a FALSE POSITION like that. I immediately told Wroblewski that the business had come to nothing and I do not think that he was greatly interested.
<br>Yours,
<br>K. M.

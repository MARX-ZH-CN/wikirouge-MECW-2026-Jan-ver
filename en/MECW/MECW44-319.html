MARX TO EUGEN OSWALD</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London, 24 September 1873]</p>
<p>Dear Oswald,</p>
<p>In future could you please address yourself directly to the people you wish to recommend and not to me. I wrote to Wroblewski " on the basis of a letter which I had just received from you, while in the meantime, you had recommended Rozwadowski, whom I also knew about, but whom I had overlooked in favour of others, since he already had other employment.</p>
<p>But NEVER MIND.—We needn't fall out over this; however, you must realise that it is unpleasant to be put in a FALSE POSITION like that. I immediately told Wroblewski that the business had come to nothing and I do not think that he was greatly interested.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>K. M.

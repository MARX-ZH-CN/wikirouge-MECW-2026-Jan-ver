ENGELS TO PYOTR LAVROV</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>London, 14 February 1884</p>
<p>My dear Lavrov,</p>
<p>I have noted what you say about the Russian translation of the 2nd volume of <i>Capital.</i> I shall revert to this at the appropriate moment.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>As to the German edition, you will be aware that over there we are under threat from absolute despotism and that <i>anything</i> is liable to be suppressed. Marx never allowed himself to be inhibited by the legislation of the day; he always spoke his mind and it would be truly miraculous if the 2nd volume did not contain enough confiscable and suppressive material to fall foul of the law of 1878.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>But that is a risk we must run and, as for myself, I certainly have no intention of watering anything down.</p>
<p>When TepMaHi) Aona-raH-B<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>was here<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>he told me that Nikolai Danielson wanted me to return him a book entitled <i>Tpydu KoMUCciu djin u3CJihdoeamH XJIÜÖHOÜ npoMuiumuHocmu</i> es <i>Pocciu.'<b><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>I have now found several books on the marketing and production of grain: the title most closely resembling the one he quotes is </b></i><b>Tpydu atccneduuiu, cmpnuceHHOu uMnepamopcKUMu BojibHUMh sKOHOMunecKUMb u PyccKUMb zeozpacßmecKUMb o6yu,ecmeaMU, ÖMH u3CJit&gt;doeaHW xmômû mopzoenu u npou3eodumem&gt;HOcmu eh Pocciu,'</b><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>Volume 2, 1870.</p>
<p>Might that be the book he is referring to? If so I shall return it to 27 MoHKa,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>St Petersburg as soon as I have your confirmation.</p>
<p>I hope to send off your books<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>next week; I have kept some of them. If I find I don't need them for the 2nd volume, I shall despatch them to you later.</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>F. Engels

This law, better known as the Anti-Socialist Law, made the Social-Democratic Party of Germany illegal, banned all party and mass workers' organisations, and the socialist and workers' press; on the basis of this law socialist literature was confiscated and Social Democrats subjected to reprisals. However, during its operation the Social-Democratic Party, assisted by Marx and Engels, uprooted both reformist and anarchist elements and managed to substantially strengthen and widen its influence among the people by skilfully combining illegal and legal methods of work. Under pressure from the mass workers' movement, the Anti-Socialist Law was abrogated on 1 October 1890. For Engels' assessment of this law, see his article 'Bismarck and the German Working Men's Party' (present edition, Vol. 24, pp. 407-09).</span>

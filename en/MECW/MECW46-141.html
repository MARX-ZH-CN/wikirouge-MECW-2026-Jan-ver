<h4 class="mw-headline" id="ME46-141-2">London, May 3, 1882</h4><a id="London,_May_3,_1882"></a>
<p>Dear Mr Bernstein,</p>
<p>Could you not send me some additional offprints of the article on early Christianity<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> or further copies of the relevant issue? I should like to have them very much and they would come in useful for propaganda purposes. I should send them to people who don't otherwise see the <i>Sozialdemokrat</i>; 3 or 4 would suffice.</p>
<p>Encl. a note which is of interest in that it gives evidence of the colossal speed with which the concentration of capitals is taking place in America. UNITED STATES BONDS are <i>Staatsschuldscheine der Vereinigten Staaten</i>. N.Y.C. and H.R. STOCK are the shares of the NEW YORK CENTRAL and HUDSON RIVER Railroad; REAL ESTATE = <i>Grundbesitz</i>.</p>
<p>A dollar is slightly more than 4 marks = roughly 4 marks = 5 frs. Delighted to see that people everywhere are supporting the Sozialdemokrat against the whines of the milksops.</p>
<p>Darwin's letter was of course addressed to Marx and was an extremely kind one. But beware of the article by Lafargue in the <i>Citoyen</i> of 28 April on '<i>La sélection darwinienne et les classes régnantes</i>' which he concludes with the discovery of a new Amphioxus; it's too funny for words. Lafargue is in Paris and I have just written to him2 8 4 pouring frightful scorn on his <i>Amphioxus Lafargii</i>.</p>
<p>Best wishes.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F. E.</p>

Don't let the Association<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> here deceive you about the Democratic Federation.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> So far it is of no account whatever. It is headed by an ambitious candidate for Parliament by the name of Hyndman, an ex-Conservative, who can get together a big meeting only with the help of the Irish and for specifically Irish purposes. Even then he plays only a third-rate part, otherwise the Irish would give it to him.</p>
<p>Gladstone has discredited himself terribly. His whole Irish policy has suffered shipwreck. He has to drop Forster and the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Cowper-Temple (whose stepfather is Palmerston), and must say a <i>pater peccavi</i>:<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Irish M.P.s<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> have been set free, the Coercion Bill has not been extended, the back rents of the farmers are to be partly cancelled and partly taken over by the state against fair amortisation.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> On the other hand the Tories have already reached the stage where they want to save whatever can still be saved: before the farmers <i>take </i>the land they should redeem the rents with the aid of the state, according to the Prussian model, so that the landowners may get at least <i>something! </i>The Irish are teaching our leisurely John Bull to get a move on. That's what comes from shooting!<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> </p>

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">This refers to a draft conspectus for a report on the Irish question which Marx was to make at the meeting of the German Workers' Educational Association in London on December 16, 1867. "Yesterday I read in our German Workers' Association (but three other German workers' associations were represented there, about 100 people in all) a one-and-a-half hour long report on Ireland," Marx wrote in this connection to Engels on December 17, 1867. Some members of the General Council of the International also attended the meeting. Eccarius, a Council member, who attached great importance to this report, which explained the attitude of the General Council towards the Irish national liberation movement, took notes in order to prepare them for publication. A copy of these notes was sent to Johann Philipp Becker, the editor of <i>Vorbote, a</i> monthly magazine in Geneva, which was the mouthpiece of the German sections of the International Working Men's Association in Switzerland; but it was not published.<br>The <i>London German Workers' Educational Association</i> was founded in February 1840 by German revolutionary emigrants. After the founding of the Communist League — the first international communist organisation of the working class — the leading role in the Association was assumed by the local sections of the League. Marx and Engels took an active part in the Association a activities (except when sectarian elements temporarily gained the upper hand). At the end of the fifties, Friedrich Lessner, a pupil and comrade-in-arms of Marx and Engels, became one of the leaders of the Association. The Association, which was linked with English workers' organisations, participated in the inauguration of the International Working Men's Association in 1864 and began to act as its German section in London. The Association continued to exist up to 1918.</span>

Hyndman. The Federation adopted a bourgeois-democratic programme containing 9 points: universal suffrage, a three-year Parliament, a system of equal electoral districts, the abolition of the House of Lords as a legislative body, independence for Ireland in the field of legislation, nationalisation of the land, etc.<br>At the inaugural conference of the Democratic Federation Hyndman's pamphlet <i>England for All</i> was distributed among the participants. In its two chapters (Chapter II — "Labour," and Chapter III — "Capital") Hyndman included whole sections from the first volume of <i>Capital</i> as programme principles of the Federation. He made no reference to either the author or the book, and in many cases distorted Marx s propositions.<br>In 1884 the Democratic Federation was reorganised as the Social-Democratic Federation.</span>

MARX TO HERMANN JUNG</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 16 November 1871</p>
<p>Dear Jung,</p>
<p>From the enclosed letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>(for the return of which I would be grateful), you can see that this is a favourable moment for us to establish contact with the Paris workers without obtaining permis- sion from Roullier.</p>
<p><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Is there a JEWELLERS' UNION or SOCIETY of any kind? If so, it would be good if you could contact them directly. A reduction in the working hours of the Paris JEWELLERS would be of great importance for the Londoners, since Paris is their greatest competitor.</p>
<p><i>Salut fraternel,</i></p>
<p>Karl Marx

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Marx sent Jung a letter from Mainier, Secretary of the Eastern Paris Section, who requested the General Council on 15 November 1871 to support the Paris jewellers, who intended to go on strike for a shorter working day. Marx's letter to Mainier has not been found. Its content is known from Mainier's reply of 27 November, in which he thanked Marx for his promise of assistance and informed him that no strike had taken place.</span>

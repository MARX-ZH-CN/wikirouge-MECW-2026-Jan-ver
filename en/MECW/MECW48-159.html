ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY</p>
<p>IN VIENNA</p>
<p>London, 18 January 1889</p>
<p>The proposed discussion with Tussy and Edward<sup>3</sup> cannot take place as they are both in Cornwall and don't intend to return until next week or later. Meanwhile Tussy has already written to tell your wife what she could about the case in point. But however that may be, we've got to get you both back here and no doubt this can be done somehow or other by the spring. Now I must return to my mss.,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>which I have had to neglect for the past month—on account of the fog and all manner of correspondences to do with the rumpuses in Paris and London. Warm regards to Louise</p>
<p>from your old friend The General

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 27 May [1859]</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>£ 5 received. You must COLOUR YOUR WAR-ARTICLES A LITTLE MORE seeing that you are writing for A GENERAL NEWSPAPER, not for a scientific military journal.</p>
<p>Something more descriptive and individual could easily be gleaned from the <i>Times</i> CORRESPONDENT, etc. I can't interpolate it myself as this would lead to unevenness of style. Failing this Dana will go and insert some utter nonsense off his own bat.</p>
<p>Today I am sending you 2 numbers (the last ones) of the <i>Presse</i> as samples, so that you can see whether you can use the PAPER.</p>
<p>At 7 o'clock yesterday evening Mr Liebknecht turned up with 6 lines for <i>Das Volk</i> having, by his failure to appear (and the idiot is always taking on all manner of things), thrown the entire setting INTO DISORDER, or so Biskamp tells me. I had told the blockhead exactly which bits of your pamphlet were to be reproduced. Instead he tries to make a LEADER of it, in which, of course, he doesn't succeed. Bürgers <i>redivivus</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> but far WORSE, since Bürgers could at least be used for purposes of attack in societies, etc.</p>
<p>Garibaldi has, in my opinion, deliberately been consigned to a position that will spell his ruin.</p>
<p>Unlike Kossuth who, with Klapka, has already 'recognised' 'Constantine' as the Russian king of Hungary, Mazzini (undoubtedly a greater authority on Italian patriotism than Mr Lassalle) is behaving very well.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I shall try and lay hands on the last, concluding number of his <i>Pensiero ed Azione.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Send me your last copy of <i>Po and Rhine</i> for <i>Mazzini.</i> I shall write a short accompanying note, or <i>better still, write it yourself. Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>Still nothing from Berlin today. I. e. 16 days to correct the misprints in the last 3 sheets!<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </p>

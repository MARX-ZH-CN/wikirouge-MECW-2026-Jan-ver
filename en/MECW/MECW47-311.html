ENGELS TO ELEANOR MARX-AVELING
<br>[IN LONDON]
<br>[London,] 25 March 1886
122 Regent's Park Road, N.W.
<br>My dear Tussy,
<br>You know I would do anything in my forces to please our friend Donkin, but I am afraid I cannot do so in this case.
<br>The work I have had in hand for the last few years is so urgent and of such dimensions that I have had to give up, once for all, attending meetings and societies and taking part in discussions or preparing for such. If I am to accomplish my work, I cannot break through this rule, and the less so, as having given way once, I could not plead the same reason again for refusing in other cases.
<br>Moreover the subject I am asked to discuss, has been lost sights of by me for more than a year,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and I should therefore be compelled to read it up again and to look at whatever has been published since with respect to it, which would take me more than a week to be exclusively devoted to that purpose, and that week, I am sorry to say, I cannot spare.
<br>And therefore, highly flattered as I feel by the invitation, I very much regret that circumstances will not allow me to avail myself of it.
<br>Yours affectionately,
<br>F. Engels
<br>Kindest regards to Dr Donkin!

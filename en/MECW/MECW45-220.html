MARX TO SIGMUND SCHOTT
<br>IN FRANKFURT AM MAIN
<br>[London,] 15 July 1878
<br>Dear Friend,
<br>I got your letter on the very day I had already sent you a brief note<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> by a roundabout route.
<br>In your last letter but one (of 30 June), you asked me <i>nothing</i> save whether some of the comments in the German press on my first epistle to <i>The Daily News</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> had reached me. Answer: no.
<br>I would not dream of dedicating a 'book' to Mr Bucher. He owes me an answer to my 30 lines.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> I have neither the time nor any reason to supply the 3,000 lines he deems necessary in place of his own.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> This fable is the progeny of the London correspondent of the <i>Vossische Zeitung,</i> he, so far as I am aware, being Dr Elard Biscamp, a notorious blackguard.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> This time, however, his bad joke has come off.
<br>The state of my health bids me go to Karlsbad. But Mr Bismarck, who was so urgently bidden to go to Kissingen, doesn't want me to.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> что делать? <i>(que faire?),</i> as the Russians say.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> <br>Look round for a makeshift in the shape of a British seaside resort not as yet under the aegis of the new Holy Alliance's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> saviours of society. My wife is seriously ill and will probably have to go to Karlsbad; it seems unlikely that her ex-ladyship, the ex-Baroness von Westphalen, will be regarded as contraband.
<br>I trust your trip will do you good. Should you spend any length of time in one place, you might write to me from there. I shall probably have an article of mine in English (not yet printed)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> to send you which, however, will have absolutely nothing to do with the good FATHERLAND, AS THE ENGLISH CALL IT.
<br>With kindest regards,
<br>Yours,
<br>Karl Marx

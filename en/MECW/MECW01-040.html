<br>Dear Friend,
<br>I take the liberty of sending you a small contribution for the <i>Deutsche Jahrbücher</i> in the form of the enclosed criticism of the censorship instruction.
<br>If the article is suitable for your journal, I ask you for the time being not to mention <i>my name to anyone except Wigand</i>, and also to Send me <i>by post immediately</i> the issues of the <i>Deutsche Jahrbücher</i> containing my article; because <i>for the time being</i> here in Trier I am completely excluded from the literary world.
<br>It is obvious that it is in the interest of the cause that the printing should be expedited, if the censorship does not censor my censure.
<br>If you do not know of a critic for Vatke's super-clever book on sin - were it not so devilishly clever, one would be tempted to call it stupid--my critical zeal is at your disposal.
<br>It would perhaps be equally worth while to deal again with Bayer's work on the moral Spirit. Feuerbach's criticism was a friendly service. Honourable as is Bayer's moral frame of mind, his work itself is just as weak and even immoral.
<br>I should be very glad if you would let <i>Wigand</i> know that my manuscript will reach you in a few days' time. <i>Bauer's</i> letter in which he demands that it should be sent off <i>at last</i>, came when I was very ill in bed and therefore was handed to me only a few days ago. Being busy on the enclosed article, I was not able to make the necessary corrections.
<br>As I have now come to the end of some voluminous works, it goes without saying that all my forces are at the disposal of the <i>Deutsche Jahrbücher</i>.
<br>With sincere respect,
<br>Marx
<br>My address is: Dr. Marx, Trier, to be delivered to Geheimer Regierungsrat von Westphalen.

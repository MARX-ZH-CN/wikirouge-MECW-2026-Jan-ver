<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>I fully agree with the plan for the <i>Anekdota philosophica</i> and also think it would be better to include <i>my name</i> among the others. A demonstration of this kind, by its very nature, <i>precludes</i> all anonymity. Those gentlemen must see that one's conscience is clear.</p>
<p>With the sudden revival of the Saxon censorship it is obvious from the outset that it will be quite impossible to print my "Treatise on <i>Christian Art</i>," which should have appeared as the second part of the <i>Posaune</i>. But what about including it in a modified version in the <i>Anekdota</i>? The mass of material obnoxious to the censorship which now fills people's minds perhaps makes it possible also to publish the <i>Anekdota</i>, as material accumulates, in a number of separate intalments! Another article which I also intended for the <i>Deutsche Jahrbücher</i> is a criticism of Hegelian natural law, insofar as it concerns the <i>internal political system</i>. The central point is the struggle against <i>constitutional monarchy</i> as a hybrid which from beginning to end contradicts and abolishes itself. <i>Res publica</i> is quite untranslatable into German. I would send both these articles immediately for your examination if they did not require the rewriting of a fair copy and, in pan, some corrections. The fact is that my future father-in-law, Herr von Westphalen, lay on his death-bed for three months and died the day before yesterday. During this period, therefore, it was impossible to do anything properly.</p>
<p>Regarding the other things, next time.</p>
<p>With sincerest respect, Devotedly yours, Marx</p>
<p>Apropos. Through an oversight, the manuscript on the censorship contains the phrase: "the censorship of tendency and the tendency censorship." It should be: "the censorship of tendency and the tendency of censorship."</p>
<p>Be so kind as to send me the reply directly by post to Trier.</p>
<p>Bauer has been suspended from his post, as he writes in a letter just received, <i>par lit de justice</i>.

<p>Finally we warn you against any putsch in Cologne. In the military situation obtaining in Cologne you would be irretrievably lost. You have seen in Elberfeld that the bourgeoisie sends the workers into the fire and betrays them afterwards in the most infamous way. A state of siege in Cologne would demoralize the entire Rhine Province, and a state of siege would be the inevitable consequence of any rising on your part at this moment. The Prussians will be frustrated by your calmness.</p>
<p>In bidding you farewell the editors of the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> thank you for the sympathy you have shown them. Their last word everywhere and always will be: emancipation of the working class!

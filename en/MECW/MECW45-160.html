MARX TO PYOTR LAVROV
<br>IN LONDON
<br>[London,] 17 April 1877 My dear Friend,
<br>The agent has just handed me the fee of £2.10/- due to you from <i>Vanity Fair</i>; I am sending it by the enclosed POST-OFFICE order.
<br>I am truly astonished by your letter. It was at my request that you took the trouble to write—and promptly at that—not only the article published, but also the manuscript for the Member of Parliament,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and yet you feel you are under an obligation to me! On the contrary, I am the one under an obligation.
<br>We can discuss the Pio affair<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> when you keep your promise and come and see me.
<br>Yours ever,
<br>Karl Marx
<br>If they ask at the POST OFFICE for the name of the 'SENDER', you should give my name and address.

P. Keyes O'Clery. The latter used the information in his speeches delivered in the House of Commons on 3 and 14 May 1877 (see <i>MEGA,</i> Erste Abteilung, Band 25, S. 462). Pyotr Lavrov also wrote an article in French entitled 'La justice en Russie', which Marx helped to get printed in the British weekly <i>Vanity Fair</i> on 14 April 1877.</span>

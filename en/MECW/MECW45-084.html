MARX TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>[London, 14 June 1876]</p>
<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>I am today sending you for the third time <i>livraisons</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Nos. 31-44 of <i>Capital";</i> should you once more fail to receive them, let me know immediately, then I shall pick a SERIOUS QUARREL with the GENERAL POST OFFICE here. As for meddling by Dr Kugelmann <i>(resp.</i> Meissner, which I cannot credit, though I shall inquire further from the man himself), I was greatly surprised to hear of it since I am not yet a 'goner' and hence no one apart from myself has any say in the disposal of my writings.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>By 'scandalous goings-on' I meant what you suppose, but shan't be needing it until towards the end of September.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Shall send you a copy of the Most, corrected by me, forthwith; didn't put my name to it because I should then have had to make even more alterations (I had to delete the bits about value, money, wages and much else, and substitute things of my own).</p>
<p>More anon. Warm regards from the whole FAMILY.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

In his reply of 2 June 1876, Sorge wrote that Kugelmann had asked several months earlier for these articles to be included in Marx's complete works planned by the Hamburg publisher Otto Meissner. Sorge had received this information from Livingstone, who kept the articles from the <i>Tribune</i> after Hermann Meyer's death. Livingstone refused to send them to Kugelmann without Marx's knowledge.</span>

ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT</p>
<p>IN LEIPZIG</p>
<p>Manchester, 21 September 1865</p>
<p>Dear Liebknecht,</p>
<p>It was bad luck that you chose to write to me just as I was leaving for 3 weeks on the Continent,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> so that I only found your letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> waiting for me on my return. The £5 banknote B/V 68754, Manchester, 16 January 1865, encl. as requested.</p>
<p>I cannot write much today, as I want to get the banknote sent off as well; but I will just say that Marx has, of course, every reason to be angry with you. The manner in which you rebutted Becker's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> absurd allegations against Marx in your Berlin defence-speech was exceedingly weak and incompetent, and in respect of both the Bangya-affair<sup>I69</sup> and several others you twisted the facts as much as did Mr Becker, although you could easily have gained better knowledge by referring to <i>Herr Vogt</i><sup>2i4</sup> These are extremely disagreeable matters, which Madame Hatzfeldt will now purvey to the world in this distorted form, and with your seal of approvals and you demand that Moor should take all that so calmly?</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

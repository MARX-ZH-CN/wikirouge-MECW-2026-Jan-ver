ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>IN ZURICH</p>
<p>London, 28 May 1887</p>
<p>For heaven's sake please <i>don't</i> publish Jonas' deplorable translation of my preface<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> in the <i>Sozialdemokrat.</i> Have just done one myself, having with much difficulty finally retrieved the ms. of the English original from America. But I've also offered it to the Baron<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> —the Baron has just been here. He will surrender to you my translation of the preface and is getting a copy done with all speed, as my ms. must go off to America at once to oust the Jonasiad. Singer has been over here; told of C. A. Schramm's latest heroic deed in regard to yourself—what next? Tomorrow's conference of the delegates of the Socialist League will decide its fate.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> I have still not received a single copy of the English <i>Lage</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> while K. Kautsky has been sent 18, so I'll finally get one tomorrow. Fine goings-on! My eye is improving slowly.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

That same year the article appeared, in Engels' German translation, under the heading 'Die Arbeiterbewegung in Amerika', in the <i>Sozialdemokrat</i> (10 and 17 June). In July separate prints, in German and English, were distributed in New York. The article was also published as a pamphlet in London (see present edition, Vol. 26) and, in French, in <i>Le Socialiste</i> (9, 16 and 23 July). Even before the publication of the book the article was, without Engels' knowledge, translated into German by Alexander Jonas, editor of the <i>New Yorker Volkszeitung</i>, and published in this paper in April 1887. Engels, displeased with the quality of the translation, lodged an official protest.</span>

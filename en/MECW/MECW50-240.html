ENGELS TO EMMA ADLER</p>
<p>IN VIENNA</p>
<p>London, 1 January 1895<br>41 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Mrs Adler,</p>
<p>I am most grateful for your kind good wishes as also for those of your husband and children which I wholeheartedly reciprocate. I trust that the New Year will be a thoroughly enjoyable one for you in every way. Today a new and promising field of activity has opened up for you and Victor and no doubt we shall frequently be able to detect your own hand in it. All of us over here wish this new enterprise, the daily <i>Arbeiter-Zeitung, 337</i> the very best of success in the practical field.</p>
<p>Please tell Victor that I will answer his last letter within the next few days<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>and that I have sent him today, by <b>registered</b> post, a copy of the 3<sup>rd</sup> volume of Marx's <i>Das Kapital. 452</i> No doubt it will have already arrived by the time this reaches you; like this letter it is addressed to Windmühlgasse 30A.</p>
<p>Once again my best wishes and cordial regards to you all from</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F. Engels

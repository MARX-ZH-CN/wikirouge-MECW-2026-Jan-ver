ENGELS TO PYOTR LAVROV</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 23 February 1882<br>
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>My Dear Friend,</p>
<p>The <i>Financial Reform Almanack 1882</i> gives the following addresses: Dilke, W. Ashton, 1 Hyde Park Gate, S. W. Ditto Sir Charles, 76 Sloane St, S. W. When I got home from your place I found a letter from Dr Donkin (the one who treated Hartmann some time ago, and also the Marx family) in which he says:
</p>
<ul><li>'I had a letter from Hartmann a few days ago (dating from 14 Huntley St, Bedford Sq.) asking me if he might come and see me. I answered his letter directly — giving him the choice of two days — but have heard nothing of him.</li></ul>
<p>'In case my letters have miscarried will you tell me if you know anything about him. If you see him perhaps you will tell him that I will see him any morning here (60 Upper Berkeley St., W.) between 11 and 12 o'clock.'*</p>
<p>Would you be so kind as to pass on the preceding lines to Hartmann? Since Donkin's letter failed to arrive, I fear there may be some mistake as to the <i>number,</i> of which I am not sure, since I know of it only from Donkin. Hence it is impossible for me to communicate with Hartmann direct or with any certainty, and that is why I am asking you to act as intermediary, the more so since you say it is quite close to your place.</p>
<p>I am replying to Donkin,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>saying that I hope to be able to tell him something more precise within the next few days; if possible, could you let me have some further information concerning this mat- ter on Sunday evening?</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>F. Engels

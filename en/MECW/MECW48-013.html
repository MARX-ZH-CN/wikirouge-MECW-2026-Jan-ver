ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>London, 24 February 1887</p>
<p>My dear Laura,</p>
<p>The <i>Révolution en Allemagne-Prise de Berlin</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> —does not exactly come off in the way depicted in the <i>Way of the People.</i> The <i>Voie du peuple</i> on the other side of the Vosges is not exactly along the Boulevards of beautiful Paris. Not to speak of their mistakes about seats lost and gained, etc., the success of our German friends lies in another direction than where they seek it.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> First of all, we have so far lost seats and not gained any, but that, though a fact, counts for nothing. The decisive fact is that, while we are very slowly losing ground in the Saxon districts of <i>hand-weaving</i> (which is dying out) and which were our original strong- holds, we are gaining far more rapidly not only in the large towns but in all rural industrial districts. I have the exact figures of 43 districts with one deputy each, including Berlin, Hamburg, Dresden, Munich, Leipzig, Hanover, Magdeburg, Elberfeld, Cologne, Düsseldorf, Nürnberg, Stuttgart, Frankfurt etc, mostly large towns of course.</p>
<p>In these we had in all votes 408,360 in the same places in 1884 321,876<br>
Gained<br>
86,484</p>
<p>or 27 per cent on the votes of 1884, in 3 years; and these include 5 districts in which we lost votes. In a day or two I shall have more data to extend my list which comprises all districts the figures of which I know. Berlin has come out splendidly and I begin to have some confidence in that otherwise ridiculous town.</p>
<p>The pressure brought to bear on our people was tremendous. Not even public proclamation of their candidates was allowed. Every one who took a part in the election by distributing <i>bulletins de vote</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> etc. was noted—which means expulsion in the numerous towns under state of siege. Wherever possible, the manufacturers conducted them to the poll and saw that they voted for Bismarck unless they wanted immediate discharge from work. And all this will be repeated and increased on the day of ballotage where we expect to secure most of our seats.</p>
<p>Singer is the Lockroy;<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> —<i>le premier élu de l'Allemagne.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> He had 32,227 votes which no other member can boast of. Bebel is in for Hamburg, Liebknecht out for Offenbach<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> had he had 50 more votes, he would have been in the ballot at Bremen and then sure of election. But there are sure to be double elections so that he will not want the place whereon to rest his hind quarters.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> The exact number of ballots in which we are interested I do not know; 16 at the least. These we shall almost all carry, as far as I can see—and unless we are left in the lurch by the Centre<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> or Progressists,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> which is quite on the cards.</p>
<p>While ordinarily but 55 to 65% of the voters polled, this time the philistine came up in force; 85 to 90% of the number on the list. And this accounts for many defeats.</p>
<p>I am extremely glad of the Alsatian vote.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> That will help us to get rid of these non-descripts—neither fish nor flesh nor good red herring—all the easier.</p>
<p>In a day or two you will get a printed circular with Aveling's reply to the charges of the New York Executive.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> If this circular has not been sent to the German club in Paris, then it has not been sent to Paris at all. It is nothing but the usual complaint of <i>Knoten</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> against <i>Gelehrte</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> that they lived extravagantly on the pence of the working man. Fortunately we have a good reply.</p>
<p>Tell Paul that his discovery about Oriental Circumcision<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup> shares the fate of many of my discoveries in natural science viz. that it had been made before. I have read the same thing long ago in German books and should not wonder if it was already in old Creuzer's <i>Symbolik</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup> which is as old as the battle of Waterloo.</p>
<p>Poor Edward had an awful shock about these ridiculous accusations, so soon after his quinsy. He is not over-endowed with power of resis- tance to malady, and so this threw him back very much. He has been off and on at Hastings and is going off again to-night.</p>
<p>The last page of the <i>Voie</i> to-day<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup> looks rather queer, all <i>Bel Ami</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup> and no advertisements.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18" id="cite_ref-18">[18]</a></sup> Rather too much for one dose, I should think.</p>
<p>Half past five—<i>Postschluss</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19" id="cite_ref-19">[19]</a></sup> —and Dinner Bell! So farewell for to-day.</p>
<p>Very affectionately yours</p>
<p>F. Engels

<li id="cite_note-8"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-8">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The Centre was a political party of German Catholics formed in June 1870. It expressed the separatist and anti-Prussian sentiments current in West and Southwest Germany. (The seats of its Reichstag deputies were in the centre of the hall, hence the name of the party.) The Centre's following consisted of socially disparate sections of Catholic clergy, landowners, bourgeois and peasants. Its deputies usually took a noncommittal attitude, manoeuvring between the pro-government parties and the Left opposition groups. Although it opposed the Bismarck government in the mid-1870s and early 1880s, the Centre voted for its measures against the working-class and socialist movement. Engels gave a detailed characterisation of the Centre in his work The Role of Force in History (see present edition, Vol. 26) and in his article 'What Now?' (see Vol. 27).</span>

<li id="cite_note-9"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-9">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The Party of Progress, founded in June 1861, advocated the unification of Germany under the aegis of Prussia, the convocation of an all-German parliament, and a liberal Ministry responsible to the Chamber of Deputies. Fearing a popular revolution, it did not support the basic democratic demands - universal suffrage and the freedom of the press, association and assembly. In 1866 the Party of Progress split. Its right wing founded the National Liberal Party, which capitulated to the Bismarck government. After the final unification of Germany in 1871, the Progressists continued to describe themselves as an opposition party, but their opposition was purely declaratory. In March 1884 they merged with the left wing of the National Liberals to form the German Free-Thinking Party (Die Deutsche Freisinnige Partei).</span>

ENGELS TO VICTOR ADLER</p>
<p>IN VIENNA <i>[Draft]</i></p>
<p>[London, 27 December 1894]</p>
<p>Dear Victor,</p>
<p>I would ask you to convey my congratulations to the Austrian workers on their daily paper. Its first daily paper invariably signifies a tremendous step forward in the life of a party, especially of a workers' party. It is the first position from which it can tackle its opponents with the same weapons, at least in the field of the press. You have won this position; now the second is at stake: suffrage, parliament. And you are certain of this too, if you exploit the political situation—becoming ever more favourable to you as it is with the same skill as [you have done] in the past fifteen months; if you are determined to act at the right time, but also, as so often necessary, determined to wait at the right time; if you know how to let circumstances act on your behalf.</p>
<p>Good luck and success to the daily <i>Arbeiter-Zeitung!</i></p>
<p>Yours
</p>

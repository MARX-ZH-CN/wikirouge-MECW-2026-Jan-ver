ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 25 June 1868</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>We were never so shocked here as this morning when your news arrived that your girls have scarlet fever. The thing has been on my mind all day; I hope everything goes well, and <i>here,</i> as I see from a medical report, all cases of that sort this year have passed<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>off remarkably benignly. What sort of a doctor have you got, for you cannot take risks in such cases; <i>my means are at your disposal,</i> write or telegraph if you need anything, and you will have it immediately if it is at all possible.</p>
<p>Yesterday I sent you two five-pound notes S/K 60 115 and 60 116 <i>unregistered.</i></p>
<p>Let me know very frequently how things are going. Lizzie was terribly upset when I read this out to her; she has a tremendous affection for Tussy and talks about her all day long. And now good little Jenny has to get the sickness, too. You have really been terribly unlucky.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, I do not wish to write about other things, and they would not interest you as long as the present state of affairs continues. I enclose a few lines to Tussy to entertain her, and on the orders of Lizzie.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>On no account leave us without news.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

MARX TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE</p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>[London,] 6 November 1871</p>
<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>Today 100 copies (50 in French and 50 in English) of the Conference resolutions<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>are being sent off to New York. The decisions not intended for publication will be communicated to you later.</p>
<p>A new, <i>revised</i> edition of the Rules and Regulations<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>is due to appear in English tomorrow, and you will receive 1,000 copies for sale in America (Id. each). The text must not be translated into French and German in New York, as we are issuing <i>official</i> editions in both languages.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>Write us how many copies in each language will be wanted.</p>
<p>I have turned over the correspondence with the German Section and the New York Committee<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>to <i>Eccarius</i> (he has been appointed to handle that at my suggestion), since my time does not allow me to perform this function properly.</p>
<p>Section 12 (New York) has submitted proposals to the General Council that it be constituted the leader in America. Eccarius will have sent the decisions against these pretensions and for the present Committee<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>to Section 12.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>As for the Washington BRANCH (which has sent the General Council a list of its members), the New York Committee went too far.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>It had no right to demand anything but the number of members and the name, etc., of the corresponding secretary.</p>
<p>More in the next letter (this week).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>K. M.

Its leaders, the feminists Victoria Woodhull and Tennessee Claflin, began campaigning for bourgeois reforms on behalf of the International. On 27 September 1871, without the knowledge of the New York Central Committee, Section No. 12 demanded that the General Council recognise it as the leading body of the International in the USA. Simultaneously it campaigned in the press against the sections which upheld the proletarian character of the International.<br>In its resolution of 5 November 1871 the General Council rejected the claims of Section No. 12 and confirmed the powers of the New York Central Committee. Nevertheless Section No. 12 continued to act in the same vein, which led to a split between the proletarian and petty-bourgeois sections. In March 1872 the General Council expelled Section No. 12 from the International, and in September 1872 this decision was confirmed by the Hague Congress.</span>

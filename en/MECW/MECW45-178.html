ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Ramsgate, 24 July 1877</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Newspapers, etc., received. Very many thanks. Your plan does at any rate have the advantage of killing quite a lot of birds with one stone; I can only hope that the chief one, your liver, won't suffer accordingly/ Still, with so many medical authorities in favour, there's not much one can really say against it from that viewpoint either. Who knows whether this time Neuenahr won't do you more good than Karlsbad?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>It's simply a lottery, <i>espérons le mieux}</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>For essential needs enclosed CHEQUE for <i>£101.3.7</i>—the non-round sum is intentional! At all events you really ought to come here for a few days and bring Hirsch with you if it can be managed. The change of air will do you good. By the way, I had thought of coming up to London once again for a day before 12 August, but don't let yourself be put off by such uncertainties.</p>
<p>What Hirsch has to say about France is very encouraging, particularly just now, even when one allows for some exaggera- tion. It's excellent that he should be giving a good account of himself. High time that a few people, at least, gave a good account of themselves when so many are turning into fools and ragamuf- fins.</p>
<p>The <i>Zukunft's</i> estimable letter returned herewith. One in identical terms has been forwarded to me from London.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>I think my reply will be as follows: firstly, it's impossible to agree to contributes» to a scientific periodical with editors that are anonymous and contributors likewise unnamed. Congress resolu- tions, however unexceptionable they may be in the field of practical agitation, count for nothing in that of science, nor do they suffice to establish a periodical's scientific nature — something that cannot be decreed.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>A socialist scientific periodical without a quite definite scientific line is an absurdity and, given the present epidemic in Germany of diverse and indefinite lines, there has so far been no guarantee whatsoever that the line to be adopted will suit us.— Secondly, however, after finishing the Dühring,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>I shall have to confine myself to my own independent work and shan't therefore have the time. What do you think of it? There's no hurry.</p>
<p>You will see from the enclosed letter from Liebknecht, which I would like to have back so that I can answer it,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>that Mr Dühring 'couldn't tarry till the hour of twelve had struck'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>and has been the cause of his own undoing.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>All this was, of course, the fruit of silly Wilhelm's sagacity, and such is his childish glee that he doesn't even notice how much 'the party' has been discredited as a result. What is one to do with people like these? On top of that the man is still quite proud of his articles on France in which he simply endorses Hasenclever's nonsense.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>However we'd better wait and see whether all the jubilation over Dühring's downfall doesn't fizzle out again.</p>
<p>The Russian moves are extremely bold, but what good will they do anyone if the Turks' conduct of the war remains as it has been for the past four weeks? The right course was to march on the Russian flank with a combined force from Shumla and Rustchuk<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>and smite it. They now <i>have</i> the best pass in the Balkans (the Shipka) which they can easily hold and, according to today's news, the Turks are sending troops from Shumla via Jamboli<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup>to Rumelia in order to display themselves to the Russians there, instead of transferring the troops from Rumelia—the Adriano- ple<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup>garrison excepted — to Shumla and attacking Sistova<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup>with all available forces. The Turkish leadership <i>has</i> clearly allowed itself to be intimidated and has blundered accordingly. Moreover, it has everywhere abandoned the <i>now ripe</i> harvest to the Russians who therefore have enough to eat. Abdul Kerim has allowed the Turkish army to run so much to seed that more than 20% are in hospital, while the <i>Kölnische Zeitung's</i> Prussian lieutenant says that in Shumla he saw crowds of Turkish officers (not men) drunk on spirits. And all as a result of inaction. It drives one wild to see such a magnificent position and such splendid fighting material go to waste like this. All the same the Russians won't get to Constantinople, nor will they find it so easy to deny even the Turks in the quadrilateral of fortresses<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup>their supplies of food. Moreover, they have only two months left in which to force a decision and hence, despite all the follies of the Turks, this year's campaign has already as good as failed—were unpredictability not the rule out there! The despatch of British troops will probably be enough to prevent the Sultan<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup>from concluding a separate peace, and that's what's good about it.</p>
<p>Lizzie is doing better. She went through a serious crisis on Sunday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup>and now seems to be gradually recovering.</p>
<p>Best wishes to everyone,</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

<li id="cite_note-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-3">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">On 20 July 1877 the<i> Zukunft</i> editors wrote to Marx and Engels inviting them to contribute to the magazine and referring to the relevant decision of the Gotha Congress to start a scientific review (see Note 314). The letters were signed 'The<i> Zukunft</i> editorial board' and gave the forwarding office of the<i> Berliner  Freie Presse,</i> edited by Johann Most, as its address.</span>
</li>
<li id="cite_note-4"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-4">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">At its sitting on 29 May 1877 the Gotha Congress of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany (see Note 286) approved August Geib's proposal to have a scientific review published twice monthly in Berlin starting on 1 October. It was decided that a fortnightly theoretical supplement to the<i> Vorwärts</i> was to appear up to that date. The first issue of<i> Die Zukunft. Socialistische Revue</i> came out in Berlin in October; its editor was Karl Höchberg, who worked under the penname of R.-F. Seifert. He sought to give the magazine a reformist slant.</span>
</li>
<li id="cite_note-5"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-5">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The publication of Eugen Dühring's<i> Cursus der Philosophie als streng wis  senschaftlicher Weltanschauung und Lebensgestaltung</i> and the second edition of his <i>Kritische Geschichte der Nationalökonomie und des Sozialismus</i> (1875) made his views very popular in Germany. Among the German Social-Democrats, he acquired such followers as Johann Most, Friedrich Wilhelm Fritzsche, and Eduard Bernstein. Even August Bebel came under his influence for a short time. In view of this, in his letters to Engels of 1 February and 21 April 1875, Liebknecht proposed that the latter use<i> Der Volksstaat</i> to criticise Dühring's views.<br>Engels did so for the first time in the essay 'Prussian Schnapps in the German Reichstag' carried by<i> Der Volksstaat</i> in February 1876 (see present edition, Vol. 24).<br>Marx agreed with Engels that Dühring's views had to be exposed to serious criticism. Engels interrupted the work on<i> Dialectics of Nature</i> which he had begun in May 1873 and made a start on<i> Anti-Diihring</i> (see present edition, Vol. 25). It took him over two years, from May 1876 to July 1878, to complete it. Part I of the book was mainly written between September 1876 and January 1877 and was printed in the<i> Vorwärts</i> as a series of articles under the heading <i>Herrn Eugen Dühring's Umwälzung der Philosophie</i> in January-May 1877.<br>Part II was written in July-August 1877. Marx contributed Chapter X. This part was published under the heading<i> Herrn Eugen Dühring's Umwälzung der  politischen Oekonomie</i> in the<i> Wissenschaftliche Beilage</i> and the supplement to the <i>Vorwärts</i> in July-December 1877.<br>Part III was written mostly between August 1877 and April 1878 and appeared in the<i> Vorwärts</i> in May-July 1878 under the title<i> Herrn Eugen  Dühring's Umwälzung des Sozialismus. </i><br>The book aroused strong resistance on the part of Dühring's followers. At a regular party congress held in Gotha from 27 to 29 May 1877, they tried to prevent the publication of Engels' work in the party's central organ. <i>Anti-Diihring</i> appeared in the newspaper with lengthy intervals.<br>In July 1877, Part I of the book was published in Leipzig as a separate pamphlet. In July 1878, Parts II and III were also published there as a separate pamphlet. The first complete edition of<i> Anti-Dühring,</i> with Engels' preface, appeared at the same time.<br>In late October 1878, following the introduction of the Anti-Socialist Law in Germany,<i> Anti-Dühring</i> was banned along with Engels' other works.</span>

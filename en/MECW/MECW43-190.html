MARX TO ENGELS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>London, 24 April 1869</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>For ABOUT 12 days I have been suffering dreadfully with my old liver complaints. I am swigging the old medicine from Gumpert, but so far without success. As a result, I am completely paralysed mentally. This condition appears every spring. If I do not pass through it SAFELY, the CARBUNCLES come next. So please ask Gumpert if he knows of anything new for me. I have not smoked for a week. <i>Ça suffit</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> to make clear to you my state.</p>
<p>It will take me a few days to get the information for Borchardt from Dupont. I cannot find the copies of <i>Zukunft.</i> Apropos. The new 'sub-Stieber' who now edits <i>Hermann</i> is named, or calls himself, 'Dr' Heinemann, and claims to come from Manchester. Do you know anything about him?</p>
<p>The worthy 'Hillmann' from Elberfeld has written to me. I'll send you his letter on Monday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> He attacks Liebknecht on account of his renewed armistice with Schweitzer, as a result of which the fruits of victory have been lost. Hillmann the Honorable was, in 1867, the rival worker candidate to Schweitzer.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> <i>Hinc Mae lacrimae.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> <i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

His candidature was opposed by that of Hillmann which the workers did not support: Hillmann received only 52 votes. However, Schweitzer, who received 4,668 votes, was not elected either.</span>

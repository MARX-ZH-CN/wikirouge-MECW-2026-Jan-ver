MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>[London,] 7 June [1859]</p>
<p>DEAR Frederick,</p>
<p>You must excuse me for not writing to you before, and only these few lines. My time has been completely taken u p with work and with running private and party errands.</p>
<p><i>D'abord</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I was delighted to hear that you liked the first instalment,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> for your opinion is the only one I value in this matter. T o my wife's considerable AMUSEMENT, I awaited WITH SOME ANXIETY YOUR JUDGMENT.</p>
<p><i>Ad vocem</i>'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>Volk':<i> Admittedly its administration leaves a great deal to be desired, since there is only one type-setter, no errand-boy, etc., on top of which not a single 'trustworthy' despatch clerk has yet presented himself, and above all, no money. Nevertheless, recent issues have been virtually sold out and if ways and means</i></p>
<p>can be found of appointing a reasonably reliable despatch clerk, the thing will survive. Moreover, the 'little sheet', although only indirectly given a TURN by us, has set the whole of democracy by the ears. Not just here, but also in Switzerland, where Vogt- Kinkel have pitched into me in the <i>Handels-Courier</i> with one of those blackguardly little articles with which you are familiar.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> I'll get them to reproduce it in the next number.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>I shall speak to Biskamp on the Manchester question. For his part, <i>he</i> asked me yesterday to write and tell <i>you</i> that <i>not a single</i> copy had been ordered in Manchester. It looks to me as though <i>Hollinger</i> (the printer) has already been bribed by Kinkel. <i>Nous verrons.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Kinkel, following an audience with Kossuth and money pay- ments from Vogt, has gone over to the camp of high treason. Bücher and Blind have resigned in 'indignation'. Kinkel's col- leagues are now as follows: Bamberger, Ed. Bauer, Beta <i>(How do you do?)</i> and Born<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> (our ex-Born's brother). A fine lot. Add to which one or two old whores.</p>
<p><i>Ad vocem Freiligrath.</i> Between ourselves, a rotter. Having now seen that things are taking a revolutionary TURN (you must have heard about the labour RIOT in Berlin)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> and that Kinkel is becoming DISRESPECTABLE, he reviles him. But the sixth and last volume of his collected works (<i><sup>s</sup>'<b>/é</b></i><b> of it translated rubbish) published in America, which he has just received and sent me, concludes with the poem about Johanna Mockel,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> whereas he has suppressed the anfi-Kinkel poem.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> This is a filthy thing to do and it was with very sceptical mien that I listened to his excuses on the subject. The devil take the bardic profession.</b></p>
<p><i>Ad vocem Vogt.</i> Has placed himself at Prussia's 'disposal' in the <i>Volks-Zeitung</i> (Berlin).</p>
<p><i>Ad vocem Duncker.</i> That dolt Duncker, to whom I had written in exceedingly rude terms about his dilly-dallying, has sent me a letter admitting outright that the last delay of 3 weeks (when <i>everything</i> had been completed save for the list of misprints) was <i>due to the publication</i> of the 'anonymous pamphlet',<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> the one concocted of 'sweat, fire and logic'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> I <i>deliberately</i> divulged to the press the fact that you were the author of <i>Po and Rhine,</i> because</p>
<p>I had good reason to suppose that the author of the 'anonymous pamphlet' was quietly 'switching places' with you. I must say, it's a bit thick, Mr Lassalle placing an embargo on me at will! The thing is coming out in Berlin this week—my first instalment, I mean.</p>
<p>Finally, whatever happens and as soon as the MEANS READY, I shall come to Manchester for a few days as we have all sorts of things to settle.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>Regards to lupullum.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup> Tomorrow I shall send you copies of the <i>Presse</i> (in which quarter the 'anonymous one' has put a spoke in my wheel good and proper).</p>
<p>The rotten STAFF here is no joke, I assure you. Biskamp at least writes quickly and has a ready wit. Liebknecht is AN AWFUL NUISANCE. Due to his over-ingenious manoeuvrings, the little sheet was only able to publish the gossip about Kinkel and Bauer in a much attenuated form.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Your article<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16" id="cite_ref-16">[16]</a></sup> appeared in the <i>Volk</i> on the same day it arrived. The last number contains the preface to my affair,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17" id="cite_ref-17">[17]</a></sup> i. e. with such omissions as Mr Biskamp thought fit.

What remained of the Assembly  moved to Stuttgart, where it was dispersed by Württemberg troops on 18 June  1849.  The petty-bourgeois democrat Löwe von Calbe was a deputy to the  Assembly in 1848-49.</span>

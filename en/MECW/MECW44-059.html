MARX TO HERMANN JUNG</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 18 January<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> 1871</p>
<p>Dear Jung,</p>
<p>I have in yesterday's sitting of the General Council fully exposed the past history of Jules Favre. I send you a few main points relating to his counterrevolutionary deeds.</p>
<p>The Council has also yesterday passed a Resolution instructing you to write to the Editors of the <i>Felleisen</i>—as the Organ of the German <i>Arbeiterbildungsvereine</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> in Switzerland—in the following sense:</p>
<p>1) What is the position of those <i>Vereine</i> and their organ, the <i>Felleisen,</i> to the <i>International Workingmen's Association?</i></p>
<p>2) Till now they have never paid any contribution to the General Council.</p>
<p>3) In their organ—the <i>Felleisen</i>—the annexation to Germany of Alsace and Lorraine is defended in flagrant contradiction to the circulars of the General Council<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> of which not even an extract has ever been published by them.</p>
<p>4) If they persist in the non-fulfilment of their duties (point 2) and in their opposition to the policy of the General Council (point 3), which is in consonance with the Statutes of the <i>International,</i> the General Council, using the right deferred to him by the Basel Congress, will provisionally—that is to say until the meeting of next General Congress—exclude them from the <i>International</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Yours fraternally,</p>
<p>Karl Marx</p>
<p>Ladendorf is no longer the Editor of the <i>Felleisen.</i> You must address your letter: 'Redaktion des <i>Felleisen.</i> Deutscher Arbeiterbildungsverein, in Gassen, Zürich'.</p>
<p><i>Jules Favre</i></p>
<p>The infamous decree of 27th June 1848, by which many thousand Parisian workmen made prisoners during the June Insurrection,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> were, without even the formality of any judicial inquiry, to be <i>transported</i> to Algeria, etc., was drawn up by Jules Favre. Afterwards, he constantly refused to join the motions of amnesty, brought forward from time to time by the Republican party of the Constituent Assembly.</p>
<p>Jules Favre was one of the most notorious tools of the <i>reign of terror</i> inflicted on the French working class by General Cavaignac after the Insurrection of June. He supported all the shameless laws then passed with a view to suppress the right of reunion, coalition, and the freedom of the press.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>On the 16th April 1849, Jules Favre, as the spokesman of the counterrevolutionary majority of a parliamentary committee, proposed to grant Louis Bonaparte the 1,200,000 francs he demanded for the <i>expedition against the Roman Republic.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> </p>

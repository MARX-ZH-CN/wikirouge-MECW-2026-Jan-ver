ENGELS TO MARX<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 7 January 1868</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Herewith returned the <i>Dühring</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and the <i>Beobachter</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> The former is highly amusing. The whole article is embarrassment and FUNK. You can see that the worthy vulgar economist is <i>frappé au vif</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> and can find nothing to say except that it will only be possible to judge the first volume when the 3rd has come out,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> that determination of value by labour time is not undisputed, and that there are people who have some modest doubts about the determination of the value of labour on the basis of its costs of production. You see that for this genus<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> you are by no means learned enough, for you have not confuted the great Macleod<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> on the decisive point. At the same time, there is the fear in every line that he may be exposed to a treatment à <i>la</i> Roscher.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> The fellow was happy when he had finished the thing, but I am sure he carried it to the post with a heavy heart.</p>
<p>Kugelmann and Wilhelmchen<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> I shall return tomorrow. If there is anything in the copied letter from Lieutenant-Colonel Seubert which could be useful to me for a further Swabian article,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> please enclose it.</p>
<p>I could do something for Vienna too. Richter could perhaps be asked about the <i>Internationale Revue,</i> he is supposed to know the situation there.</p>
<p>Wilhelmchen's PAPER<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> is just too lovely—everything ready except the security bond, and so it cannot be published. Incidentally, if Wilhelm should go to Vienna then the fuss about the Austrian agent would really get going.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>How are things with Beesly, Lewes &amp; Co. and the <i>Fortnightly Review?</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Best greetings to the LADIES and the Doctor <i>amorosus.</i><sup>h</sup></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

Seubert promised his assistance in getting the reviews published in such newspapers as<i> Der Beobachter, Staats-Anzeiger für Württemberg </i> and<i> Schwäbischer Merkur.</i> For the first two Engels wrote reviews.</span>

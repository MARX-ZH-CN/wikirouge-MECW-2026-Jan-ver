<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">This is a short record of a reply to Hermann Ramm's letter to Engels of 7 February 1875. Ramm wrote that the<i> Volksstaat</i> publishers planned to purchase a plot of land to build new premises for the party printing office in Leipzig and requested Engels to help collect the necessary funds. This plan is also mentioned in Engels' letter to August Bebel of 15 October 1875 (see this volume, pp. 123-25).</span>

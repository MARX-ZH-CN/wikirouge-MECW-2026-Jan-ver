MARX TO SIGFRID MEYER</p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>London, 2 September 1870
1 Maitland Park Road, Haverstock Hill</p>
<p>Dear Meyer,</p>
<p>Just a few lines in great haste (if I am to catch die post). I shall write to you more fully next week. I came back yesterday from the seaside where the doctors had sent me for my health<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> but where a violent and painful attack of SCIATICA bent me double for weeks on end.</p>
<p>The first thing I did on my return was to reply to a pile of letters waiting for me; among my letter-creditors was Sorge, with half a dozen letters. <i>Your</i> letter had been mislaid and I only received it after sending off my reply to Sorge,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> so I was unable to modify that in the light of the information contained in your letter.*<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>In any case I simply had to write to Sorge because he had sent me newspapers and <i>LABOR STATISTICS</i> (Massachusetts),<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> ditto information about Hume of use to the General Council, together with 2 SAMPLES of the International cards, etc., he had produced.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> Lastly, I could not under any circumstances permit friend Vogt's erroneous view of <i>Schily</i>—one of my oldest and most intimate friends—to stand uncorrected.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>I was delighted to see from Sorge's last letter that you were being sent as a delegate to Cincinnati.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>If the German Workers' Union has nominated other correspondents this FACT should be reported to me <i>officially</i> for communication to the General Council.</p>
<p><i>Salut et fraternité.</i></p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>Could you give me any further information, such as the relevant acts of Congress, etc., about the economics of the railroad in the West?

However, passing himself off as an organiser of the International, Cluseret ignored the already existing sections in the USA and went beyond his brief. Several sections, including Section No. 1 (see Note 354), protested at Cluseret's behaviour and contacted the General Council, Johann Philipp Becker and Eugene Varlin with an inquiry about the powers granted to Cluseret. Marx replied to the inquiry in his letter to Sigfrid Meyer and August Vogt of 9 April 1870 (see present edition, Vol. 43).</span>

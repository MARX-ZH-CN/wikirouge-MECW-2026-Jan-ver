<br>A report dated Paris, February 25 in No. 51 of the <em>Kölnische Zeitung</em> includes the following item à propos of the so-called Franco-German conspiracy:

<blockquote><br>"Several of the accused, who have fled, among them a certain A. Majer, who is described as an agent <em>of</em> Marx and <em>his confederates...</em>"</blockquote>
<br>The falsehood of this assertion, which generously accords me not only "confederates" but an "agent" as well, is proved by the following facts: A. Majer, one of the most intimate friends of Herr K. Schapper and the former Prussian lieutenant Willich, acted as book-keeper to the Refugee Committee headed by them. I learned of the departure from London of this personage, who is a complete stranger to me, from a letter written by a friend [probably Ernst Dronke] in Geneva in which he reported that a certain A. Majer was purveying the most absurd gossip about me. Finally I read in French newspapers that this A. Majer is a "politician".

<p><i>To Jenny and Laura Marx in London</i></p>
<p><b>Manchester, 11 May 1858</b></p>
<p>Dear Jenny and Laura,</p>
<p>I cannot allow this note to go off to your mama without thanking you for the two lovely portraits which you asked Moor to bring me. They have found a temporary home on the <b>chimney-piece</b> in front of the looking-glass, but in a day or two will be given a splendid place of their own on the wall.</p>
<p>I hope Mr Schleiden['s book] suits you all right; the man's far more solemn than you are, and I only hope you won't see fit to imitate him.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I see with pleasure from your portraits that you have both grown a lot and that, although you are now grown-up young girls, your faces are still as frank and artless as of old; and you must believe me still to be your old [in Italian]
</p>
</blockquote>

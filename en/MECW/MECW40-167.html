<p><i>To Jenny Marx in London</i></p>
<p><b>Manchester, 11 May 1858</b></p>
<p>Dear Mrs Marx,</p>
<p>Moor has been out riding for two hours today and feels so well after it that he's waxing quite enthusiastic about the thing. He has left town and gone home, and has asked me to drop you a line about that fool <b>Cluss</b>. He thinks it might be a good thing for you to go and see Pfänder, who would probably elicit something from him. The main thing is that Monsieur Cluss should <i>come up here,</i> for we have got to know how we stand with him, and either he must declare himself <b>in a satisfactory manner</b> or else we must break with him. What good is the ass to us if he's so unreliable as first to come to you, his heart brimful and overflowing, stay for 3 hours with no other apparent object than to get back on to the old footing again, and then suddenly write you a letter as confused as it is ill-bred in which he retracts? We're only sorry that, in the midst of what is a far from rosy spell, such dolts should come and add to <i>your</i> troubles.</p>
<p>If at all possible, see that the man comes up here so that we at least have the satisfaction of telling him exactly what we think of him.</p>
<p>I hope that Moor will persevere with his riding, for if he does he'll be able to write again in a week. Lupus' leg is much better too.</p>
<p>Your devoted<br>F. Engels

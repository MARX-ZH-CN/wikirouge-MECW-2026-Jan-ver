ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 21 March 1870</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>Your letter of the day before yesterday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>was <i>only</i> delivered to me <i>today,</i> and the state of the envelope (enclosed) leaves no further doubt that the scoundrel Bruce is keeping an eye on our correspondence. I am, therefore, <i>not</i> sending these lines by post and, at the same time, a few lines, in which Pigott's letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>is returned, are going off to you by post.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Close your envelopes carefully, and seal them with sealing-wax <i>over</i> the glue so that the signet-print touches <i>all four flaps</i> of the envelope. Your present envelopes are not suitable; the 4 flaps have to come quite close together so that this can be done. This makes things more difficult, so that, in the short time the fellows have they are forced to leave visible evidence, and then one can denounce them publicly. In the meantime, write <i>important things</i> to me under the address: Schorlemmer, Owens College, Manchester, or 172 Brunswick Street, Manchester, or S. Moore, 25 Dover Street, Oxford Street, Manchester, and don't write the address yourself. For <i>very secret</i> things, the best way is some sort of packet per Globe Parcel Co. like this one. In this way you could also let me have another address; it must <i>not</i> be that of your house. It's a good thing that I am soon moving to London, then this will come to an end. I have just given notice on my house. In fact, the beastly government could wish for no better medium than our correspondence in order to keep informed of the activities of the entire proletarian party; the government will also find things in our correspondence that they can utilise with their continental colleagues. At least because of this we must take all precautions. We must not correspond for Stieber's sake.</p>
<p>Jenny can shout: <i>victoire sur toute la ligne!</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>If it were not for her, the honourable Gladstone would <i>never</i> have granted the new <i>enquête</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>How Moore<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>allowed himself to be diddled again by Gladstone concerning this enquiry can be shown by comparing the hopeful NOTE on p. 608 of <i>The Irishman</i>, which obviously proceeds from Moore, with Gladstone's Thursday speech, in which he reserved for himself the composition, procedures, etc.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>An attempt was also made, probably in Cologne, to open the letter from Solingen<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>to me, but it was unsuccessful, owing to proper use of sealing-wax.</p>
<p>Hearty greetings.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p>In their haste, the fellows laid together the four flaps of the envelope <i>incorrectly,</i> the proof is therefore absolute.

<li id="cite_note-7"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-7">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">After three of Jenny Marx's articles on the treatment of the Irish political prisoners in English prisons were published in<i> La Marseillaise</i> (see present edition, Vol. 21), the Irish M. P. George Henry Moore demanded, on 17 March 1870, that the Government launch a 'full and free' public inquiry into the matter. Under pressure from public opinion, Gladstone was forced, when replying to Moore, to agree to such an inquiry, but made a significant stipulation as to the character of the commission, stating that he 'shall be responsible for the manner in which the inquiry is conducted'. Thus Gladstone secured the right to appoint not a Parliamentary but a Royal commission which would not be accountable to Parliament. Moore's inquiry and Gladstone's reply were published in<i> The Times</i> on 18 March; on 19 March, in the column 'Treatment of Political Prisoners' and under the heading 'Probable Inquiry',<i> The  Irishman</i> featured the item (mentioned by Engels) which, contrary to what Gladstone had stated, said that a Parliamentary commission was to be appointed.</span>

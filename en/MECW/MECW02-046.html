<p>I will not fail to draw the attention of the Catholic nobly-born members of the knighthood to a poem which, though written by a commoner, is perhaps for this very reason the more worthy of being preserved as a precious pearl, as a due tribute of bourgeois humility.</p>
<p>In the year of grace eighteen hundred and forty-two a booklet appeared in Erfurt published by F. W. Otto: <em>Das Wissemwürdigste der Heraldik oder Wappenhunde</em> by F. W. Andrea, with a dedication which reads as follows: "Respectfully dedicated to the entire high nobility of Germany, by the publisher."
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Aristocracy by Right are loftiest in the Land,</p>
<p>The Virtues of Their Forebears always ranked full high.</p>
<p>Hereditary Worth has waxed and multiplied,</p>
<p>In no way doth the Present yield before the Past.</p>
<p>Thus Reverence greets Them humbly everywhere They go,</p>
<p>On every State the richest blessings They bestow.</p>
<p>"A Coat of Arms conceals a Wealth of hidden Meaning,</p>
<p>How the sublimest Deeds were done in ancient Times;</p>
<p>How Sovereigns gave the Nobles all Their just Deserts</p>
<p>In War as well as in the palmy Days of Peace.</p>
<p>Thus, Coats of Arms as high as Royal Crowns are rated:</p>
<p>Only exalted Deeds are therewith consecrated.</p>
<p>"With all Humility and Deference deeply felt</p>
<p>For Glory thus resplendent down the Aeons of Time,</p>
<p>I dedicate this Monument of Reverence</p>
<p>To the most lofty Scions of Virtue-breeding stock.</p>
<p>Pray, of a great Intention take this feeble token;</p>
<p>It might yet tell you what lay in my heart unspoken."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does the man not deserve to be knighted?

<br>I will not fail to draw the attention of the Catholic nobly-born members of the knighthood to a poem which, though written by a commoner, is perhaps for this very reason the more worthy of being preserved as a precious pearl, as a due tribute of bourgeois humility.
<br>In the year of grace eighteen hundred and forty-two a booklet appeared in Erfurt published by F. W. Otto: <em>Das Wissemwürdigste der Heraldik oder Wappenhunde</em> by F. W. Andrea, with a dedication which reads as follows: "Respectfully dedicated to the entire high nobility of Germany, by the publisher."

<blockquote>
<br>"The Aristocracy by Right are loftiest in the Land,
<br>The Virtues of Their Forebears always ranked full high.
<br>Hereditary Worth has waxed and multiplied,
<br>In no way doth the Present yield before the Past.
<br>Thus Reverence greets Them humbly everywhere They go,
<br>On every State the richest blessings They bestow.
<br>"A Coat of Arms conceals a Wealth of hidden Meaning,
<br>How the sublimest Deeds were done in ancient Times;
<br>How Sovereigns gave the Nobles all Their just Deserts
<br>In War as well as in the palmy Days of Peace.
<br>Thus, Coats of Arms as high as Royal Crowns are rated:
<br>Only exalted Deeds are therewith consecrated.
<br>"With all Humility and Deference deeply felt
<br>For Glory thus resplendent down the Aeons of Time,
<br>I dedicate this Monument of Reverence
<br>To the most lofty Scions of Virtue-breeding stock.
<br>Pray, of a great Intention take this feeble token;
<br>It might yet tell you what lay in my heart unspoken."

</blockquote>
<br>Does the man not deserve to be knighted?

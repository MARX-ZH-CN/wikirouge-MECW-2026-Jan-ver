<p>Dear Fred,</p>
<p>Best thanks for £20.</p>
<p>Letter from Dr Kugelmann enclosed.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>At this moment, I can write you but a few lines at this moment, as the landlord's agent is here and I must play opposite him in the role of Mercadet in Balzac's comedy.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>Apropos of Balzac, I advise you to read his <i>Le Chef-d'Œuvre Inconnu</i> and <i>Melmoth reconcilie.</i> They are two little <i>chefs d'œuvres</i> full of delightful irony.</p>
<p>Salut</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

Sending the text of his refutation ('<a href="MECW20-033.html">A Correction</a>') Marx considered its publication all the more necessary since he did plan to visit Germany to take the manuscript of Volume One of Capital to the publisher Otto Meissner in Hamburg and to agree about the terms of its publication.<br>On 21 February 1867 the Zeitung für Norddeutschland was forced to print a refutation of its fabrication about Marx's intention to take an active part in the preparations for a future insurrection in Poland. On 22 February Kugelmann sent the published refutation to Marx. This was probably what Marx told Engels in his letter of 25 February.</span>

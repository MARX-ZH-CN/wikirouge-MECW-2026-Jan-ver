ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN MARGATE</p>
<p>Manchester, 27 March 1866</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>I had just made up my mind to write you a letter of congratulations on what I inferred from your silence to be your<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> conscientious abstinence from work, when your letter arrived. It reassured me not a little, as I was beginning to suspect that another carbuncle might be the reason for your obstinate silence. You must keep taking plenty of exercise and continue visiting the archbishop in Canterbury <i>per pedes,</i> that is the sure way to eradicate it once and for all. In this case, and in others, too, the most important thing is to endure the boredom of the seaside for long enough; if you can, you should stay there for the whole of April, so that the trouble can be completely cured.</p>
<p>Old Hill has just come and interrupted me. So I must break off for today. The £10 encl.</p>
<p>E/T 96963, Manchester, 20 January 1865.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. Engels

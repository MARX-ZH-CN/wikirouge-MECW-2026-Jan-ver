ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 22 May 1852</p>
<p>Dear Marx,</p>
<p>I am writing to you today simply to make sure you know that yesterday I sent direct to you by the first post 1/2 a £10 note, and that the 2nd half went off at the same time under cover to Lupus for transmission to you. I trust you have received it all right.</p>

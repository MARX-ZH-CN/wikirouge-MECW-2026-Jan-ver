ENGELS TO NIKOLAI DANIELSON<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN ST PETERSBURG</p>
<p>London, 4 July 1889</p>
<p>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>I communicated to Mr Lafargue and to Mr Kautsky<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>what you were kind enough to say as to their articles published in the <i>Northern Review.</i> Mr Lafargue, in consequence of this, has sent me an article on the Evolution of Property<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>which he wishes me to forward to you and to request you to be good enough to offer it to the Editor of the <i>Northern Review"</i> on the usual terms as to honorarium etc. I forward it to you today by Book Post, <i>registered.</i></p>
<p>The news you are enabled to give us about the state of Mr M[utual]'s<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>health are very cheering, and in full agreement with what we heard from other sources.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>A man with such a tremendous constitution is sure to pull through and one fine morning we may hope to see him here again restored to full youthful health.</p>
<p>The third volume<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>has lain fallow for the last three months in consequence of various unavoidable circumstances, and as the summer season is always a very idle time, I am afraid I shall not be able to do much at it before September or October. The section on Banks and Credit offers considerable difficulties. The leading principles are announced clearly enough, but the whole context is such that it presupposes the reader to be well acquainted with the chief works of literature on the subject such as Tooke<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>and Fullerton,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>and as this is not the case generally, it will require a deal of explanatory notes, etc.</p>
<p>By the way I have a second copy of Fullerton's <i>Regulation of Currencies,</i> the chief work on the question; if you have not got the book I shall be most happy if you will allow me to send it to you.</p>
<p>The last section 'on rent of land' will, as far as I recollect, require but formal revision, so that, the Bank and Credit section once finished (it is 1/3 of the whole), the last third (Rent, and the different classes of revenue) will not take long. But as this crowning volume is such a splendid and totally unanswerable work, I consider myself bound to bring it out in a shape in which the whole line of argument stands forth clearly and in bold relief. And with the state of this Ms.—a mere first sketch, often interrupted, and left incomplete—that is not so very easy.</p>
<p>I am trying to make arrangements to have two competent gentlemen<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>to copy out for me the elements of the fourth volume from the Ms. which my eyes will hardly allow me to dictate. If I succeed in this, I shall also have trained them to the deciphering of these manuscripts which at present are a sealed book to everyone except myself who am used to the handwriting and abbreviations, and thus the author's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>other manuscripts will remain available, quite independent of my life and death. I expect that these arrangements too may be concluded this next autumn.</p>
<p>Yours very faithfully</p>
<p>P. W. Rosher<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The English translator of the greater part of Volume I Mr Moore has just left for Africa, having been appointed Chief Justice of the Territories of the Niger Company. Thus the 3rd volume will be translated, in part at least, at the banks of the Niger!

<p><i>To Engels in Manchester</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 2 February 1859</b></p>
<p><b>Dear</b> Frederick,</p>
<p>The <i>Constitutionnel</i> wins since, according to <i>The Times</i>, the author was none other than Mr Boustrapa.</p>
<p>Today came a letter (which I'll send you later) from Lassalle saying that the manuscript has <i>not yet</i> arrived. Now take note: It went off on Tuesday (25); I was notified as early as <i>30th</i> January by the <b>packet company</b> here that the manuscript had arrived in Berlin. Lassalle's letter is dated 31 January. <i>Hence</i> the government has been <i>holding back</i> my manuscript for 3 or 4 days at least (if Duncker got the manuscript <i>after</i> Lassalle's letter went off). Maybe Mr Stieber has been rummaging through it, or Mr von Patow has been endeavouring to make a hasty acquaintance with economics.</p>
<p>Wrote to Lassalle straight off. <i>Your philistines</i> have intercepted the stuff you were sending me (for Tuesday). It didn't arrive. I waited until 3 in the afternoon. Then I dashed off another article.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i>.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.

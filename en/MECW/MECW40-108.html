ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 17 November 1857</p>
<p>7 South gate</p>
<p>Dear Marx,</p>
<p>I doubt whether yesterday's article<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>reached you soon enough. When I went to the post it had just turned midnight and the BOX was closed, so I dropped it in the EXTRA BOX, which means it must have left here at 9.15 this morning and arrived in London at 3.45, hence been delivered to you at about 6 o'clock.</p>
<p>About a month ago there was a share CRASH in Vienna, on which occasion 105 houses are said to have failed there to the tune of Fl. 14,000,000, or £1,400,000.</p>
<p>Nothing has been done here today. Tomorrow you will receive a whole bundle of <i>Guardians</i> and also some money from me, I hope.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

ENGELS TO FILIPPO TURATI</p>
<p>IN MILAN</p>
<p>London, 11 May 1894<br>
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>My dear Turati,</p>
<p>I am returning to you, <i>registered Post,</i> the proofs of <i>Libero Scambio, etc.,</i> together with the English edition, 358 which I would ask you to keep. The translation of my introduction is very good, except for a few points that are technically difficult—you will find the appropriate indications. However, Marx's speech, which is published in the <i>Critica Sociale,</i> is not a translation but a <i>summary 364</i> that I despair of setting in order. I have written again to Paris 25 to ask them to send you the French original. In the meantime please compare with the English text. If you publish the text according to <i>Critica Sociale,</i> you will receive complaints that this is not the author's text, that this is to take liberties which are tantamount to <i>forgery,</i> etc., and unfortunately I will find it impossible to come to your aid, It would be better to rewrite it—it is not very long—than to expose oneself to such complaints.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Engels</p>
<p>Greetings to Mme Anna Kulishov and you from Louise Kautsky- Freyberger and myself.

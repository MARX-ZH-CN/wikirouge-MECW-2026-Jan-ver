<p>TO JOSEPH WEYDEMEYER IN FRANKFURT AM MAIN</p>
<p><br>
London, 4 February 1850</p>
<p>Dear Weydemeyer,</p>
<p>The reason for your getting such a late reply to your letter is that I was seriously ill for a fortnight.</p>
<p>The <i>Revue</i> will be appearing next week. Your article will be in it. We are awaiting the continuation.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The publication of the periodical was delayed through my illness. Actually we had arranged it so that two issues should appear simultaneously but the publisher<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> was opposed to this out of commercial considerations which we thought correct. So a further change was necessary and this happened to coincide with my unlucky illness.</p>
<p>You will receive 100 copies from Cologne. Please send two of them to C. Biringer in Höchst near Frankfurt. He ordered them from here. You will probably undertake to get payment for them.</p>
<p>I have passed on your message to Teilering. The fellow is quite unsuited to be an English correspondent. In Vienna it was alright for him to bluster. Here you have to study matters. More another time.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. Marx</p>
<p>
Best regards to your wife<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> from my wife and self. In Hamburg about 1,500 copies have already been ordered.</p><div class="mw-references-wrap"><ol class="references">

Politisch-ökonomische Revue</i> was never realised. About mid-January Weydemeyer wrote his first article 'From South Germany' but it was not published in the first issue of the <i>Revue</i> owing to lack of space, and later lost its topical interest.</span>

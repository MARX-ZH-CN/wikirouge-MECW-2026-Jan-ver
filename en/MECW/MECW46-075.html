<h4 class="mw-headline" id=".5BDraft.5D_Bridlington_Quay.2C_15_August_1881">[Draft] Bridlington Quay, 15 August 1881</h4><a id="[Draft]_Bridlington_Quay,_15_August_1881"></a>
<br>Dear Mr. Shipton,
<br>I cannot make it out, how you could so strangely misunderstand Mr Kautsky's article.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> To the first passage you objected because State interference went against the grain of 'many prominent men in the Unions'. Of course it does, because they are at heart Manchester School<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> men and so long as their opinions of such are taken into account, no working-class paper is possible. But my addition to the passage in question must have convinced you, that the State interference here alluded to, was such, and such only, as has been in England the Law of the Land for years: factories and workshops' acts,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> and nothing further: things not objected to by even your 'prominent men'.
<br>As to the second passage, Mr Kautsky says: an international regulation of the <em>war of competition is</em> as necessary as that of <em>open warfare;</em> we demand a <em>Geneva Convention</em><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> for the workpeople of the world. The 'Geneva Convention' is an <em>agreement</em> entered into by the various <em>Governments</em> for the protection of wounded and ambulances in battle. What therefore Mr Kautsky demands, is a similar agreement between the various <em>Governments</em> for the protection of the workpeople not of one state only, but of all, against overwork especially of women and children. How out of that you can make an appeal to the <em>workpeople</em> of the world to <em>meet in a Convention of delegates at Geneva</em>, I am utterly at a loss to understand.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> <br>You will own that the occurrence of such misunderstanding on your part cannot at all encourage me to alter my resolution.
<br>As to the Hirsch article,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> I do know Mr. Eccarius and only too well for a traitor to the cause and it will be utterly impossible for me to write for a paper which opens its columns to him.
<br>Moreover, I do not see any progress. <em>The Labour Standard</em> remains the same vehicle of the most various and mutually contradictory views on all political and social questions which it was, perhaps unavoidably, on the first day of its existence, but which it ought no longer to be by this time, if there was an undercurrent among the British working class tending towards emancipation from the liberal Capitalists. Such undercurrent not being shown itself up to now, I must conclude it does not exist. If there were unmistakable signs of its existence, I might make an extra effort to assist it. But I do not think that one column a week drowned as I might say amongst the remaining multifarious opinions represented in <em>The Labour Standard</em> could do anything towards producing it.
<br>And as I told you, I had resolved to stop writing after the Trade Unions Congress,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> because of want of time; so whether I write a few articles more till then, would make no difference.
<br>So waiting and hoping for better times, I remain<br>Faithfully yours,
<br>F. E.

Especially to those of England who, besides the Swiss, are the best protected of all against overworking and therefore are exposed to an unfair competition on the part of Belgian, French and German workpeople whose hours of work are much longer.</span>

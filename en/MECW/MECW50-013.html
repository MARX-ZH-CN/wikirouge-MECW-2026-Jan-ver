ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE</p>
<p>AT LE PERREUX</p>
<p>London, 4 November 1892</p>
<p>My dear Löhr,</p>
<p>This morning Meissner sends a remittance for £38—one-third of which <i>£12.13.4d.,</i> covers your share and is settled by enclosed cheque which please acknowledge. There are about 400 copies left of Vol. I and the second edition is in preparation. Fourth edition of Vol. I is out, and 460 copies sold, which wipe off the greater part of the printing etc. cost; only 886 Marks remain to be covered and all the receipts beyond that will be profits to be divided with Meissner.</p>
<p>Third Volume<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> well in hand and will not leave off until finished. This cannot be done unless I neglect correspondence, so you must excuse my brevity.</p>
<p>Now you ought to take seriously into consideration your impending visit to London; we have talked so much about it that at last it ought to be put into execution. We all should be so glad to see you here again once more.</p>
<p>I am in daily expectation of news that Pumps has had another baby. It's fully due if not overdue, she herself expected it a month ago, but she is always out of her reckoning.</p>
<p>I wonder whether Jack Burns did say the nonsense about the foreign working men, Huret puts into his mouth in the <i>Figaro?</i></p>
<p>Now then, to work again! The day I finish that section on Banks and Credit, which has been my stumbling block for 4-5 Years (because under 3 months of <i>absolutely free</i> time it can't be done and these 3 months I could not get)—the day I finish that, there will be some consumption of alcohol—you bet!</p>
<p>Love from Louise.</p>
<p>Ever yours,</p>
<p>F. Engels

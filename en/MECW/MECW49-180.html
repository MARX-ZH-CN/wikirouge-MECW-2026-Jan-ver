<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">On 2 February 1892 Filippo Turati sent Engels an article by the Italian philosopher and political leader Giovanni Bovio published in <i>La Tribuna.</i> The article contained a critique of the first instalment of Engels' 'Socialism in Germany' (see present edition, Vol. 27, pp. 235-50) as printed by Turati in the socialist journal <i>Critica Sociale,</i> No. 2, 16 January 1892. Turati, editor of the journal, reproduced Engels' work in translation from its French version published in <i>Almanack du Parti Ouvrier.</i> Turati requested Engels to reply to Bovio's article. Engels wrote his counterblast in French (see 'Reply to the Honourable Giovanni Bovio', present edition, Vol. 27, pp. 270-72) and sent it with a covering letter to Turati. Turati's Italian translation of Engels' reply, endorsed by the latter in a letter to Turati of 13 February (see this volume, p. 356), was published in <i>Critica Sociale,</i> No. 4, 16 February 1892 under the title 'Federico Engels — Giovanni Bovio' and was reprinted by several Italian newspapers.</span>

<p>To Messrs. Adam, Barthelemy and Vidil</p>
<p>Gentlemen,</p>
<p>We have the honour of informing you that we have, long since, considered the association you speak of [the Universal Society of Revolutionary Communists, launched by Willich and Schapper and the Blanquist refugees with a document signed in mid-April 1850] as dissolved by fact. The only thing remaining to be done would be the destruction of the fundamental contract. Perhaps Mr. Adam or Mr. Vidil will have the kindness to call on Sunday next October 13th at noon, on Mr. Engels at Nr. 6, Macclesfield Street Soho, in order to witness the burning of the same.</p>
<p>We have the honour to be, Gentlemen,<br>your most obedient servants,</p>
<p>Engels, Marx, Harney</p>
<p>London, October 9th, 1850

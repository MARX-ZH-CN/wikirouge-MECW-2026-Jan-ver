TO FERDINAND FREILIGRATH IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester, not later than 25 February 1857]</p>
<p>...The only literary piece of Weerth's that has arrived here so far is a humoristic history of trade (a fragment from the Brussels-Bradford period, 1845-47),<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> but Steinthal is expecting a further packing case of papers. I shall most willingly do all I can to get the things, but it is important that Weerth's brother<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> should write a letter for me, so that I shall have some kind of authorisation. There should hardly be much difficulty; Steinthal is perfectly willing to help. But as regards details probably more than one point of disagreement will crop up.</p>
<p>The diaries, as far as my knowledge of them from Weerth's last stay here goes, contain only matter-of-fact notes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as I have already said, as soon as I am authorised to collect the things, I shall certainly make sure that I get everything....

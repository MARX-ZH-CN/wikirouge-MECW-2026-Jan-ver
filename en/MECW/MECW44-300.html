MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Manchester,] 25 May 1873</p>
<p>Dear FRED,</p>
<p>I am quickly writing these few lines in reply in Schorlemmer's room. I am just on the point of going for a walk with him since Moore<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>is with his Dulcinea and only intends to reappear at ABOUT</p>
<p>6 O'CLOCK. It was damnably cold here with an easterly wind until today, so that I have caught a cold <i>in optima forma.</i></p>
<p>The same day, or rather evening, as I arrived, the first person I encountered was, as usual, the inevitable Borchardt.</p>
<p>Yesterday I also met the worthy Knowles, very boozy, with a reddish complexion.</p>
<p>BRAVE Dakyns, I learn from Moore, will have nothing more to do with the International because it has split.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>I would be grateful if you could give the £50 to my wife. <i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>Schorlemmer sends his regards and says—alluding to your letter to Gumpert<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>—that he has been confirmed once again in his belief that you are a great strategist.

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">After the Hague Congress the reformist wing of the British Federal Council refused to recognise the Congress resolutions. To counter the reformists' actions, the revolutionary wing of the Council (Samuel Vickery, William Riley, George Milner, Frederick Lessner, Eugène Dupont and others) vigorously supported Marx and Engels. In early December 1872 a split occurred; the wing of the Council that remained loyal to the Hague Congress resolutions was established as the British Federal Council in late December 1872.<br>The British Federal Council existed until early 1874.</span>

<br><i>To Engels in Manchester</i>
<br><b>[London,] 14 November 1864</b>
<br>Dear Engels,
<br>I have had to stay mainly <em>in bed</em> for almost a week on account of the carbuncle. The thing is now <em>healing up.</em> However, as the carbuncle is just below the breast, I still have trouble leaning forward in order to write. So, to keep it as brief as possible:
<br>1. Please send the <em>enclosed</em> letters addressed to me back to me (both the one from Schweitzer and the one from Liebknecht) and reply <em>by return,</em> as the people need our reply as soon as possible.
<br>My view is that we should <em>promise</em> occasional contributions from time to time. It is important for us to have a mouthpiece in Berlin, especially for the sake of the association I was involved in founding in London, and for the sake of the book [Capital] I am planning to publish. It is also important that whatever we do, we do it <em>together.</em>
<br>If you agree with me, you can <em>send</em> me a few lines for these chaps, or say in a few lines what statement <em>I</em> am to make in your name.
<br>2. You will receive the '<b>Address'</b> along with the '<b>Provisional Rules'</b> etc., in a few days. The thing was not quite so difficult as you think, because we are dealing with 'workers' all the time. The only <b>literary man</b> in the Association is the Englishman, Peter Fox, a writer and <b>agitator</b> who is, at the same time, one of the people from <em>The National Reformer</em> (atheist but anti-Holyoake). I am sending you the very kind note he passed on to me concerning the '<b>Address'.</b> Mazzini is <b>rather disgusted</b> that his people are among the signatories, <em>mais il faut faire bonne mine a mauvais jeu</em> [one has to grin and bear it]<em>.</em>
<br>3. Your stuff from the <em>Guardian</em> I find most valuable. I had already pieced this abomination together from the '<b>Factory Reports</b>', but only in a most laborious and fragmentary fashion.
<br>4. 2 <b>copies</b> received from the Manchester <b>solicitor</b> for signing, etc. In a day or two, I shall send you the signed copies, along with the list (inventory), etc., which you will then have to record. Of course, I can no longer reel off a complete list of all the stuff we left in the flat, etc., and put a value on it.
<br>That old <b>humbug</b> McCulloch has died. I hope the British Museum buys up his <b>economical library</b>. But no doubt Edinburgh will get in first.
<br><em>Salut.</em>
<br>Your<br>K. M.
<br>I have just come across P. Fox's letter, which I am enclosing; please send it back as soon as you have had time to peruse it.

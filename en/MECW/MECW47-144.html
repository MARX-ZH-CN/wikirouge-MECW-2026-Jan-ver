ENGELS TO HERMANN SCHLÜTER
<br>IN HOTTINGEN-ZURICH
<br>London, 1 January 1885
<br>Dear Mr Schlüter,
<br>I have received your esteemed note of the 10th as well as Mrs Kelley-Wischnewetzky's ms.<sup>349</sup> I have advised her of its receipt and told her I hope to be able to revise it next week.
<br><i>The Condition of the Working-Class</i> has not as yet been entirely prised out of Wigand's hands. From what Freytag the lawyer said, the old contract, which envisaged a second edition, was still in force about 10 years ago.<sup>40</sup> Since then I have on several occasions tried to find out from Freytag how I stood with Wigand under Saxon law but have never received an answer. So long as I remain in doubt on this point I shan't know what steps I can take. I have also told Dietz as much<sup>39</sup> but heard nothing further after that; he spoke of bringing out a new edition but I was not told anything definite.
<br>However a new edition would not be possible without various notes by me, which in turn would involve consulting sundry works of reference and, in places, call for study and this I cannot take on at the moment as I have more than enough to do. I might consider it towards the middle of the year. So I think the best thing would be simply to let the matter rest till then.
<br>Now, however, Ede tells me that my <i>Anti-Dühring</i> ought to be reprinted.<sup>208</sup> After considerable thought I have decided that it should be brought out <i>unaltered.</i> I owe this to my opponent and shall simply provide a new preface,<sup>a</sup> also appendices to some of the chapters, which can go together at the end. Then a new preface. This, too, I shall find time for. So if you want work for the press, I would suggest you start with that. Besides, the thing is not particularly urgent and can therefore be printed at your convenience.
<br>I hope to finish Marx's <i>Capital,</i> Book II, in January and then proceed at once to rewrite the <i>Peasant War.</i><sup>213</sup> That will take a good 6 weeks. But I must be quit of it so as to get on with <i>Capital,</i> Book III. To begin with, this will be a purely daytime occupation, leaving my evenings to some extent free, when I can attend to the <i>Condition of the Working-Class</i> — if, that is, the revision of sundry translations, attending to proofs, etc., leaves me time for it.
<br>So think the matter over and let me know what you have decided. I shall gladly do all I can to help you.
<br>Kindest regards and a Happy New Year to the colony at large.
<br>Yours,
<br>F. Engels

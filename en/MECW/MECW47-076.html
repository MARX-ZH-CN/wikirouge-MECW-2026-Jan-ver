ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>London, 18 April 1884</p>
<p>My dear Paul,</p>
<p>A quarter to 5 — so must hurry! My congratulations on the success of your Congress,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> a success that is evident from the different way in which the earlier and later meetings are reported in the <i>Journal de Roubaix.</i> The Germans did right in not sending a delegate, for had they done so it would have unduly facilitated the further retention of the Exceptional Law by the government and the bourgeoisie; the <i>moderates</i> in our party (very numerous among the leaders, very few among the masses, who are first-rate) would have exploited this; such a mistake would have been impermissible. In cases of this kind, demonstrations, even international ones, must be foregone.</p>
<p>When shall I get back the ms. of the translation?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> This time you really must try harder, I beg of you. It is essential that the thing should either be done well or not at all. And when will it be possible to begin printing? I ask this so that I can make arrangements to write a few notes and a short preface<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> —if you like you can do a preface and send it to me here. You asked that you be given precedence over the German edition; but I have got a complete ms. of the first part of the latter and the Zurich people will begin printing the moment a manuscript reaches them.</p>
<p>What with this German text and the English <i>Capital</i> to revise,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> my hands are full, and accordingly I wish to know how to arrange things so as to avoid unnecessary loss of time. For it's essential that I get down to the 2nd volume<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> — and now Zurich has to inform me of the need for a 2nd edition of my <i>Anti-Dühring</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> and a 4th of the <i>Peasant War,</i> which means further revisions and further prefaces to be done! And that's what I — and Mr Bismarck — have gained from the banning of my books in Germany!</p>
<p>Old William<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> is more or less <i>in extremis</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> He no longer recognises those who come to see him, nor can he repeat the phrases he has been taught to say by rote in reply to deputations.</p>
<p>Nim has just come back from shopping, she sends you her <b>amours</b> (LOVES) and as much as you want of them.</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>F.E.</p>
<p><i>Twenty minutes past five.</i>

<li id="cite_note-4"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-4">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The idea of translating<i> Capital</i> into English occurred to Marx as early as 1865, when he was working on the manuscript (see Marx's letter to Engels of 31 July 1865, present edition, Vol. 42). The British journalist and member of the International's General Council, Peter Fox, was to help Marx find a publisher. However, this matter was not settled due to Fox's death in 1869. The English translation of the first volume of<i> Capital,</i> edited by Engels, did not appear until after Marx's death, in January 1887, and was published by Swan Sonnenschein, Lowrey &amp; Co., London. The translation was done by Samuel Moore and Edward Aveling between mid-1883 and March 1886. Eleanor Marx-Aveling took part in the preparatory work for the edition (see also this volume, pp. 33 and 127-28).</span>

The newspaper<i> Justice,</i> No. 11, 29 March 1884, reported that<i> To-Day</i> was about to publish Lafargue's article 'On Peasant Proprietary in France' and described the author as 'perhaps the greatest living authority on the French peasantry'.</span>

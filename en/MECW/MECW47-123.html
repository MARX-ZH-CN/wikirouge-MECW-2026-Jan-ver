ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN</p>
<p>IN ZURICH</p>
<p>London, 22 October 1884</p>
<p>Dear Ede,</p>
<p>I am laying aside my preface<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> to inform you:</p>
<p>1. That I am sending you herewith, by registered mail, Marx's 'Speech on the Question of Free Trade'. This irreplaceable copy, acquired with much difficulty at second-hand, must be returned to me after use.</p>
<p>2. That I consider it necessary to print in the form of an appendix at the end of the <i>Poverty</i> the passage from <i>A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</i> concerning <i>John Gray, the first precursor of Proudhon and Rodbertus,</i> from p. 61, 'the theory that labour time', etc., up to the end of the section on p. 64.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Would you be so kind as to send it to Stuttgart forthwith? I refer to this appendix in the preface. <i>Between us</i> we shall have <i>completely</i> demolished the whole of this aspect of petty-bourgeois socialism and disposed at the same time of the reply to Rodbertus' Utopia, for I shall use the preface to make good any other deficiencies.</p>
<p>Whether or not you use the <b>libre échange</b><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> as an appendix is for you to decide; I can't think where else to put it, and can hardly imagine it would be effective simply as a pamphlet — as to which you are better judges than I.</p>
<p>If Dietz should raise any difficulties regarding the Gray appendix, it might be included after the preface and the article on Proudhon from the <i>Social-Demokrat</i> (the old one). But included it must be, as you yourselves will find.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

The book included, in place of Marx's preface, his article 'On Proudhon' (see present edition, Vol. 20) and two appendices: an excerpt from Marx's work <i>A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</i> on the theory of the English socialist John Gray (see present edition, Vol. 29, pp. 320-23), and a translation of the 'Speech on the Question of Free Trade' (Vol. 6). At one time <i>Die Neue Zeit</i> was printed in a distinctive orthography proposed by Bruno Geiser.</span>

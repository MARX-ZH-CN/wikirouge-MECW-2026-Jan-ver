ENGELS TO JENNY LONGUET<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>IN OXFORD</p>
<p>London as usual, October 30th 1872</p>
<p>My dear Jenny,</p>
<p>You must consider me an awfully cruel individual to think that I should be capable to poison, by <i>malice prepensée,</i> even with one drop of vinegar, the sweetness of your honeymoon.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> If Mottershead or Guillaume said such a thing of me, I should not wonder, but you! Indeed I never thought that there was in one of the numbers that little <i>entrefilet</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> about a certain great man<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> whom I better not name, and if I had seen it I should have kept the number back or used Russian censorship to tease you a bit.</p>
<p>Your account of Oxford people only gives a sad confirmation to the sad fact that landladies are the same all the world over, indeed one does not know which are the worst, landladies or landlords. It's the difference of retail and wholesale which distinguishes the landlady of Stanhope House from the Marquis of Westminster,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> the principle is the same.</p>
<p>Now the Lafargues are here<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> and you no doubt now and then feel inclined to come over here, I hope you will recollect that there is always plenty of accommodation, both for you and for the Longuet of all Charlies, at our house, and he shall find a bed where he can stretch himself without laying crossways. And as I am on this subject, an idea strikes me. To-morrow night seven sharp we shall have the whole of your house, Lafargues and Ellen<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> and all, here for dinner, and would it not be a nice surprise if they found you here? I could not well write about this before, as the thing was only finally settled to-day, Mohr being so very uncertain on account of his hard work; but I know you're quite capable of making up your mind even to-morrow morning, and so I hope you will come. And as there are generally such things to be had as return tickets available for three or four days, you might stay a few days here, and perhaps Longuet finds time to come on Saturday to take you back on Sunday or Monday morning. If you leave by 2.30 train (if my old railway guide be still correct) you will be here in very good time, and indeed we might go across to Maitland Park<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> before dinner and see how they are getting on. I hope you will ruminate this suggestion to-morrow morning over breakfast and find it excellent.</p>
<p>As to the <i>purs, impurs</i> and <i>demipurs</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> I see very little of them, the <i>purs</i> are going to publish a pamphlet<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> containing all their grievances but it is still a mystery to me whether they will say much about us. At all events they are going to organise <i>une société indépendente où toute tendence anti-révolutionnaire serait exclue.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Last Sunday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> Mohr delivered a lecture before the <i>Knoten.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> I brought a German chemical manufacturer, friend of Schorlemmer's<sup>g</sup> ('not unlike your brothers, but otherwise a typically easy-going son of the Palatinate', as Schorlemmer described him in his unsealed letter!) who permitted himself one or two objections but was pretty well rebuffed by Lessner and a few other working men.</p>
<p>So I am counting on your innate energy to make a bold decision and come here tomorrow; that would be an enormous pleasure.</p>
<p>My wife<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14" id="cite_ref-14">[14]</a></sup> and Pumps<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15" id="cite_ref-15">[15]</a></sup> join me in sending you both our best wishes.</p>
<p>Your old</p>
<p>F. Engels</p>
<p>This page has, of course, been written in German especially for Longuet's benefit. Lafargue is quite good at German and could follow Mohr's lecture fairly well.

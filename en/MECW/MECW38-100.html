<p><i>To George Julian Harney in London</i>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accepting Marx's suggestion to move to London Engels had to go via Piedmont, as he risked being arrested in France and more so in Germany. On 5 October 1849 he arrived in Genoa, and on the following day left for England on a British schooner via Gibraltar and the Bay of Biscay. The voyage lasted nearly five weeks. About 12 November, Engels arrived in London as was reported in the item: 'London, 14. Nov.' by the <i>Westdeutsche Zeitung</i>, No. 154, 20 November 1849.</p>
<p>The English original of the present letter was first printed in the <i>Harney Papers</i> Assen, 1969.

<h4 class="mw-headline" id="ME38-100-2">Genoa, 5 October 1849</h4><a id="Genoa,_5_October_1849"></a>
<p>My dear Harney,</p>
<p>You will have got the few lines I sent you through Colonel Willich.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> This is to inform you, and by you Marx, that I am this morning arrived here in Genoa, and that, wind and weather favourable, I am going under sail for <i>London</i> to-morrow morning on board the English schooner Cornish Diamond, Capt-n <i>Stevens.</i> My journey will be of about 4 or 5 weeks so that by the middle of November I shall be in London.</p>
<p>I am very happy to have found so soon an opportunity of leaving this damned police atmosphere — indeed I never saw it so organised as here in Piedmont.</p>
<p>Ever truly thine<br>F. Engels

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 29 August 1860</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Is there still an opening for Eccarius with the tailor in Manchester? If so, he must leave here as he's fit for work again (he's still living out here), business in London is bad and he would, besides, have to go back to the sweatshop.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The wherewithal to send him up there with his FAMILY is heing procured down here.</p>
<p>For your information, I should tell you that I believe he is suffering from a disease of the spinal cord. His wife is a revolting creature, a curious amalgam of aspirations after respectability (CHURCHWARDENS DAUGHTER) and Irishness. Her housekeeping is sloven-</p>
<p>ly. As for him, his energy is of the passive kind—not at all active, particularly since the disease has grown worse. From the outset, therefore, he ought not to be cossetted in Manchester, should he come up there. For the thumbscrew will have to be applied to him, otherwise she will get ideas into her head.</p>
<p>I must have something about Garibaldi soon. That's the only thing that interests the Yankees.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Today a letter arrived from my Berlin lawyer<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>containing his petition to the Supreme Tribunal. You shall have it later. He himself hasn't properly grasped the point about the flysheet and Blind<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>; however, he's taken in the rest pretty well.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

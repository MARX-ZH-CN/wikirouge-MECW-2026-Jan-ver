ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>Manchester, 12 December 1855
<br>Dear Marx,
<br>Something can be arranged with the good <i>Tribune</i> people after all, you see, and the £200 are assured. So that a start can be made straight away, I shall do a military article this evening, then you must do a political one. Both of them can then go on Friday,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <i>hoc facit</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <i>£4</i>. I return Dana's letter herewith.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <i>Au fond</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> it is all to the good that the noble Mirbach has settled down to a life of idleness in London, for after all nothing has been definitely settled with the New Yorkers about the Crimean articles.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> At all events, I am now relieved of any indirect obligation to the chap, and <i>il ne me regarde plus</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> I have said nothing at all here about the matter, otherwise it would give Lupus qualms of conscience in the end, and next time he would turn rebellious.
<br>Jmeyer<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> wrote to me recently, not so much to inform me that he was still awaiting a letter from you, as to let me know what to say at my brother-in-law's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> at Christmas. He has heard nothing at all from the little man.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> <br>We shall bear in mind Mr Karl Joest and his caricatures. I believe I shall do an even better caricature of him when he is dangling from a lamp post.
<br>Whether I shall be able to do an article on Tuesday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> depends, of course, on events, which are now very few and far between. Kars and Omer Pasha will have to be my victims today; if anything happens tomorrow I shall add it on.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> <br>The STRIKE is going ahead here. The MASTERS said that they were willing to pay, provided the Ashton rates were taken as a basis. The HANDS replied that if the MASTERS chose Ashton, they would choose Oldham and be prepared to accept as a basis the average for the two places. Thereupon the MASTERS gave an evasive answer and proposed yet a third place in the district as a norm. This was refused and there the matter rests. The HANDS seem to me to be completely in the right; but they obviously still have in mind a few old trade union traditions whereby only this or that machine may be operated and only in the specific, time-honoured manner. But they'll soon drop this rubbish. The neighbourhood is beginning to support them.
<br>The editor of the <i>Guardian</i>, whom I've come to know, is a wise man IN HIS OWN MIND and a kind of oracle in the eyes of a number of philistines; apart from that a teller of dirty stories and a moderate carouser. He has obviously heard about me for, whenever I mention some shabby trick, he listens with attention and asks questions which show a desire to know. I shall gradually encourage the man's advances and then draw him out about the people on the <i>Examiner</i> <i>and</i> <i>Times</i>, after which I shall approach the latter rag. <i>Après, on avisera</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> <br>Warmest regards to your wife and children.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH LESSNER</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Brighton, 4 March 1877<br>
42 King's Road</p>
<p>Dear Lessner,</p>
<p>This morning I got a letter from Hoffmann, 9 Hayes Court, Soho, to whom I had already sent two pounds through you. One child died before Christmas, a second on 15 February and on 25 February he lost his wife; he asks me for help, since he has not yet paid off the funeral expenses for the child and doesn't know how he can meet those for his wife, who is to be buried today, and which amount to <i>£4.</i> The letter (of 28 February) remained in London unattended to and hence I couldn't do anything for him in time; moreover today is Sunday when no action can be taken. Will you be so good as to call on the man and see what can be arranged and how things are with him, and if you have a pound or 30s. at your disposal you could, depending on the cir- cumstances, give it to him on my behalf, or else write and tell me straight away what you think of the matter and I can send a POST OFFICE order. Above all make it clear to the man that I didn't get his letter until this morning and was therefore unable to do anything.</p>
<p>I had to bring my wife here so that she could recover somewhat from her debility and this she has managed to do; she is much</p>
<p><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>better and I trust she will remain so. We go back on Tuesday week,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and a day or two after that Pumps will also be returning, accompanied by Miss Lina Schöler.</p>
<p>My wife sends her warm regards to you and yours and also to Nelli, as does</p>
<p>Your old friend,</p>
<p>F. Engels

[London, about 17 July 1851]
28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Be so kind as to post enclosed letter for Schulz<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> in Manchester without delay.</p>
<p>Herewith you will find Freiligrath's letter to Ruge, which I would ask you to return, and Bermbach's letter to me. Also a letter from Miquel.</p>
<p>A certain 'Ulmer', a shoemaker, fled from Cologne at the time of the recent house searches. He gave a Straubinger<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> at Scharttner's a letter to take to his relations. Immediately afterwards this Straubinger was caught with the letter at the Dutch border. The only people to be compromised by this are those who set him free. So well organised are the police at the Scharttner place.</p>
<p>Weydemeyer has got across the border. We are expecting him here.</p>
<p>That wretched pair, Heinzen and Ruge, claim to have received all kinds of stupid tittle-tattle about the events in Cologne, allegedly from Germany. To judge by the total inaccuracy of the contents they are acting as their own correspondents.</p>
<p>Let me hear from you soon.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>P.S. It has just occurred to me that it would be better if you were to send the letter to Bermbach yourself. On the outside namely: Louis Schulz, 2 Schildergasse, Cologne. Inside, the sealed letter to Bermbach. Of course you will see to it that the inside address is quite invisible, and seal the letter as a merchant does.

Marx and Engels used this term for German artisans, including some participants in the working-class movement of that time, who were still largely swayed by guild prejudices and cherished the petty-bourgeois illusion that it was possible to return from capitalist large-scale industry to petty handicraft production.</span>

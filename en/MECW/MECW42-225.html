MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>Manchester [about 22 May 1867]<br>86 Mornington St.</p>
<p>Dear FRED,</p>
<p>Arrived in London Sunday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>Got here today.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>But:</p>
<p><i>Notice: with me</i> one H. Meyer from St Louis, whom I am about to collect from the railway REFRESHMENT ROOM, where I deposited him, and I am going to deposit him here in the NEIGHBOURHOOD, <i>Star.</i></p>
<p>He was Weydemeyer's last <i>compagnon</i> at his death and took his wife (Weydemeyer's wife), who was also <i>mourante,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>away from St Louis to friends and gave her support. Came to me with a recommendation from Jacobi<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>(New York).</p>
<p>This Meyer, who is travelling to Germany, <i>came to England solely to visit us both.</i> He arrived yesterday. I was not at home. My wife told him that I would be travelling to Manchester today to visit you.</p>
<p>These HINTS will be sufficient to explain to you how it comes about that he accompanied me on the journey here. He will only be staying here 2 days. AT FIRST I was vexed. But for Weydemeyer's sake! This Meyer is a fine, active fellow. However, COOKS slowly and somewhat boring.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Moor

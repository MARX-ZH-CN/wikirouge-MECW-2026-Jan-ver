MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>London, 12 December [1860]</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>BEST THANKS FOR ARTICLE.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> The item in the <i>Neue Preussische Zeitung</i> (if one disregards their own comments) is no more than a paragraph that appeared in the <i>Londoner Lithographierte Korrespondenz</i> (Schlesinger); with few exceptions, it was in <i>all</i> the German papers, for the most part under the heading 'London'.</p>
<p>The shorter version of the advertisement was confined to papers published in <i>England.</i> In the <i>German</i> papers, the table of contents was included.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>I am sending you herewith the advertisement in the <i>Buch- händlerbörsenblatt,'<b> composed by Petsch himself. The well-known 'politician' he speaks of at the end is </b></i><b>magnus'</b><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <i> L. Bücher, who indicated as much when talking to Borkheim.</i></p>
<p>The advertisements in the German papers probably appeared in the course of this week. A little after the book's arrival, it being undesirable (in view of the <i>Lawsuit')</i> to alert the Prussians.</p>
<p>Advertisements have been sent to the: <i>Allgemeine Zeitung; Br e si au er Zeitung; Bund</i> (Berne); <i>Deutsche Allgemeine'^</i>; <i>Frankfurter Journal; Hamburger Nachrichten; Freischütz; Reform; Karlsruher Zeitung; Kölnische Zeitung; Königsberger Härtung"; Mannheimer Journal; National-Zeitung; Neue Preussische Zeitung; Publicist;</i> Berlin <i>Volks-Zeitung; Ost-Deutsche Post; Presse; Rostocker Zeitung; Schwäbischer Merkur; Trier'sche Zeitung; Zeitung für Norddeutschland; Zürcher Neue Zeitung'<b><sup>1</sup></b></i><b>; <i>Neue Süddeutsche^</i> (Munich); <i>Morgenblatt; Wochenblatt des Nationalvereins"; Deutsches Museum; Illustrirte Zeitung; Ausland</i> (Augsburg); <i>Historische Deutsche Monatsschrift</i> (Brunswick).</b></p>
<p><i>New-Yorker Staatszeitung; New-Yorker Criminal-Zeitung; New-Yorker Abendzeitung. Times; Athenaeum; Critic; Saturday Review; Illustrated News; Manchester Guardian; Hermann.</i></p>
<p>Copies sent <i>inter alia</i> to Cotta, the <i>Reform,</i> Duncker, 6 to Siebel; various to the English papers (Sat. <i>Review, Athenaeum, Critic, III. News);</i> Lommel, Brass, Fischel. Over 50 free copies despatched in all, but only a few of them to newspapers.</p>
<p>41 sold in London to date.</p>
<p><i>Nota bene:</i> Lommel's <i>Hinter den Coulissen</i> is now in great demand in Germany. There have even been orders from Riga.</p>
<p><i>Bücher</i> (who contributes articles to the supplement of the Augsburg <i>Allgemeine Zeitung,</i> e. g., the one on Persigny and Palmerston) has promised Borkheim he will write a review for the <i>A. Z.</i> I fear Biscamp may forestall him.</p>
<p>Liebknecht has placed advertisements and lengthy excerpts in 4 German-American and 4 English-American papers. He is now, I might add, literary correspondent to the last-named.</p>
<p>'Mr Vogt' writes signed articles for some of the more obscure American-German papers. Rails at 'Bonaparte'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> Declared that my pamphlet would <i>never</i> come out.</p>
<p>My wife is much better. But the children probably won't be allowed home for another fortnight. I myself have to spend almost all day with her and am feeling far from well. However, that will resolve itself as soon as she is in a more normal state of health.</p>
<p>A week ago, Allen cancelled the prescription for claret and prescribed port instead. I should be grateful, therefore, if you would send me a few bottles of the latter.</p>
<p>My library has arrived.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> Still at the CUSTOM HOUSE, for the 'COMMISSIONERS' have not yet decided whether I am to have it DUTY FREE.</p>
<p>Now, just guess how I got to the bottom of <i>Ludwig Simon's</i> secret. (See appendix 16c.)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> Regards to Lupus.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

<li id="cite_note-5"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-5">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">This refers to Marx's private library which he had collected in the 1840s and left in the safekeeping of his friend, Communist League member Roland Daniels, in Cologne in May 1849, when expelled by the Prussian authorities. Shortly before being arrested in 1851, Daniels hid the books in the warehouse of his brother, a wine merchant. Acquitted at the Cologne Communist trial in late 1852, he came out of prison a gravely sick man. He died of tuberculosis in August 1855. At the beginning of 1856 Daniels' widow took steps to send the books to Marx, but owing to the high transportation costs and other problems, it was not until December 1860 that he received his library, with some books missing. A list of the books of this library, compiled by Daniels and with notes by Marx, has been preserved.</span>

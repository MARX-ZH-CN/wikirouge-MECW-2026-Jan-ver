To Engels in Manchester

28 Dean Street, Soho
<br>Dear Engels,
<br>Article splendid!<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> As regards Tuesday or Friday,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> arrange it as you wish, although I don't yet know whether I shall have a SECRETARY READY, since my wife has been confined to bed for the past three days, partly because of indisposition, partly in a fit of anger, for the worthy Dr Freund has again been bombarding us with dunning letters, which are the more odious for coming just before the impending catastrophe. GENERALLY, THE SITUATION IS NOT PLEASANT.
<br>Père Göhringer is in the debtors' prison. His pub is closed. Bankruptcy. Hence the renewed revolutionary ardour which the noble fellow is said to have developed of late.
<br>Pieper has to work in his institution<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> from 6 in the morning until 9 at night and to pray some 20X during that time, which 'does him good'. No smoking or drinking. Takes the boys to church, etc. He was in town for an hour a few days ago. Looked very well.
<br>Lupus has invited Dronke to Manchester for Christmas, and Dronke has invited Imandt.
<br>No other news.
<br>Your
<br>K. M.

<p><i>To Engels in St Hélier in Jersey</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 31 October 1857</b></p>
<p><b>Dear</b> Frederic,</p>
<p>Have received two letters from Dana. Says first, that '<i>Army'</i> arrived in good time. <i>Secondly</i>, that, because of the <b>commercial crisis</b>, notice has been given to all European correspondents except for myself and Bayard Taylor; 1, however, am to confine myself <b>strictly to 1 article per week —</b> lately I had been trying to break through this limitation — and for the time being write exclusively about the <b>Indian war</b> and the <b>financial crisis</b>.</p>
<p>If you could let me have the <b>History of Cannon</b> by Friday, <b>it would be a great boon</b>. As soon as the next mail arrives from India, you must write to me at some length about the Delhi affair or rather, <b>if possible</b>, do the whole article since this time it has to be purely technical.</p>
<p>I sent the chaps <b>about 8</b> sheets under the heading 'Blücher', the same being sub-titled '<b>The Silesian army in the campaigns etc.'</b> As I had to spend so much time reading Clausewitz, Müffling, etc., some degree of compensation was called for.</p>
<p>So far as your resolution as to Manchester is concerned, it seems to me <b>quite rational</b>, within Heckscher's <b>limitations</b>. Allen, too, says that fatal consequences are likely to result only if the lung is affected but that, in the early days after such a business, it behoves anyone to take care of himself.</p>
<p>The doses of iron may have been somewhat too strong. At all events it should have an excellent effect on your <b>body</b>. The weather here has improved during the past few days.</p>
<p><b>I should much like, old boy, to see you before your return to Manchester</b>. There is a certain irony of fate in my being personally embroiled in these damned crises. What <b>satisfaction</b> it would give Heinzen <i>s'il le savait</i> [if he knew]!</p>
<p>The news <b>as to</b> Schramm is no less saddening for being predictable. What do you say to Cavaignac's <b>death</b> and the idiocy of our liege-lord?</p>
<p>With warm regards from the <b>whole family</b>.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.
</p>

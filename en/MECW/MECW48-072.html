ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>[Extract]</p>
<p>London, 22 November 1887</p>
<p>You will have read in the L... the speech made by V. in the... constituency of K. He complains, not without reason, that the Party is getting bourgeois.</p>
<p>It is a misfortune that overtakes all extreme parties as soon as the day for them to become 'possible' draws near. But ours cannot go beyond a certain limit in this respect without betraying its own cause, <i>and it seems to me that in France as in Germany we have now reached that point. Luckily there is still time to call a halt.</i>

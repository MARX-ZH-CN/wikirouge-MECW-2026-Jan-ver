ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE
<br>IN PARIS
<br>[Extract]
<br>London, 22 November 1887
<br>You will have read in the L... the speech made by V. in the... constituency of K. He complains, not without reason, that the Party is getting bourgeois.
<br>It is a misfortune that overtakes all extreme parties as soon as the day for them to become 'possible' draws near. But ours cannot go beyond a certain limit in this respect without betraying its own cause, <i>and it seems to me that in France as in Germany we have now reached that point. Luckily there is still time to call a halt.</i>

ENGELS TO SIR HENRY ENFIELD ROSCOE
<br>IN LONDON
<br>[Draft]
<br>[London,] 28 May [1892]
<br>Dear Sir Henry,
<br>Many thanks for your note of yesterday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Gumpert has in fact given me a full report of the consultation with Dreschfeld, whom already 3 or 4 weeks ago he had proposed to Schorlemmer to call in, but Schorlemmer would not hear of it. As both medical men agree perfectly in their diagnosis, I am afraid there is but little hope left to us.
<br>I have my friend Bebel of the German Reichstag here staying with me until middle of next week,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and intend driving over to Manchester about Thursday 4 8 5 unless called before by Gumpert.
<br>If I do not reciprocate the style of address employed in your note,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> it is simply because that note is in the handwriting of a third party, and therefore an unintentional mistake not quite excluded.
<br>Yours truly

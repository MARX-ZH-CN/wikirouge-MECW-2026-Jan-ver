ENGELS TO SIR HENRY ENFIELD ROSCOE</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London,] 28 May [1892]</p>
<p>Dear Sir Henry,</p>
<p>Many thanks for your note of yesterday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>Gumpert has in fact given me a full report of the consultation with Dreschfeld, whom already 3 or 4 weeks ago he had proposed to Schorlemmer to call in, but Schorlemmer would not hear of it. As both medical men agree perfectly in their diagnosis, I am afraid there is but little hope left to us.</p>
<p>I have my friend Bebel of the German Reichstag here staying with me until middle of next week,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>and intend driving over to Manchester about Thursday 4 8 5 unless called before by Gumpert.</p>
<p>If I do not reciprocate the style of address employed in your note,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>it is simply because that note is in the handwriting of a third party, and therefore an unintentional mistake not quite excluded.</p>
<p>Yours truly
</p>

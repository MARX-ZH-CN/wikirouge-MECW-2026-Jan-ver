ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>[Manchester, about 24 April 1854]
<br>Dear Marx,
<br>It's absolutely impossible to do the things for <i>The</i> <i>Times</i> until I have more material, i. e. in a week or fortnight. I shall then finish them off straight away.
<br>As regards Schimmelpfennig,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I shall write something with Heise. The thing must be done in such a way that the fellow can't reply, hence very accurately or not at all.
<br>Something must be done about Heise; matters cannot continue very much longer as they are. So I am writing to Cluss today,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> asking him to tell me whether he can put Heise in touch with an Anglo-American paper—the fellow writes passable English—and 2. whether the <i>Reform</i> could pay him. Both of these on condition that Eccarius will not suffer as a result, for he, after all, has first claim. I have informed Cluss that if there is any objection of this kind you will advise him by next Tuesday's STEAMER. At the same time I notified Cluss of the Schimmelpfennig article, so that they don't do anything stupid in New York.
<br>I can't write another word today.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.
<br>Kossuth—magnificent!

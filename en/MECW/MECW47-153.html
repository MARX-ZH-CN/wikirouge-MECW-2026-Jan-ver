ENGELS TO NIKOLAI DANIELSON
<br>IN ST PETERSBURG
<br>London, 11 February 1885
<br>My dear Sir,
<br>I shall be glad to send you the proof-sheets of Volume II as soon as you let me know whether I shall send them <b>sous bande</b> (per book-post) or in a closed envelope as a letter. The fact is, that if one gets lost, it will be impossible to replace it until the work is completed. By the time your answer arrives I expect to have two or three for you.
<br>I thank you very much for the offer you made me some time ago to place at my disposal the letters you have from Mr Williams.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> At present the manuscripts claim all my time and attention, but the moment is sure to come when I shall take advantage of your kind offer.
<br>Have you any news from our mutual friend since the accident which happened to him some time ago?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>Be kind enough to address in future as stated at foot.
<br>Yours very sincerely,
<br>P. Rosher
<br>Mrs Rosher

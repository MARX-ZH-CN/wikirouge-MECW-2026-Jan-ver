ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN</p>
<p>IN ZURICH</p>
<p>London, 14 April 1883</p>
<p>Dear Mr Bernstein,</p>
<p>Dr Aveling, editor of <i>Progress,</i> wrote to <i>The Republican</i> with a view to purchasing the wood block of Marx's portrait which appeared in that paper. 13 Came the reply: <i>THATBLOCK.</i> HAS BEEN SENT TO GERMANY FOR THE <i>Sozialdemokrat,</i> so IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO HAVE IT. Aveling now en- joins me to write forthwith, asking if he could have the block as soon as possible. If not, then perhaps a cliché of it. There may also be some misunderstanding, the block having, perhaps, gone to the <i>Neue Welt.</i> Please let me know at once by postcard. 14</p>
<p>The report of the Congress ' 5 most edifying. ' 6</p>
<p>In great haste,</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F.E.</p>

<p>The 2nd volume of <i>Capital</i> is there — but I can't tell you what a state it's in— 1,000 pages of ms. to go through. 17 However, don't put anything in the paper yet; as soon as I can say anything for sure, I'll let you have something authoritative.

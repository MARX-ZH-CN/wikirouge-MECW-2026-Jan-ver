ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN
<br>IN ZURICH
<br>London, 14 April 1883
<br>Dear Mr Bernstein,
<br>Dr Aveling, editor of <i>Progress,</i> wrote to <i>The Republican</i> with a view to purchasing the wood block of Marx's portrait which appeared in that paper. 13 Came the reply: <i>THATBLOCK.</i> HAS BEEN SENT TO GERMANY FOR THE <i>Sozialdemokrat,</i> so IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO HAVE IT. Aveling now en- joins me to write forthwith, asking if he could have the block as soon as possible. If not, then perhaps a cliché of it. There may also be some misunderstanding, the block having, perhaps, gone to the <i>Neue Welt.</i> Please let me know at once by postcard. 14
<br>The report of the Congress ' 5 most edifying. ' 6
<br>In great haste,
<br>Yours,
<br>F.E.
<br><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>The 2nd volume of <i>Capital</i> is there — but I can't tell you what a state it's in— 1,000 pages of ms. to go through. 17 However, don't put anything in the paper yet; as soon as I can say anything for sure, I'll let you have something authoritative.

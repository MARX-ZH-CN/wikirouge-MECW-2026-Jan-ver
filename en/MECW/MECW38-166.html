TO ENGELS IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 15 April 1851</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>You have not had a letter and are getting no more than these few lines now, because FROM DAY TO DAY I have been awaiting your letter—the one you promised. Enclosed a letter from Lupus. I wrote to him 4 days ago, but didn't answer the questions addressed to you.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>A letter from a Fischer in America whom I don't know. In the meantime I have asked Liebknecht to write to him.</p>
<p>I shall send you a letter from Rothacker in my next. That jackass, too, is an editor in America. From his letter it transpires that, from the extreme FAR WEST to the east we are being loudly inveighed against, both in speech and in print. In his rag Weitling published an article said to be from Paris but in fact by Willich, attacking me and you.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Schnauffer, on the other hand, has attacked the great Willich.</p>
<p>As for Struve, no sooner had he made himself answerable for the 10 millions, than he distributed a leaflet in the City begging for money to help him emigrate to America, together with Amalia.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> In this he was successful. Last Friday he pushed off, still with Amalia.</p>
<p>Willich, with Göhringer for mentor, is said to have become very devoted to the TRICKER. Incidentally, for a fortnight after receiving the latest reply from pseudo-Becker, enclosing the toast, he suffered from a bilious fever. For 2 weeks never left the chapel, i.e. the barracks. And on his return to the Windmill,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> he brought up for discussion the question of the toast and the introductory comment,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> presumably so as to equip himself with a <i>testimonium paupertatis</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Schapper has framed a constitution for England since, after mature consideration and lengthy discussion in that same Windmill, they decided that England had no written constitution and must therefore be given one. And Schapper-Gebert will provide her with this constitution. It's already written.</p>
<p>Schimmelpfennig has been travelling round Germany and has everywhere been busily engaged in intrigues against us, in the common interest of Willich-Schapper, Ruge-Kinkel, Becker<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> -Sigel. Especially at the seats of Kinkel-mania, and more particularly in Westphalia, Osnabrück, Bielefeld, etc., where they've never been well-disposed towards us, there is no end to the tittle-tattle.</p>
<p>Your
K. M.

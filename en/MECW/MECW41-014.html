MARX TO JOACHIM LELEWEL
<br>IN BRUSSELS
<br><i>[Draft]</i>
<br>London, 3 February 1860<br>9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, Haverstock Hill
<br>My dear Lelewel,
<br>I have not had the pleasure of corresponding with you since 1848 when a letter of recommendation from you was brought to me in Cologne by a Pole.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I am writing to you today on a personal matter.
<br>One Vogt, a professor at Geneva, has published a pamphlet<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> full of the most outrageous calumnies against my person and my political life. On the one hand, he represents me as a man of no account and on the other imputes to me the most infamous motives. He falsifies my entire past. Having had the privilege of enjoying a close relationship with you during my stay in Brussels—I shall never forget the embrace with which you honoured me on the occasion of the anniversary of the Polish Revolution on 22 February 1848—I would request you to address me a private letter in which you assure me of your friendship and testify to the nature of the honourable relations I maintained in Brussels with the Polish emigration.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <br>Fraternal greetings,
<br>Yours
<br>Charles Marx
<br>Mrs Marx, who asks to be remembered to you, has made a copy of this letter for your benefit, my handwriting being illegible.

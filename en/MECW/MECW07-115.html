<br><em>Cologne,</em> September 11. We are addressing the following request for information to whichever gentlemen in the Public Prosecutor's department it may concern:
<br>Is it true that at 8 o'clock yesterday evening Herr Salget and Herr Blum Jr., from Cologne, who had already formed a workers' association in Cassel, were arrested in Wesseling, by the Burgomaster Herr von Geier, on the instigation of the parson? They had intended to form a workers' association in Wesseling too, but were arrested before they had even spoken a word in public and before the meeting had begun.
<br>Is it true that the only reason for this arrest, which did in fact take place, was the pastor's denunciation that the two gentlemen wanted to stir up the workers?
<br>Assuming that this is how matters stand, will the Public Prosecutor take steps to deal with this outrageous infringement of the law or — in expectation of the Radowitz Ministry and of the speedy abolition of the right of free association — will he give Herr von Geier a vote of thanks?

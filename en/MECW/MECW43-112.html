London, 18 November<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> 1868</p>
<p>Dear Fred,</p>
<p>The <b>landlord</b> (unfortunately he is living <i>pro tempore</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> in London), wrote me the enclosed letter some time ago. Yesterday he called, but was not, of course, admitted, since I was allegedly absent. The devil of it is that, because of the OVEREND AFFAIR,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> this fellow lives on his house rents; in addition, he will not accept bills of exchange. At other times the PRESSURE for the house has never been so IMMEDIATE, since I only owe him for 1 QUARTER. Lessner, too, is kicking me for THE REMAINDER OF MY DEBT, his wife is DESPERATELY SICK.</p>
<p>GENERALLY the SITUATION is bad.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, on the CENTRAL COUNCIL<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> the ENGLISH TOO LATE but UNANIMOUSLY acknowledged that I h a d forecast literally for them, the, for me, HIGHLY AMUSING UPSHOT of the elections, with a criticism of the incorrect policy of the REFORM-LEAGUE.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> The present HOUSE is the worst since the election under Pam's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> command. The LONG PURSES have never had such an exclusive preponderance. E. Jones had boasted in too Lassallean a manner. At the last Sunday meeting of his congregation in CLEVELAND HALL, there was displayed a placard TO THIS EFFECT: FAREWELL TO THE GREAT ICONOCLAST, THE PEOPLES REDEEMER. LONG LlVE TO MR BRADLAUGH, THE DREAD NAUGHT OF ST STEPHEN'S!<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>In France things look very serious, according to Lafargue's last letters too. The government wants to force the lads on to the streets so that <i>chassepot</i>!<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> and RIFLED CANNON may then laisser 'faire merveille'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> Can you see any CHANCE of successful street conflicts? Defection of the army without a previous thrashing appears to me scarcely credible.</p>
<p>Biichner's clumsy work<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> is of interest to me in as much as it quotes most of the German research in the field of Darwinism — Prof. Jäger (Vienna) and Prof. Haeckel. According to them, the cell has been abandoned as the primaeval form; instead a formless but contractile particle of albumen is taken as STARTING POINT. This hypothesis was later confirmed by the discoveries in Canada (later also in Bavaria and SOME OTHER PLACES). The primaeval form must naturally be traced down to the point at which it may be produced chemically. And it appears that the way to this point has been found.</p>
<p>The conscientiousness with which Büchner has acquainted himself with the English stuff is also shown by the fact that he classifies Owen as one of Darwin's supporters.</p>
<p>Borkheim's letter to you,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> which you sent me, I had the pleasure to have read to me for A SECOND TIME by him in person. This nincompoop now accuses Eichhoff of being a 'BUSYBODY'(!) and of 'writing long letters'. What self-knowledge!</p>
<p>Apropos the Irish elections, the only interesting POINT is Dungarvan, where Burry is presenting himself under the protection of the defector O'Donovan. (Ditto under the protection of the priest.) There is a GENERAL CRY against him amongst the Irish Nationalists since this blackguard, as government prosecutor during the first trial of the Fenians in Dublin, hurled such slanders (à la Constitutionnel against the June insurgents)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> that even the London papers gave him a wigging.</p>
<p>Salut.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p><br>
I believe Nincompoop<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> has gone to Bordeaux! Such a business trip is certainly necessary to cool his brain fever.

The League's leading bodies—the Council and Executive Committee— included the General Council members, mainly trade-union leaders. The League's programme was drafted under the influence of Marx, who called upon the working-classes to pursue their policy independently of bourgeois parties. Unlike these parties, which confined their demands to household suffrage, the League advanced the demand for manhood suffrage. This revived Chartist slogan (see Note 201) evoked a sympathetic response among the working class and won the League the support of the trade unions, hitherto indifferent to politics. The League had branches in all major industrial towns and counties. However, the vacillations of the bourgeois radicals in its leadership, and the conciliation of the trade union leaders prevented the League from following the line chartered by the General Council. The British bourgeoisie succeeded in splitting the movement, and a moderate reform was carried out in 1867 which granted franchise only to the petty bourgeoisie and the upper layer of the working class.</span>

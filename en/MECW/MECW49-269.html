ENGELS TO REGINA AND EDUARD BERNSTEIN
<br>IN ZURICH
<br>London, 17 September 1892
<br>Dear Gine,
<br>From Louise, who came back here on Wednesday,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I have learned that you are still in Zurich and that Käte<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> is already in this country, and yesterday the letter from you and Ede at last enabled me to connect up the broken telegraph wires again. We are most sorry that you should still be so unwell but that is something that will eventually pass, and in the meantime Ede can continue to recuperate in the open air for a while longer, which will be most beneficial for him and do the party no harm, now that he has in any case missed the TRADES UNION Congress.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> The latter was the scene of considerable confusion. The most interesting session from our point of view was the one on Thursday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> on the question of the Congress.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> If we had known your address, we'd have sent Ede a Scottish paper containing an account of it, but as it is, the few copies we had have been sent elsewhere.
<br>When, despite continuous prodding from Thorne, the letter of invitation from Zurich 'to the TRADE UNION CONGRESS' in Glasgow had obstinately been withheld for 4 whole days, Matkin tabled a motion, clearly concocted in conjunction with the 'old' unionists with a view to preventing attendance at Zurich, in which he called for the convocation of an international 8 hours congress of their own. Parnell, on the other hand, proposed an AMENDMENT to the effect that it would be better to go to Zurich. According to Ed. Aveling, Parnell and Quelch spoke very well. At that, all the old unionists went mad. The continental workers, they said, were weak and badly organised, but if the English took them under their wing all might go well; in any case the Zurich Congress had not been convoked by the English TRADES UNIONS. Besides, who would want to associate himself with all the WILD THEORIES and the kind of SOCIALISM that throve on the Continent, etc.? (This latter anxiety, in particular, being voiced in rasping tones by a Lancashire weaver,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> one of the new converts to the 8 hour day.)
<br>In short, in their delight that there should now be almost no opposition to the 8 HOURS DAY, and by way of a sop to the weak in spirit — the Lancashire cotton operatives — they unceremoniously consigned the Continentals' invitation to the waste paper basket, and by 189 votes to 97, no less!
<br>Now this, although most of them were probably unaware of what they were doing, was in fact a disgusting insult and a slap in the face for the entire continental Labour movement. We instantly broadcast the news here, there and everywhere and no doubt the first riposte will come from the French in a few days' time at Marseilles.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> It's a heaven-sent opportunity — without making too much of the matter— for putting a damper on the self-conceit of the <i>old</i> TRADES unionists who are proving ever more reactionary.
<br>Herewith a <i>Pall-Mall</i> containing an article of Aveling's about the Hamburg socialists and the cholera.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> <br>In the <i>Daily Chronicle</i> there was a long review, which no doubt you will have seen, of SOCIALISM UTOPIAN, etc.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> What a canny lot they are!
<br>The French daily has not yet emerged from the embryonic stage; negotiations are still proceeding but this is better than if the chaps were again to rush headlong into some short-lived venture.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> <br>Louise came back in a very cheerful mood, having found her mother and Ignaz very hale and hearty. She sends her warm regards.
<br>Now for a note to Ede, so farewell for today. With warm regards,
<br>Yours,
<br>F. Engels
<br>Dear Ede,
<br>The relevant passage went off to K. Kautsky<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> yesterday — indeed the <i>entire</i> letter from the point at which you began to quote; I told K. Kautsky that <i>he</i> would know how much to use, whether the whole thing or only a part, and which part.
<br>At the last conference of the SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION (BANK HOLIDAY,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> the first Monday in August), Taylor, the unsuccessful candidate for Hackney,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> proposed that Hyndman be thrown out. This met with great acclaim, particularly among the provincial delegates; however, Taylor was persuaded to tone down his motion in order that as large a majority as possible might be obtained. And thus it was resolved (unanimously, according to Taylor) that Hyndman be requested to resign from the leadership of the SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC FEDERATION and devote himself to written propaganda. How long this will continue remains to be seen. At all events it is a bitter blow for the megalomaniac. Cahan of New York, who called on him without knowing about this, found him in a very despondent, chastened frame of mind and remarkably conciliatory towards all those he had hitherto torn to shreds.
<br>The <i>Workman's Times,</i> i. e. Burgess, now also wishes to become party leader. You will have seen that the £400, which he placed at the disposal of Burns, Keir Hardie, Taylor and Ben Ellis during the elections, emanated from Champion (or rather, through him, from Hudson's Soap).
<br>In short, there have been a good many changes here during your absence and you will find the chaps engaged in a variety of interesting pursuits.
<br>Many regards,
<br>Your
<br>F.E.
<br>I haven't yet seen Käte.

At the same time it turned down an invitation to the third International Socialist Workers' Congress in Zurich (1893) received from its preparatory committee, and decided to call another international congress — on the eight-hour day issue. This could interfere with the congress of the Second International being prepared by the Marxists and split the international working-class movement. Engels emphatically opposed these actions of the British union leaders. He sent letters to Germany, Austria, Spain and France recommending the socialist parties to publicly condemn them (see present edition, Vol. 27, and this volume, pp. 522-24, 528-29, 530-31, 533-35).</span>

The congress adopted an agrarian programme which contained a number of specific demands reflecting the interests of the farm labourers and small peasants. The congress decided against the party's participation in the international congress called by the British trades unions to discuss the eight-hour working day (see Note 540) and for inviting British trade unionists to the Zurich Congress.</span>

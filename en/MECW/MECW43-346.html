ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>Manchester, 7 July 1870
<br>Dear Moor,
<br>I had to write to you yesterday about Dupont<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> in all haste, and without being able to consider the case properly with Lizzie; I had been busy in town the whole day, and in the evening there was a BALLOT at the club, so I could only discuss the business properly with Lizzie later; and it thus turned out that there is no reason to burden either Serraillier or Dupont's brother-in-law with the girl, for it will be hard enough for them to look after the other children; the child can sleep perfectly well with Mary Ellen<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and will not inconvenience us in any way. Dupont can also stay with me for the first few days, until we have got him fixed up to some extent, and it will be much better if I do this together with him, rather than alone, without having him along. Lizzie says she has bedding enough, without that used by Mary Ellen during her scarlet fever, which I naturally would not like to have used yet.
<br>When I wrote to you yesterday morning I had no way of knowing this yet, but so that you might receive today other news in addition to yesterday's letter, I telegraphed you this morning:
<br>D u p o n t ' s LITTLE GIRL WELCOME TO STAY WITH US, DIRECT THEM BOTH TO MY
<br>HOME, ADVISE TIME OF ARRIVAL.
<br>I hope you received this telegram <i>before</i> further consultations with Dupont. You must persuade him that he should not hesitate to accept my offer (if it is necessary, i.e., the persuasion), he is making things easier not only for himself but for <i>me</i> too, by coming to me right away with the little one. So request him in my name to do as I suggest, and just let me know when he will be arriving so I can meet him at the station.
<br>Best greetings.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

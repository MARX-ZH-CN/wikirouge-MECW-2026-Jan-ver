<br>In the camp's finest tent we'd sat all night<br>And mingled Spanish wine with German song.<br>The fields were turning grey in dawn's first light;<br>Our eyes were aching — we'd stayed up so long.<br>The sun's rays peeped into our tent and found<br>Our sherry bottles drained, in disarray.<br>The hour was late. Time we were homeward bound.<br>Come, let us mount the horses and away!
<br>We flew. After carousing all night long,<br>What bliss to feel the freshness of the morrow.<br>Still in our ears the sound of strings and song;<br>Still far away the long day's care and worry.<br>The shades of night had vanished. From the sky<br>Light fell on river, trees, fields bathed in dew.<br>We all looked up to trace with joyful eye<br>The sun's bright progress through the cloudless blue.
<br>We're home. Our steeds coursed well. Now I stand here<br>Upon the threshold of work's tribulations.<br>Here is the paper. Let me draw fresh cheer<br>By drinking from the well-spring of the nations.<br>Russia, Great Britain, Turkish catastrophes!<br>And now for Germany — does all go well?<br>Ah, here.... What? Dead? Can I believe my eyes?<br>You, Immermann, must also bid farewell?<br>Defiant heart, so full of noble scorn,<br>Must you depart, then, for eternity,<br>Now that we see the rose despite the thorn<br>And bow to you in all humility?<br>Now that, like Schiller, proudly you beheld<br>Your people hang on every word from you?<br>Now that the love within your bosom held<br>Had blossomed forth with shining rays anew?
<br>Aloof in German poetry's sacred grove,<br>You shunned your fellow bards' vociferous throng,<br>And by the Rhine in solitude you wove<br>The images of many a gentle song.<br>The mob's harsh clamour never came to hurt you<br>In the flower garden where you toiled away.<br>So few the stories they could spread about you;<br>Living, you were a legend in your day.
<br>Because the maltitude, that never can<br>Conceive what power inspires the poet's lays,<br>Why should they heed the silent, serious man<br>Who wanders far from their well-trodden ways?<br>But you, 0 Immermann, that now have died,<br>Wanted to wrestle with yourself, alone,<br>And all the bitter jarring strife inside<br>That you grew up with, master on your own.
<br>So, meditating through the long dark night<br>That held in thrall our German poetry,<br>In solitude you fought the inner fight<br>And battled through to see the dawning day.<br>When far above your dwelling's mossy stones<br>July's wild thunder rolled away at last,<br>You sent into the world your <em>Epigones</em>,<br>That requiem for a generation past.
<br>And yet you saw the rising generation,<br>Those in whose hearts the youthful fires blaze,<br>Speak loudly to defend your reputation,<br>Your right to wear the bard's full crown of bays.<br>In your abode you saw us drawing nigh,<br>You saw us silent at your feet, as we<br>Looked up into your rapt and thoughtful eye<br>And listened to your rolling poetry.
<br>Now that the people, who forgot your name,<br>Have welcomed you with shouts of joy, bestowing<br>On you your rightful laurels of acclaim,<br>0 Immermann, is this a time for going?<br>Farewell! Here in this land of Germany<br>Poets to match your skill are very few.<br>I settled down to work, and swore to be<br>As German, and as strong and firm as you.
<br><br>
Friedrich Oswald

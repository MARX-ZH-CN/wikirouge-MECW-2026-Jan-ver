ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL</p>
<p>IN BERLIN</p>
<p>London, 7 May 1892</p>
<p>Dear August,</p>
<p>So we can expect to see you here on Saturday,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>a week today.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Let's hope you instil so much confidence into Paulus<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>while afloat that he will regard the crossing via Ostend as a trial trip for the crossing to Chicago.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>For if he plucks up enough courage, he could go straight on to Chicago by water <i>all the way</i>—from Liverpool to Montreal on the St Lawrence and thence through the Great Lakes, after which he would for ever be immune; for on the big, inland lakes even the most seasoned old salts are sea-sick and, when the four of us survived a storm on Lake Erie without being affected in that way,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>we were regarded as prodigies by the entire company.</p>
<p>But if you imagine I now intend to reply to your three letters in detail and in writing, you are mistaken. Louise has just come back from town bringing with her a tremendous thirst, so that we have ventured on a second mid-morning glass of beer and are in exceedingly merry mood. For it is very warm outdoors and hence we must, to use a Prussian expression, bring about a change.</p>
<p>You will be meeting Mendelson and his wife<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>who were here last Sunday and will also be able to go and converse with them at their house.</p>
<p>The fact that we had good weather for May Day and you did not, serves you right. You should have been over here and then you'd have been able to see what it looks like when 600,000 people foregather in one place<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>; it was really tremendous; and an impression like that leaves one in no state to sustain even such criticism as is called for by the deplorable scheming and squabbling before the event, and yet sustain it one must.</p>
<p>When you come over here, your doctor's orders will safeguard you against any sort of public speechifying, always assuming that you yourself abide by the said orders. You know how it is — anyone who lets himself be talked round on just <i>one</i> occasion, is lost for good and all.</p>
<p>Laura Lafargue writes to say that, while our chaps have so far been victorious in the French municipal elections<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>at a number of places, the real results, because of the second ballot, won't be known until next week. So far I haven't seen much about it in the press.</p>
<p>Well, mind you bring with you a pair of good horny hands; we have already written to the BOARD OF WORKS, instructing them to put at our disposal sufficient ancient trees in the parks of London to enable you to uproot at least one a day for your breakfast.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Cordial regards from Louise.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F.E.

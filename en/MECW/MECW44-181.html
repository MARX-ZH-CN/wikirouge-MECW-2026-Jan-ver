MARX TO MALTMAN BARRY</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London,] 7 January 1872</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I regret that you found neither me nor Mr Engels at home. You seem to proceed in your letters from the idea that we form a distinct party in the Council. If we opposed Mr Hales in what we considered wrong, we did only our duty<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and would, under the same circumstances, have followed the same line of conduct towards any other member of the Council.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> This, however, has nothing to do with party. We know of no parties in the Council. There are among the friends of Mr Hales very worthy men who have worked for a long time in our cause.</p>
<p>If Mr Mottershead has 'consented to stand for the secretary- ship', we at all events did not invite him to do so. His position as paid secretary of the 'Labour Representation League'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> makes the thing almost impossible. Mr Engels told you expressly after last Tuesday's meeting<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> that his mind was not yet made up as [to] who was the proper person to vote for, and for the present we see difficulties on all sides. Hence we have resolved to leave our continental friends to their own discretion.</p>
<p>In our opinion the important thing is, to settle the position and composition of the Federal Council. As to the secretaryship, it is mainly a personal matter which need not and, perhaps, cannot be settled in a hurry. At all events this will depend upon cir- cumstances.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>K. M.

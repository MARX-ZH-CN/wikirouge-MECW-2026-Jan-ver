ENGELS TO RICHARD FISCHER</p>
<p>IN BERLIN</p>
<p>[London,] 29 May 1895</p>
<p>Dear Fischer,</p>
<p>Thanks for the package. Am not yet in a fit state to deal with it. In the meantime I would ask you to send me in addition a copy of all the articles on the Mosel wine-growers. 584 For Hofrichter of Cologne has been here</p>
<p>and would like to have them so as to make use of them at home. 605 He and I have therefore agreed that I should send for them and that, if unable to use all or any of them, I should let him have them, in which case he will repay you, at the <i>Rheinische Zeitung,</i> the cost of having them copied. So you are covered either way. Kindest regards.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F.E.

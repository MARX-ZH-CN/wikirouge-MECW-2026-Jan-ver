ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>London, 1 January 1885</p>
<p>My dear Laura,</p>
<p>In all haste a few lines. Moore and Jollymeyer are off to Tussy's and so I have profited of the occasion to shake off a lot of business let- ters— a few moments remain before 5.30.</p>
<p>I had paid for your <i>Justice</i> up to 31 December, but as I had no proper receipt, could not do much — besides every letter of mine to anybody at that office was followed by an application from them for an article of mine, so that I really could not write to them even on business. However Edward says he pays to the Modern Press and so I have sent the money today for both you and myself for 6 months' <i>Justice</i> and <i>To-Day</i> and hope you will get it. What we can get of back numbers you shall also have, but there is not much in it worth your notice, the leaning towards the Possibilists is of quite recent date and not at all pronounced, except last No. [with] a letter from Adolphe Smith. Now however it's sure to bloom out.</p>
<p>Last night we were at Pumps', she is uncommonly well but over- does it a little — the baby all right.</p>
<p>I am sorry the crisis in the Social Democratic Federation<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>could not be retarded a little longer; Hyndman would have got deeper into the mud, and the personal element would have been thrown more into the background. However it could not be helped. The reason why the majority, instead of following up their victory, <i>resigned,</i> and starts a new organisation<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>was this chiefly, as Morris said to me:</p>
<p>that the old organisation was not <i>worth having.</i> The London branches are about 300 strong in all and those they hope mostly to get, and as to the provinces, it's all bosh and bogus.</p>
<p>Well we'll see what they will make. There is this to be said in their favour: that three more unpractical men for a political organisation than Aveling, Bax and Morris are not to be found in all England. But they are sincere.</p>
<p>Again Happy New Year to both of you and to the poor little ones<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>at Argenteuil when you see them, from Nim and myself.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F.E.

The <i>Socialist League</i> was formed in December 1884 by a group of English socialists who had left the Social Democratic Federation. Its organisers included Eleanor Marx, Ernest Belfort Bax, William Morris and others. 'The Manifesto of the Socialist League' (see <i>The Commonweal,</i> No. 1, February 1885) proclaimed that its members advocate 'the principles of Revolutionary International Socialism' and '...seek a change in the basis of Society ... which would destroy the distinctions of classes and nationalities'. The League set itself the task of establishing a national workers' party adhering to international stand, assisting the trade union and co operative movements. In its initial years the League and its officials took an active part in the workers' movement. However, in 1887 the League's leadership split into three factions (anarchist elements, the 'parliamentarians' and the 'antiparliamentarians'); its links with the day-to-day struggles of the English workers were gradually weakened and there was a growth in sectarianism. In 1889-90 the League fell apart.</span>

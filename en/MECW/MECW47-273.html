ENGELS TO EDUARD BERNSTEIN</p>
<p>IN ZURICH</p>
<p>Eastbourne, 14 August 1886<br>
4 Cavendish Place</p>
<p>Dear Ede,</p>
<p>A fortnight ago I sent you a <i>Standard</i> containing a Bulgarian report<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> on Russian intrigues in the Balkans which was very important.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the situation has been getting more and more critical, for Alexander III is in need of a success after his many setbacks and, in view of the multifarious intrigues, it might well happen that matters get beyond the gentlemen's control and war breaks out. In this con- nection I wanted to pass on to you the story sent in by the <i>Daily News</i> correspondent in St Petersburg, which he insists is true despite all disclaimers, that between the 18th and the end of this month six Russian army corps, opposed by six ditto, will be engaged on ma- noeuvres in the neighbourhood of Vilna, i. e. close to the Prussian border; an assemblage, that is, of 12 army corps (the whole German army has only 18 of them) or, at a very modest estimate, 240,000 men. We may be sure that the vast sum of money involved isn't being chucked down die drain out of sheer bravado. Moreover Alexander III has forbidden <i>all</i> foreign officers to attend, even <i>Werder,</i> the Prussian. While these 240,000 men are concentrated on the border, Mr Giers will arrive in Germany to negotiate with Bismarck. It is a very bold stratagem, especially having regard to old William,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> for he is being tackled precisely on this, his most sensitive flank. So things may go wrong and war break out. It may equally well be settled on the quiet, for we may be sure that Giers will not willingly be a party to such out- rageous pranks. However I thought it as well to draw your attention to this curious business.</p>
<p>Tell Schlüter that I shall attend to his piece as soon as I get back to London. I may possibly see old Harney before that, in which case I shall be able to glean a good deal of information that will be of interest to him.</p>
<p>Kindest regards. Back in London on the 28th of this month.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F.E.

<p>Note from Marx-Engels Collected Works, Volume 6, 1976 :
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These Rules of the Communist League are based on the <a communist="" href="Draft_Rules_of_the_Communist_League.html" league"="" of="" raft="" rules="" the="">draft Rules elaborated by the League's First Congress</a>. Marx and Engels, who exerted considerable influence on the elaboration of the League's new organisational principles, greatly contributed to improving the text of the Rules and gave it greater precision. In particular, it was they, in all probability, who drew up the new formulation of Article 1 defining the aim of the League. The Rules in their present version were adopted by the Second Congress of the Communist League.
This document was first published in English in the book: Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>, Lawrence, London, 1930.

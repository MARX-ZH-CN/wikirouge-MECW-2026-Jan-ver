<br><b>Dear Fred</b>,
<br>Regarding Moses, I shall follow your prescription exactly. At all events, we must make use of the man and, at the same time, prevent him from misusing us. Regarding Hilberg, it would indeed be a good thing if we could keep a hold on this <em>Revue</em> being the only one still open to us, but how? is not yet clear to me. This morning I received a copy of Schorlemmer <b>and send him my thanks for it</b>.
<br>If you have read the papers, you will have seen that 1. the <b>International Council</b> sent <b>memorial</b> for the <b>Fenians</b> to Hardy, 2. the debate on <b>Fenianism</b> (a week ago last Tuesday) was public and <em>The Times</em> carried a <b>Report</b> on it. There were also <b>reporters</b> there from the Dublin <em>Irishman</em> and <em>Nation.</em> I did not arrive until very late (I have been suffering from a fever for about 2 weeks, and have only got over it in the last 2 days) and had not in fact intended to speak, first on account of my uncomfortable physical condition, and second because of the delicacy of the situation. However, the <b>Chairman</b> Weston wanted to force me to, so I moved <b>adjournment</b>, which obliged me to speak last Tuesday. What I had in fact prepared for <b>Tuesday last</b> was not a <b>speech</b> but rather the <b>points</b> for <b>a speech</b> ['Notes for an Undelivered Speech on Ireland']. However, the <b>Irish reporters</b> did not come, and by the time we had finished waiting for them it was 9 o'clock, whereas the premises were only available to us until 10 1/2. At my suggestion, Fox had prepared a long <b>speech</b> (because of a <b>quarrel</b> on the <b>Council</b> he had made no appearance for 2 weeks, and furthermore sent in his <b>resignation</b> as <b>member of the Council</b> containing furious outbursts against Jung). When the <em>séance</em> opened I therefore declared that, on account of the <b>belated hour</b>, I would yield the floor to Fox. In fact — because the executions in Manchester had intervened — our subject '<b>Fenianism'</b> was bound up with the passions and heated emotions of the moment, which would have compelled <em>me</em> (though not the abstract <em>Fox</em>) to unleash a revolutionary thunderbolt. instead of the intended objective analysis of the situation and the movement. The Irish <b>reporters</b> thus did me a great service by staying away and so delaying the opening of the meeting. I do not enjoy getting embroiled with people like Roberts, Stephens, and the like.
<br>Fox's <b>speech</b> was good, first because it was delivered by <em>an Englishman,</em> and second insofar as it dealt only with political and international <b>aspects</b>. However, for that very reason he only skated over the surface of things. The resolution he brought forward was silly and pointless. I opposed it and had it referred back to the <b>Standing Committee</b>.
<br>What the English do not yet realise, is that since 1846 the economic content and hence the political purpose of English rule in Ireland as well has entered an entirely new phase, and that for that very reason <b>Fenianism</b> is characterised by socialist (in the negative sense, as directed against the <b>appropriation</b> of the <b>soil</b>) leanings and as a <b>lower orders movement</b>. What could be more absurd than to lump together the barbarities of Elizabeth or Cromwell, who wanted to drive out the Irish by means of English colonists (in the Roman sense), and the present system, which wants to drive out the Irish by means of sheep, pigs and oxen! The system of 1801-1846 (<b>evictions</b> in that period were exceptional, particularly in Leinster, where the soil is especially suited to cattle-raising) with its <b>rackfrents</b> and <b>middlemen</b>, collapsed in 1846. The <b>Anti-Corn Law-Repeal</b>, in part a consequence of or, at all events, hastened by the <b>Irish famine</b>, took from Ireland its <em>monopoly</em> of supplying England with corn in normal times. Wool and meat became the watchword, hence <b>conversion of tillage into pasture</b>. So from then on, <b>systematic consolidation of farms</b>. The <b>Encumbered Estates Act</b> which made <b>landlords</b> of a mass of former <b>middlemen</b> who had grown rich, hastened the process. <b>Clearing of the estates of Ireland!</b> is now the sole meaning of English rule in Ireland. The <em>stupid</em> English government in London naturally knows even nothing of this <b>immense change</b> since 1846. But the Irish do. From <em>Meagher's Proclamation</em> (1848) down to <em>Hennessy's election address</em> (Tory and Urquhartite) (1866) the Irish have been expressing their awareness of it in the clearest and <b>most forcible manner</b>.
<br>The question now is, what advice should <em>we</em> give the <em>English</em> workers? In my view, they must make <b>repeal</b> <em>of the</em> <b>Union</b> (in short, the <em>farce of</em> 1783, only democratised and adapted to meet present circumstances) an article of their <em>pronunziamento.</em> This is the only <em>legal</em> and hence the only possible form of Irish emancipation which can be adopted by an <em>English</em> party in its programme. Experience must later show, whether mere personal union between the 2 countries can continue to exist. I half believe it could if it comes about in due time.
<br>What the Irish need is:

<blockquote>
<br>1. Self-government and independence from England.

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<br>2. Agrarian revolution. With the best will in the world the English cannot do this for them, but they can give them the legal means to do it for themselves.

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<br>3. <em>Protective tariffs against England.</em> From 1783-1801 every branch of industry in Ireland flourished. By suppressing the protective tariffs which the Irish parliament had established, the Union destroyed all industrial life in Ireland. The little bit of linen industry is in no way a substitute. The Union of 1801 affected Irish industry exactly as did the measures for the suppression of the Irish wool industry, etc., on the part of the English parliament under Anne, George II, and others. As soon as the Irish became independent, necessity would turn them, like Canada, Australia, etc., into protectionists. Before I put forward my views at the <b>Central Council</b> (next Tuesday, this time fortunately <em>without</em> <b>reporters</b> being present), I would appreciate it if you would let me know your opinion in a few lines.

</blockquote>
<br><em>Salut.</em>
<br>Your<br>K. M.
<br>Since Moses is a cousin of <em>Hirsch,</em> I am not surprised that he himself has a set of antlers. <b>He bears it proudly</b>.

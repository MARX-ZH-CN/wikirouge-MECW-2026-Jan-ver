ENGELS TO SARAH ALLEN</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London, about 6 July 1884]</p>
<p>Madam,</p>
<p>In reply to your note of the 5th arrived to hand yesterday and an answer to which was retarded by my absence from town, I beg to say that I consider Mr E. Aveling quite a desirable tenant and have no doubt that you will not regret having let your premises to him.
</p>

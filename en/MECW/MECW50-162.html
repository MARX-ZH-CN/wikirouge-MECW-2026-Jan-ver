ENGELS TO PANAIT MUSOIU</p>
<p>IN BUCHAREST</p>
<p>London, 20 March 1894 122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>Dear Comrade,</p>
<p>Owing to my absence from London<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>I have been prevented from answering your letter of 24 February any earlier. This I duly received as well as the <i>Manifestul comunist</i> and <i>Socialism utopic si socialism stüntific</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>for which very many thanks. Unfortunately I am not yet sufficiently versed in Romanian to be able to give an opinion on the merits of your translation. But I would caution you against taking the French translation as a basis when working on a German book.</p>
<p>Unfortunately time does not permit me to comply with your request that I write a preface to the new edition. I am busy putting the finishing touches to Volume III of Marx's <i>Capital</i> and, since printing is going rapidly ahead, I must devote all my time to the completion of the rest of the manuscript in order that no hold-ups should occur.</p>
<p>With kindest regards,</p>
<p>F. Engels

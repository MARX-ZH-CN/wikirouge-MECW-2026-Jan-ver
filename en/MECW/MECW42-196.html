<p>Dear Friend</p>
<p>A few lines at once.</p>
<p>1. To thank you for your efforts.</p>
<p>2. To tell you that I received this, as well as the previous letters.</p>
<p>3. You mistake my relations with Engels. He is my most intimate friend. I have <i>no secrets</i> from him. Had it not been for him I should long ago have been compelled to take up 'business'. Therefore in no circumstances do I want any third person to intervene with him on my account. He also, obviously, can only act within certain limits.</p>
<p>Dr Jakobi,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>I have been informed by workers, has become a very good citizen and consequently is not to be troubled in any way with my private affairs.</p>
<p>I must see about doing something, but I see that you have tried to do everything in your power, and therefore ask you to consider this affair settled.</p>
<p>I do <i>not</i> write for the <i>Commonwealth</i>.</p>
<p>Yours<br><b>KM</b></p>
<p>Miquel<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>and Co can wait a long time before they become Prussian ministers.</p>

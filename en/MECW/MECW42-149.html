MARX TO ENGELS
<br>IN MANCHESTER
<br>Margate, 2 April 1866<br>
5 Lansell's Place
<br>Dear FRED,
<br><i>D'abord</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> the £10 received with kindest thanks. In my absence there has been a <i>changement de décoration,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> or rather, <i>de direction</i> on <i>The Commonwealth</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> which will be realised next week. <i>Odger,</i> EDITOR; <i>FOX,</i> SUBEDITOR; the <b>SON OF TOIL"<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> <i> contracted to supply an article a week for 10s.; </i>Cremer<i> OUT OF PLACE; has also tendered his resignation as GENERAL SECRETARY of the </i></b><i>INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION.</i> Taken as a whole, I have no objection to the CHANGE. Eccarius could hardly have (or at least ought not to have) imagined that he would be allowed to retain nominal control from the moment the paper established itself. I warned him to no avail. It was a 'political' error on my part to have given way to his entreaties and proposed him by letter for his now defunct job. If I had not been ill, he would have knocked on the door in vain. I knew in advance that I would find the affair coming home to roost. Avoidance of any appearance of pursuing personal interests or abusing personal influence for clandestine purposes, and good understanding with the English must, of course, be more important to us than satisfying Eccarius' more or less justified ambition.
<br>People of a dry disposition like Eccarius also have a certain dry egoism, which easily leads them astray. When the REFORM LEAGUE decided on the big MEETING in St Martin's Hall,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> the League's COUNCIL nominated him as one of the PUBLIC SPEAKERS. The fellows in Potter's clique objected to him as a FOREIGNER. I warned him expressly not to accept his 'BRIEF'. However, he thought he had got over all his troubles and flattered himself with the important part in the METROPOLITAN MOVEMENT. And he was A DEAD FAILURE. The poor fellow has, of course, lived a life of DISAPPOINTMENTS, and the honorary positions the English SPONTANEOUSLY allowed him, as Vice-President of the 'INTERNATIONAL', etc., deceived him to the point where he now believed he could suddenly make up for the whole of his past life. If he had followed me, operated slowly, maintained a modest posture, everything would be in the best of order. If I even went so far as to muddy myself for his sake, despite his lack of discipline and his wilful behaviour, I was moved to do so particularly by the consideration that he has always worked with us and never reaped the fruits of it. But one always makes BLUNDERS if one allows oneself to be influenced by suchlike considerations.
<br>As regards the newspaper itself,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> the danger—arising from lack of funds—lies in the growing encroachments and dominance of the <i>Nonconformist</i> clique.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> <br>The accursed traditional nature of all English movements is manifesting itself again in the REFORM-MOVEMENT. The same 'INSTAL- MENTS' which but a few weeks ago were rejected with the utmost indignation by the people's party—they had even refused Bright's ultimatum of HOUSEHOLD SUFFRAGE—are now treated as a prize worthy to be fought for. And why? Because the Tories are screaming blue murder. These fellows lack the METTLE of the old Chartists.
<br>What d o you think of the Austro-Prussian troubles<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> ? I see n o continental papers at all. However, it is at least clear to me that Russia is behind the Prussians and that the Austrians, who know this, are <i>nolens volens</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> consoling themselves with French support. A pretty game these heads of state are playing! It is the eternal dilemma the German philistine confronts us with at every turn. For Bonaparte, real CIVIL WAR IN GERMANY would be a true GODSEND.
<br>Admittedly, there is still always the possibility that one fine day the affair will simply end with the worthy Bismarck's dismissal. But since Düppel, 'William the Conqueror'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> believes his 'glorious armies' are invincible, a n d a second Olmütz<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> must appear to be a risk even to him, in view of the INTERNAI, CONFLICT.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> <br>T h e weather has been very bad here for several days, as if it had been made especially to order for the COCKNEYS who have invaded this place for the Easter holiday.

<br>My friend Kaub has written to me from Paris that a certain M. Rebour has found a means to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen, using a method which would entail the expenditure of 2 sous per day FOR A FIRE TO MELT IRON WITH. He is, however, keeping the matter secret for the time being still, as on a previous occasion a discovery had been stolen from him and patented in London. <i>Qui vivra verra</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> You know how often we have both dreamed of a cheap way of making fire from water.

Despite the reorganisation the newspaper remained the official organ of the International Working Men's Association. It continued to publish reports of the Central Council meetings and other documents of the International. Marx remained on the Board of the Industrial Newspaper Company which owned the paper until 9 June 1866. Thanks to his efforts Eccarius, who became the editor of <i>The Workman's Advocate</i> not long before, retained his post. However, the reformist leaders of trade unions managed to paralyse the influence of Marx's supporters. In April 1866 George Odger was appointed its editor-in-chief. In issue No. 183, 8 September 1866, the newspaper declared itself to be the organ of the Reform League (see Note 155) and in fact fell under the influence of the radical bourgeoisie. It ceased publication on 20 July 1867.</span>

The Bismarck government regarded Austria as its main rival in the struggle for hegemony in Germany and sought for a <i>casus belli.</i> With this aim in view it accused Austria, which ruled Holstein, of encouraging the anti-Prussian movement there. Austria rejected Prussia's accusations and on 16 March 1866 sent a circular dispatch to several member states of the German Confederation (a union of German states founded by the Vienna Congress in 1815) asking for their mediation in the conflict or military assistance against Prussia. Prussia in its turn also sought the support of the German Confederation. In its circular dispatch of 24 March 1866 to the German states, the Prussian government proposed a reform of the political and military institutions of the German Confederation. Bismarck demagogically proposed that this reform be carried out through a German parliament elected on the basis of universal suffrage.</span>

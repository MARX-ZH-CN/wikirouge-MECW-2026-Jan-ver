MARX TO ENGELS
<br>IN MANCHESTER
<br>[London,] 11 December 1855 28 Dean Street, Soho
<br>DEAR Frederic,
<br>From Dana's letter, enclosed herewith, you will see that our manoeuvre has succeeded.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>Otherwise, everything as before. I still incarcerated. Jones not yet turned up.
<br>Bürgers will be allowed to move to another fortress if he pays the travelling expenses himself. Weerth had half promised Bürgers' mother in Cologne to send her money for him. Hasn't kept his word.
<br>Little Dronke corresponds regularly with Freiligrath. Had a great set-to with one of the partners, was on the point of giving up his post. To make himself look important, offered it to Freiligrath.
<br>Your
<br>K. M.

MARX TO ENGELS
<br>IN MANCHESTER
<br>[London,] 31 August 1864
<br>DEAR Frederick,
<br>I returned from Ramsgate<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> exactly three weeks ago today. The trip to Holland has fallen through, because a maid in my uncle's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> household suddenly contracted smallpox.
<br>Last week my wife had a severe attack of cholerine which did, for a spell, look like becoming dangerous. Yesterday she left for Brighton (solo).
<br>I have sundry letters from Liebknecht here which, however, I shall not send as I don't know whether you are in Manchester. The enclosed scrawl by Collet<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> will amuse you, and, should you not be there, it doesn't really matter. What naïveté on C.'s part! Since (to use an Austrian construction) I had done a long article on the RUSSIAN CLAIMS for him, which he <i>didn't</i> print, he expects me to take an interest in his ridiculous rubbish.
<br>The enclosed letter from Eisner is in reply to my wife's asking him for biographical notes on Lupus.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> <br>I've been operative again for a couple of days. Before that I was still troubled with sickness and INCAPABLE. If you haven't left yet, let us know at once. We hope to see you on your way through at any rate. The children send you their love. Jenny can hardly wait to show you her GREENHOUSE.
<br>I haven't yet quite made up my mind about the Schleswig-Holstein affair, and more facts will be needed before a clear picture can be gained of it. You were right when you predicted the rebirth of the Holy Alliance.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> Bonaparte would seem to have a strong 'inclination AT LEAST' to make 'a fourth in the alliance'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> Since the outbreak of the Polish revolution to date, the utter despicability of the fellow has Manifested itself in the clearest and most genuine light.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> <br>I've had an opportunity of looking at Grove's <i>Correlation of Physical Fqrces.</i> He is beyond doubt the most philosophical of the English (and indeed German!) natural scientists. Our friend Schleiden has an inborn-proclivity for <i>fadaise,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> although he, by mistake, discovered the cell.
<br>Herewith) Pieper's card.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> It accidentally fell into Liebknecht's hands and he has returned it to me.
<br><i>Salut.</i>
<br>Your
<br>K. M.
<br>Be so good as to send me Ernest Jones's Manchester address.
<br>DON'T FORGET!

Worried by the Prusso-Austro-Russian rapprochement and Prussia's stepped-up military activity in Denmark, the British government proposed that Britain and France take joint action against Prussian aggression. However, Napoleon III refused because of France's grave internal position and foreign-policy setbacks.</span>

ENGELS TO MARX<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>IN LONDON
<br>[Manchester, 20 or 21 July 1859]
<br>Dear Moor,
<br>Herewith the article.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> If it's too long cut it short somewhere and return me the manuscript of the <i>unprinted</i> portion so that I know where to start again.
<br>Also a POST OFFICE order made out to you, this being the three pounds for the <i>Volk.</i>
<br>The little man<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> pushes off tomorrow. He has bought the entire <i>Free Press</i> for 1859 as I have, ditto 1858. However much the Piccolo may chew away at it he won't digest a great deal. I asked him whether any money could be raised for the <i>Völkchen</i> in Glasgow; he thought <i>not.</i> I did this deliberately <i>en passant.</i> However, if you think it would serve some purpose I shall write to him; since tie has just been partially restored to grace, it may perhaps bear fruit and he can fork out at least a few pounds himself. But I wouldn't care to do this without consulting you, for there's no knowing what boasts the litde fellow might not subsequendy make with a letter like that in his pocket. This apart, <i>père</i> Freiligrath, too, ought to fork out a £5 note. If the louts can pay, so can he, and after all if our party has to support the paper out of its own money for the present, the fat philistine must also do his bit.
<br>Many regards to the FAMILY.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

It was written in reply to Marx's letter of 19 July 1859  (this volume, pp. 469-71) and answered by Marx on 22 July (pp. 472-74). So  the letter must have been written between these dates.</span>

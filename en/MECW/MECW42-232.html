<p><i>To Engels in Manchester</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 27 June 1867</b>
Dear <b>Fred</b>,</p>
<p>The 2 half £5-notes received with kindest thanks. With respect to the address, use <i>Borkheim.</i> He knows my situation, though with as much concealment as I consider necessary in his regard. I would even like him to know that you are lending me money. But you must write and tell me <i>when</i> the money is to be sent to him. I do not see why I should involve yet a 3rd philistine.</p>
<p>The <i>Fenians</i> should be delivered to you today.</p>
<p>I was so very pleased by your lines of yesterday, and that requires no further elaboration from me.</p>
<p>Sheet 20 [of the first volume of <i>Capital</i>] was the latest to reach me. It will probably run to 40 or 42 sheets in all. I've <i>not</i> as yet received <i>any corrected proofs</i> after the ones already sent you. On your departure send me back those which are in your possession.</p>
<p>Regarding the objection that you mentioned the philistines and vulgar economists will infallibly raise (they forget, of course, that, if they reckon <i>paid labour</i> as <i>wages,</i> they are reckoning <i>unpaid</i> labour as <i>profit</i>, etc.), it amounts, in scientific terms, to the following question:</p>
<p><i>How</i> is the <i>value</i> of the commodity <i>transformed</i> into its <i>price of production</i> in which</p>
<p>1. the <i>whole of the labour appears paid for</i> in the form of <i>wages;</i></p>
<p>2. the surplus-labour, however, or the surplus-value, assumes the form of an <i>addition to the price,</i> and goes by the name of interest, profit, etc., <i>over and above</i> the <i>cost-price</i> (= price of the constant part of capital + wages).</p>
<p>Answering this question presupposes:</p>
<p>I. That the <i>transformation</i> of, for example, the <i>value of a day's labour-power</i> into <i>wages or the price of a day's labour</i> has been explained. This is done in <i>Chapter V</i> of this volume.</p>
<p>II. That the <i>transformation of surplus-value</i> into <i>profit</i>, and of <i>profit into average profit</i>, etc., has been explained. This presupposes that the <i>process of the circulation of capital</i> has been previously explained, since the turnover of capital, etc., plays a part here. This matter cannot therefore be treated prior to the 3rd book <i>(Volume II</i> is to contain books 2 and 3). Here it will be shown how the philistines' and vulgar economists' <i>manner of conceiving things</i> arises, namely, because the only thing that is ever reflected in their minds is the immediate <i>form of appearance</i> of relations, and not their <i>inner connection</i>. Incidentally, if the latter were the case, we would surely have no need of <i>science</i> at all.</p>
<p>Now if I wished to <i>refute</i> all such objections in <i>advance,</i> I should spoil the whole dialectical method of exposition. On the contrary, the good thing about this method is that it is constantly <i>setting traps</i> for those fellows which will provoke them into an untimely display of their idiocy.</p>
<p>By the by, Para. 3: '<i>The Rate of Surplus Value',</i> which was the last one you had in your possession, is immediately followed by the Para.: '<i>The Working Day'</i> (struggle for the reduction of working time), whose argument demonstrates <i>ad oculus</i> to what extent those bourgeois gentlemen comprehend the source and nature of their profit in <i>practice.</i> This is also shown in the <i>Senior</i> <b>case</b>, where your bourgeois assures us that his whole profit and interest derive from the <i>last unpaid hour of labour.</i></p>
<p>Kindest regards to <b>Mrs</b> Lizzy.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>You must stop over for a few days here on your journey home.</p>
<p>Apropos. I judged it in every way imprudent to take Mr <i>Meissner</i> into my confidence regarding my private circumstances.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<hr/><p><b>Dear Fred</b>,</p>
<p>The children send you their best thanks.</p>
<p>I have written to Meissner today that the 'Leipzig' method cannot continue in this fashion. I've had <i>nothing</i> since Monday. The proofs have been reaching me most irregularly throughout, so that I am for ever being interrupted in other work and am for ever kept quite pointlessly on tenterhooks. Having perhaps received 1 sheet in a whole week, <i>on Saturday evening</i> I at last get a successor which is too late for me to send off. I have written to Meissner that Wigand must send a <i>minimum</i> of 3 sheets <i>on certain agreed days,</i> but that he is always welcome to send <i>more</i> at <b>anytime</b>.</p>
<p>If I get 13th and 14th sheets of the corrected copy in time, you shall have them on Sunday. I would have liked you to see my dressing-down of Senior and my introduction to the analysis of the <i>working day</i> before your departure. Incidentally, the section on the 'Working Day' occupies 5 printed sheets, which do, of course, contain predominantly factual material. To show you how closely I have followed your advice in my treatment of the appendix, I'll now copy out for you the divisions, sections, headings, etc., of same appendix.

<h4 class="mw-headline" id="ME42-232-3">The Form of Value</h4>
<h5 class="mw-headline" id="ME42-232-4">I. Simple Form of Value</h5>
<p>§ 1. The two poles of the expression of value: relative form and equivalent form of value.</p>
<p>a. Inseparability of the two forms.</p>
<p>b. Polarity of the two forms.</p>
<p>c. Relative value and equivalent, both being but forms of value.</p>
<p>§ 2. The relative form of value.</p>
<p>a. The relation of equality.</p>
<p>b. Value-relations.</p>
<p>c. Qualitative content of the relative form of value implied in value-relations.</p>
<p>d. Quantitative determination of the relative form of value implied in value-relations.</p>
<p>e. The relative form of value considered as a whole.</p>
<p>§ 3. The equivalent form.</p>
<p>a. The form of direct exchangeability.</p>
<p>b. Quantitative determination not contained in the equivalent form.</p>
<p>c. The peculiarities of the equivalent form.</p>
<p>a. First peculiarity: use-value becomes the form of appearance of its opposite, value.</p>
<p>b. Second peculiarity: concrete labour becomes the form of appearance of its opposite, abstract human labour.</p>
<p>c. Third peculiarity: private labour takes the form of its opposite, namely, labour in its directly social form.</p>
<p>d. Fourth peculiarity: the fetishism of the commodity-form more striking in the equivalent form than in the relative value-form.</p>
<p>§ 4. The form of value or independent manifestation of value = exchange value.</p>
<p>§ 5. Simple form of value of the commodity-- simple manifestation of the contradictions it contains within itself between use-value and value.</p>
<p>§ 6. Simple form of value of the commodity =simple form of an object as commodity.</p>
<p>§ 7. Relationship between commodity-form and money-form.</p>
<p>§ 8. Simple relative form of value and individual equivalent form.</p>
<p>§ 9. Transition of the simple into the expanded form of value.
</p>
<h5 class="mw-headline" id="ME42-232-5">II. Total or Expanded Form of Value</h5>
<p>§ 1. The endless series -of relative expressions of value.</p>
<p>§ 2. Sequential determination implied in the expanded relative form of value.</p>
<p>§ 3. Defects of the expanded relative form of value.</p>
<p>§ 4. Expanded relative form of value and specific equivalent form.</p>
<p>§ 5. Transition to the general form of value.
</p>
<h5 class="mw-headline" id="ME42-232-6">III. The General Form of Value</h5>
<p>§ 1. Altered character of the relative form of value.</p>
<p>§ 2. Altered character of the equivalent form.</p>
<p>§ 3. Concurrent development of relative form of value and equivalent form.</p>
<p>§ 4. Development of the polarity between relative form of value and equivalent form.</p>
<p>§ 5. Transition from the general form of value to the money-form.
</p>
<h5 class="mw-headline" id="ME42-232-7">IV. The Money-Form</h5>
<p>(The following on the money-form is simply for the sake of continuity — perhaps barely half a page.)</p>
<p>§ 1. How the transition from the general form of value to the money-form differs from the previous transitions in the development.</p>
<p>§ 2. Transformation of the relative form of value into the price form.</p>
<p>§ 3. The simple form of commodity is the secret of the money-form.</p>
<p>You may sprinkle sand on this!</p>
<p>Your<br>K. Moro</p>
<p>Don't forget to drop a line to Borkheim before you depart, so that no 'misunderstanding' is possible.</p>
<p>Regarding the <i>English translation</i> [of <i>Capital</i>], I am trying to track down a fellow in London who will <i>pay decently,</i> so that both Moro as translator and I as author get our due. If I am successful, <b>Mrs</b> Lizzy shall also receive her share (you <b>must in that case</b> allow me that pleasure — but the bird is not yet in the hand) in the form of a London <b>dress</b>. I have some expectations, as Mssrs Harrison et Co. are most desirous to study the book <i>in English.</i> Eccarius has, of course, told them that he is <b>a humble</b> Pupil <b>of mine —</b> (his critique of Mill has impressed them hugely, they having previously been believers in Mill) — and that the Prophet Himself is <b>just now</b> having the quintessence of all wisdom published, that is printed, in Germany.</p>
<p>I am quite sickened by the <b>report</b> on the <b>Fenians</b>. These swine boast of their English humanity in not treating political prisoners <i>worse</i> than murderers, street-thieves, forgers and pederasts! And this O'Donovan Rossa, what '<b>a queer fellow',</b> because as a <b>felony convict</b> he refused to grovel before his worst enemies! <b>A queer fellow indeed</b>! Incidentally, would even the Prussians have been capable of acting in a more bureaucratic fashion than these emissaries of the <b>weeping willow</b>, that Knox (read ox) and Pollock (<b>bull-dog</b>), who naturally accept the evidence given by the <b>subordinate 'warder'</b> as unimpeachable. But if you don't believe the <b>warders</b>, you have the word of Wermuth, the chief of police!</p>
<p><b>Mrs</b> S O'Donovan Rossa has written the '<b>International' a very flattering and very graceful letter</b> on her departure for America.</p>
<p>The fury of that Bismarck-oracle, the <i>Norddeutsche,</i> at Stanley's and Derby's statements about the Luxemburg <b>Treaty</b> has quite cured my nausea. That jackass Brass calls it an innovation! Palmerston has <b>laid down</b> once and for all the principle that <b>common treaties</b> impose only the right and not by any means <i>the</i> duty of intervention <b>for any state</b>. And if that were not so, whatever <b>became</b> of the <b>obligations</b> which England assumed at the Congress of Vienna with regard to <i>Poland</i>, in respect of both Prussia and Russia, and France ditto?

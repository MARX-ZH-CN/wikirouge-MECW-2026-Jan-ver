MARX TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>IN LEIPZIG</p>
<p>London, [around 10 April]<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> 1871</p>
<p>Dear Wilhelm,</p>
<p>Just two notices in great haste which you could surely arrange to put into the <i>Volksstaat:</i></p>
<p>1. In the <i>Papiers et correspondance de la famille impériale,</i> now officially published, there is a reference under the letter V (the recipients of money are arranged alphabetically) which states <i>verbo tenus</i>:</p>
<p><b>Vogt<i>—</i>il lui est remis en août 1859 40,000 francs.</b><i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> </i></p>
<p>2. Whereas the Bismarck government in Germany has made correspondence with me into a more or less highly penal affair <i>(vide</i> the Brunswick trial,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> just like the Cologne Communist trial of earlier years 138), in France it attempts to discredit me (and with me the <i>International in Paris</i>—that is the <i>aim</i> of the whole manoeuvre) by branding me as one of <i>Mr Bismarck's agents.</i> This is done through the organs of the old-Bonapartist police which is still entwined by international bonds with Stieber's police— particularly under the Thiers regime.</p>
<p>In consequence I have been compelled to publish denials in <i>The Times</i> of various lies that have appeared in the <i>Paris-Journal,</i> the <i>Gaulois,</i> and so on, because the rubbish is reported to the English press <i>by telegraph.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> The latest example was provided by the <i>Soir</i> (the paper of About, the well-known Plonplonist<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> ), which has only very recently been suppressed by the Commune, and from the</p>
<p><i>Soir</i> it circulated to all the French reactionary press throughout the provinces. E.g. today I received from Laura (BY THE BY, Lafargue is at this moment in Paris as a delegate from Bordeaux) the following extract from the paper <i>La Province</i> (and yesterday I received the same piece from a clerical newspaper in <i>Belgium): 'Paris, 2 April.</i> A piece of news just arrived from Germany is causing a great sensation here. Authentic proof is now to hand to show that Karl Marx, one of the most influential leaders of the <i>International,</i> was <i>the private secretary of Count Bismarck</i> in 1857, and has never ceased to remain in contact with his former <i>patron.'"</i></p>
<p>Stieber really is becoming a 'terror'!</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

However, this amnesty was hedged round with numerous reservations, which caused Engels to compare it with the shabby amnesty of political prisoners announced in Prussia in January 1861 on the occasion of William I's accession to the throne.</span>

Under pressure from Nicholas I, Emperor of Russia, Prussia renounced her plans for suppressing the uprising in the Electorate of Hesse and complied with Austrian demands.<br>On the initiative of Nicholas I negotiations between the Austrian Chancellor Prince von Schwarzenberg and the Prussian Prime Minister Count von Brandenburg had taken place in Warsaw in October 1850. The point at issue was the conflict between Austria and Prussia over supremacy in Germany. During this meeting Nicholas I intimated that he was firmly on Austria's side.</span>

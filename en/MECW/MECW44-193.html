MARX TO ADOLPHE HUBERT</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 12 February 1872</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p>Herewith the notes: Old Crémieux has been in London where he put up at the Golden Cross Hotel with a gentleman whom he caused to be entered in the hotel register as his son, but who is in reality Mr Truchy, a former captain on the General Staff, a Bonapartist in search of a fortune, and editor of the <i>Liberté</i> (Girardin's), to which he was appointed by Badinguet<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>and for which he writes military articles under the <i>nam de plume</i> of Mousselerès.</p>
<p>These gentry were in London to settle some business with the man at Chislehurst.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>The result of the transactions was old man Crémieux's nomination as one of the members of the Regency of the Empire (in the event of Badinguet's death).</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

<p>On my seventieth birthday I received so many messages of sincere support, so many unexpected testimonials, that it will unfortunately be impossible for me to answer each message personally. There was a veritable torrent of telegrams, letters, gifts, articles  devoted specially to me in the party press of many different countries, but particularly in all parts of Germany. Therefore allow me to express thus my most sincere thanks to the friends old and new who remembered me so appreciatively on November 28.</p>
<p>Nobody knows better than I that the greater part of these testimonials were not due to me and my own services. It is my fate that I must harvest the glory and the honour the seed for which was sown by Karl Marx, a greater man than me. So I can only pledge myself to devote the remainder of my life to the active service  of the proletariat, so that I may, if possible, make myself belatedly worthy of these honours.</p>
<p>London, December 2 , 1890</p>

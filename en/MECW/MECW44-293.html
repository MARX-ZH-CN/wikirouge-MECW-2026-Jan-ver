ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE</p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>London, 22 March 1873</p>
<p>Dear Sorge,</p>
<p>I wrote to you on the 20th inst.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>and am today sending <i>Emancipación</i> No. 89 and <i>International Herald</i> No. 51.</p>
<p>I forgot to add when talking of the $20 not sent to Lodi that during their period of difficulties, those people had received the following:</p>
<p>from here 50 frs from the Committee of the Social- Democratic Workers' Party, 20 thalers 75<br>
" from Oberwinder in Vienna 50 florins 125 "</p>
<p>Total<br>
250 francs</p>
<p>I thought this was sufficient for a situation with such a favourable outcome: 3 were released after two weeks and only Bignami was in custody for circa 6 weeks.</p>
<p>The resolution of 26 January<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>and the Address to the Spaniards have been sent off to Lodi.</p>
<p>As you can see from the <i>Emancipación,</i> the Address to the Spaniards was very well received.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE
<br>IN HOBOKEN
<br>London, 22 March 1873
<br>Dear Sorge,
<br>I wrote to you on the 20th inst.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and am today sending <i>Emancipación</i> No. 89 and <i>International Herald</i> No. 51.
<br>I forgot to add when talking of the $20 not sent to Lodi that during their period of difficulties, those people had received the following:
<br>from here 50 frs from the Committee of the Social- Democratic Workers' Party, 20 thalers 75<br>
" from Oberwinder in Vienna 50 florins 125 "
<br>Total<br>
250 francs
<br>I thought this was sufficient for a situation with such a favourable outcome: 3 were released after two weeks and only Bignami was in custody for circa 6 weeks.
<br>The resolution of 26 January<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and the Address to the Spaniards have been sent off to Lodi.
<br>As you can see from the <i>Emancipación,</i> the Address to the Spaniards was very well received.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <br>Best wishes,
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

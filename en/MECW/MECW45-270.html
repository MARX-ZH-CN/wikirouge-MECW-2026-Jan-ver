MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Ramsgate, 9 September 1879<br>62 Plains of Waterloo</p>
<p>Dear FRED,</p>
<p>Various INCIDENTS have meant that money is visibly running out, whereas I wish to spend another week here,<sup>00</sup> despite the weather which, since Sunday evening, has been very uncertain.</p>
<p>You will hear more about our sojourn here, which has done me, in particular, a great deal of good, from the Lafargues.</p>
<p>Enclosed a letter from Sorge. Since I haven't got Becker's address with me, and you are corresponding with him anyhow, PLEASE write and tell him to send me the form for the <i>power of attorney.</i></p>
<p>How are things with Jollymeyer?</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

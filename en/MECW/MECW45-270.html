MARX TO ENGELS
<br>IN LONDON
<br>Ramsgate, 9 September 1879<br>62 Plains of Waterloo
<br>Dear FRED,
<br>Various INCIDENTS have meant that money is visibly running out, whereas I wish to spend another week here,<sup>00</sup> despite the weather which, since Sunday evening, has been very uncertain.
<br>You will hear more about our sojourn here, which has done me, in particular, a great deal of good, from the Lafargues.
<br>Enclosed a letter from Sorge. Since I haven't got Becker's address with me, and you are corresponding with him anyhow, PLEASE write and tell him to send me the form for the <i>power of attorney.</i>
<br>How are things with Jollymeyer?
<br>Your
<br>K. M.

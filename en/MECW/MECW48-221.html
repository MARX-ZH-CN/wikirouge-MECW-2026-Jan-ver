ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>[London,] 12 October 1889</p>
<p>Herewith as usual the <i>Labour Elector</i> and <i>Commonweal.</i></p>
<p>The <i>International Review</i> is said to have already met its end, thus quickly has Hyndman ruined it by his mismanagement. Bax, however, is in negotiation over another revue<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> ; if he acquires it, Aveling will probably be his assistant editor. The revolution in New York<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> gets funnier and funnier; the attempts by Rosenberg &amp; Co. to remain on top <i>à tout prix,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> while amusing, are fortunately doomed to failure. Your exchanges with the nationalists<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> in the <i>Workmen's Advocate</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> have gladdened me, firstly because one can recognise old Sorge from 10 miles off and, secondly, because they have once more provided me with <i>public</i> proof of your existence.</p>
<p>I don't know whether I wrote and told you that Sam Moore left for Asaba on the Niger (Africa) in June as Chief Justice for the territories of the English Niger Company. I received the first letter from there yesterday; he finds the climate very good and apparently salubrious; the heat is not very great—75° F in the mornings and 81°-83°<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> in the afternoons. Cool, therefore, by comparison with New York. Thus the 3rd volume of <i>Capital</i> will probably be translated into English in Africa. I am working on the 4th edition of the 1st volume; the quotations are all having to be revised to conform to the English edition, but it can't be helped. After that I shall buckle down to the 3rd.</p>
<p>Longuet arrived yesterday to fetch his two elder boys,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> who have been staying with Tussy. As a result of the Opportunists'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> abstention he polled 800 votes fewer than his opponent. Of our people about 6 were elected, but not, alas, Guesde.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

National Secretary W. Rosenberg and several members of the Executive were removed from the leadership. A sequel to the ensuing split was the holding of two separate conventions in Chicago. The convention of 12 October 1889, held by a group of party members who had rallied around the newspaper New Yorker Volkszeitung, adopted a new party programme that reflected the views of its progressive wing.</span>

Gambetta, had said that reforms were to be implemented at 'an opportune time' ('un temps opportun').</span>

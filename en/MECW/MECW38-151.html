<br>[Manchester,] Thursday, 27 February 1851
<br>Dear Marx,
<br>When last night at 12 o'clock I arrived home and found your letter with its account of the infamy perpetrated upon Schramm and Pieper<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> , I at once sent off to you a letter for Harney. From that letter, the shaky hand, the passionate indignation, the bumbling, stumbling train of thought and the not exactly harmonious whole, it will have been evident to you that it was written under the influence of a glass or two of strong rum-punch which I had unwontedly imbibed that evening, and you will therefore not have sent it off. <i>In fact</i>, I was so enraged that I couldn't have gone to bed without sending it off and hence, more to calm myself than to convey my opinion in all haste to Harney, I dashed off to the post at 1 o'clock. You'll have received the letter around midday today, and since today there's no post until the evening, it has not been possible to send you another letter before this one. I now enclose an amended letter for Harney, which you will kindly convey to him if, as I hope, you haven't yet forwarded the first.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>In future address letters to me as follows:
<br>1. All letters which you send from the Charing Cross office before six in the evening, or before half past five from smaller offices, to the office (Ermen and Engels). Then I shall get them at 10 in the morning.
<br>2. All letters posted after 6 o'clock in the evening to Great Ducie Street. I shall get them the following evening at 6 o'clock, whereas in the office I wouldn't get them until the following morning.
<br>Hühnerbein wrote to me recently. Mirbach got away safely and is leaving Paris to follow his wife to Athens.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

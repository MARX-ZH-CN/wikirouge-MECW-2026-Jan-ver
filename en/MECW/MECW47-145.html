ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY</p>
<p>IN VIENNA</p>
<p>London, 13 January 1885</p>
<p>Dear Kautsky,</p>
<p>I trust this will still catch you in Vienna. It was only a day or two ago that I received the 1st number of the <i>Neue Zeit.</i> Can you get hold of about 2 or 3 more copies for me? Having promised Rudolf Meyer my critique of Rodbertus,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I can hardly send him a copy — the poor conservative social muddle-head is on tenterhooks — without also doing Mme Lafargue and Tussy the same service.</p>
<p>I would also ask you to send me copies of the <i>Poverty of Philosophy</i> for the above. The thing is advertised as having 'appeared'.</p>
<p>Groß would appear to be a blockhead, though an honest one. I have nothing against the biography; if you intend to lambast him for his confusion over theory, I don't envy you your task.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Give Frankel my kind regards. No doubt you will tell me what he is in fact up to.</p>
<p>The New Year's card he and the others sent me gave me much pleasure.</p>
<p>Well, that's all until you come over here.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F.E.</p>
<p>With an editor like D<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> you wouldn't have stuck it even for a fortnight. Better to come over here, rather than make yourself yet another deadly enemy in the parliamentary group.

<br>Dear Engels,
<br>The papers have been sent to you. If this was not done sooner the fault lies with that jackass Korff who, because I was overworked, a circumstance aggravated by repeated summonses, has so far failed to carry out my orders.
<br>In the meantime remain in Berne. I shall write to you as soon as you can come. Seal your letters better. One of them had been opened, as I indicated in the paper, without, of course, mentioning your name. [Marx, 'Letters Opened']
<br>Write in detail about <em>Proudhon</em> and, since your geography is good, about the dirty business in Hungary (nations swarming like bees). [Engels, Proudhon and The Magyar Struggle] Don't forget me [i.e., The Poverty of Philosophy] in the piece on Proudhon, since our articles are reprinted by a great many French newspapers.
<br>Write something, too, attacking the Federal Republic, to which end Switzerland provides the best opportunity. [Engels, The National Council]
<br>K. Heinzen has published his old trashy piece attacking us. [K. Heinzen, Die Helden des teutschen Kommunismus, 1848]
<br>Our paper continues to stand by the principle of <em>émeute</em> [uprising], but despite all my summonses in court, it has succeeded in sailing clear of the <em>Code pénal</em>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> It is now very much en vogue. We are also issuing posters daily.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <em>La révolution marche</em>. Write diligently.
<br>I have devised an infallible plan for extracting money from your old man, as we now have none. Write me a begging letter (as crude as possible), in which you retail your past vicissitudes, but in such a way that I can pass it on to your mother. The old man's beginning to get the wind up.
<br>I hope to see you again soon.
<br>Your<br>Marx

ENGELS TO OSCAR HEIDFELD</p>
<p>IN LIVERPOOL</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London,] 12 November 1891</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>...I still hold the documents mentioned in your letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> but they are of no value whatever now, the policy having lapsed long since through Mr Dronke's failing to pay the premiums as he ought to have done. The very first premium due in November 1877 I did pay expecting to be repaid by him, but when I applied for the money he never replied, nor have I been able ever since to make out his address, though my Manchester solicitors took every trouble to find him out. Under these circumstances, and in view of the almost certainty that the gradual payment with interest on the same and on the original loan would eat up more than any possible return for the policy, there was nothing left to me but to let the policy drop.</p>
<p>From what you tell me I must conclude that the same result would have been arrived at had he not pledged the policy.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> </p>

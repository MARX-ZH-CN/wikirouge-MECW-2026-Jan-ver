MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 12 October [1852] 28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Frederic,</p>
<p>More about your letter later. Enclosed:</p>
<p>1. A document, 'The German Loan Star Society', smuggled into the <i>Advertiser</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> by Ruge-Ronge.</p>
<p>2. A cutting from Weydemeyer's <i>Lithographierte Correspondenz</i> about the effect of this dangerous 'SOCIETY' on their League congress at Wheeling.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>3. An article for Dana.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> But the whole of it must go off, as I have a mass of political stuff for next time. I had a bad headache when I was scribbling the thing. So don't be afraid to deal with it FREELY in translating.</p>
<p>You may have read the infamous article in yesterday's <i>Times</i>, a contribution dated Berlin.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> All the cur has done is to translate from the <i>Neue Preussische Zeitung</i> (the Cologne trial) and add one or two scurrilous comments from his own STOCK.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. Marx

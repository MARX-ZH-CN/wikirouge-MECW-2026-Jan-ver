ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>IN HUBERTUSBURG</p>
<p>London, 12 February 1873</p>
<p>Dear Liebknecht,</p>
<p>Before I can give you a definite answer to the many questions in your letter, I must first know exactly what you mean by saying that 'the <i>Volksstaat</i> cannot become involved in International polemics at the present time'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> If the <i>Volksstaat</i> proclaims itself <i>neutral</i> in the International's war against the secessionists, if it refuses to explain these events clearly to the German workers, if, in a word, the Lassallean revolt is to be concluded by your shaking hands over and beyond the International and by your sacrificing the International and Yorck to the Hasselmanns, then our attitude to the <i>Volksstaat</i> will <i>change fundamentally.</i> So I must ask you to speak out frankly at once.</p>
<p>About my book,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> negotiations are pending with Wigand and I would have to free myself from him before deciding on any alternative. But on the general issue of letting you have the rights to practically all our earlier writings gratis at the very moment when we are in a position to make money from them, I would ask you to bear in mind that we too need money, firstly in order to live, and secondly in order to meet the daily mounting costs of agitation, propaganda material, etc. The essays by Marx and myself will certainly be collected and printed, but at the moment we have no time to take care of it ourselves. I am even less in a position to distil the essence of Owen's works for you. In the first place I do not have the time and in the second, I lack the material—my collection of Owen's writings went astray in 1848-49, and these things are no longer obtainable.—At all events the <i>Misère de la philosophie</i> is being reprinted in Paris; as to the German translation, Marx is negotiating with Meissner about a complete edition of earlier writings and so can hardly just take out one of the largest works without further ado. And anyway, you have plenty of time before you get from the <i>Utopia</i> to us; better look after the intermediate links first.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I cannot conceal from you the fact that our treatment at the hands of the 'Party' does absolutely nothing to encourage us to entrust even more of our writings to it. I have not been sent even a single copy of my <i>Peasant War;</i> I had to <i>purchase</i> the copies I needed for myself. I am not even consulted about the publication of the articles on the housing shortage,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> whether they should come out separately or together.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> When I asked for free copies of the <i>Manifesto</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> for us and for the Workers' Society here—in recognition of their having reprinted it three times at their own expense—we were sent 100 copies <i>together with the bill.</i> I have written to Hepner about that<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> and now request once and for all that this boorish treatment should cease.</p>
<p>I shall try and unearth a copy of the <i>Utopia</i> (in English), but it may be difficult as all the old popular editions were bought up long since.</p>
<p>I must close here and regret that I am prevented by the need to catch the post from enclosing a few lines to your wife.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> Please be kind enough to make my excuses. Does your family still live at 11 Braustrasse? We have only that address and the <i>Volksstaat.</i></p>
<p>With best wishes from your</p>
<p>F. E.

The letter outlined a plan to publish a popular 'social and political library', which was to open with Thomas More's <i>Utopia.</i> It was also to comprise a number of Marx's and Engels' works. Liebknecht was making enquiries as to their reprinting. No such library, however, was established in the 1870s.</span>

On 27 February 1873, replying to Engels' demand for an explanation of this, Liebknecht wrote that he had had in mind the paper's limited space and its difficult position following the arrest of its editors.</span>

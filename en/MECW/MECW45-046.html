MARX TO PYOTR LAVROV</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 8 May 1875</p>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p>I have just received a letter from a Berlin businessman<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> (a very upright man and of no political importance at all, at any rate in the eyes of the world and the police), who asks me to explain to him some points in <i>Capital.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> When replying to him, which I did at once, I took the opportunity of requesting, in my turn, that he give me a safe address for your letters from Russia.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> My letter will go off today.</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Carl August Schramm</span>
</li>
<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Marx is most probably referring to Schramm's letter of 31 March 1875, in which the latter wrote of his intention to contribute a series of popular articles about<i> Capital</i> to<i> Der Volksstaat.</i> Schramm requested Marx to explain to him some points on the theory of ground rent. Judging from Schramm's letter to Marx of 14 May (see Note 91), Marx actually did so, but his letter, written between 8 and 14 May, has not been found. The following year, Schramm published a book,<i> Grundzüge der National Oekonomie.</i> Abth. 1, Leipzig, 1876, a copy of which he probably sent to Marx. This book has been found in Marx's library.</span>
</li>
<li id="cite_note-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-3">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Replying to Marx, Schramm wrote on 14 May 1875: 'Many thanks for your kind and detailed letter which is particularly valuable to me in view of its explanations of ground rent. As you requested, I am sending you the desired addresses below: the owners, Bamberger and Bernstein, are both known to me personally, and I think I can vouch for their reliability.'<br>Probably a reference to the Berlin wholesale firm of<i> Bamberger &amp; Co., Leinen- und Baumwollwaren engros,</i> Breitestraße 22. It was owned jointly by Jacob Bamberger and Ad. Bernstein.</span>

<p>ENGELS TO STANISLAV MENDELSON</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 22 May 1894<br>
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.</p>
<p>My dear Mendelson, I have received a long letter from Georgi Plekhanov which contains many things with regard to you and the Polish movement. I intended to read it to you last Sunday, but I have learned that Mme Mendelson was taken ill and that therefore you had to stay at home. If this be convenient to you, I shall come to see you the day after tomorrow, Thursday, from 2 to 2.30 in the afternoon, together with Mme Freyberger, who would like to see how Mme Mendelson is feeling.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>F. Engels</p>
<p>Our compliments to Mme Mendelson, who, we hope, is doing better.
</p>

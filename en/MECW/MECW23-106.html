<blockquote>
<br>These notes were presumably written by Marx in connection with the measures taken by the General Council of the International to organise aid for the refugees of the Paris Commune (see Note 50).

</blockquote>
<br>460 (foreigners) arrested on the fall of the Commune. 5 months on the pontoons. Order of nonsuit.
<br>Disembarked at Newhaven; had not received any food on the boat. They were released scarcely clothed, without money, told to apply to their respective consuls for help in getting out of their plight.
<br>Made their way, partly on foot, from Newhaven to London.

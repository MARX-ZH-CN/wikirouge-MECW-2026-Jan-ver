ENGELS TO HUGO KOCH</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London, about 22 September 1887]</p>
<p>Dear Mr Koch,</p>
<p>I have lately wasted so much time replying to anonymous tittle-tattle that I have made it a rule to reply only to such rumours as are substan- tiated by those who spread them. Before I can reply to your query, therefore, I must ask you to tell me:</p>
<p>1. <i>To whom</i> I am alleged to have made the remarks in question, 2. <i>who</i> passed them on to you.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully</p>
<p>F. E.

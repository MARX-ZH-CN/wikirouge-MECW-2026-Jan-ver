<p><i>To Joseph Weydemeyer in New York</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 30 January 1852, 28 Dean Street, Soho</b></p>
<p>Dear Weydemeyer,</p>
<p>Enclosed you will find:</p>
<p>1. A further instalment of my article.</p>
<p>2. A piece by Eccarius whose grammatical mistakes, punctuation and so forth you yourself will have to correct, since he brought me the thing too late for me to attend to this myself.</p>
<p>3. Translation of an interesting article in <i>The Times</i> by Lupus who, however, does not wish his name to appear, the thing being merely a translation.</p>
<p>How goes, it with the German book-trade in America? Might I find a publisher there for my Economy now that things have miscarried in Germany?</p>
<p><i>Salut</i>.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. Marx
</p>

MARX TO MAXIM KOVALEVSKY
<br>IN MOSCOW
<br>London, 9 January 1877<br>41 Maitland Park Road, N. W.
<br>My dear Friend,
<br>I have learned that a Russian lady<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> who has rendered the party important services is unable for want of money to find a lawyer in Moscow for her husband.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I know neither the husband in question, nor whether he is guilty or not. But a consequence of the trial could be exile in Siberia and, since Mrs... is determined to follow her husband, whom she considers innocent, it is most important that she should at least be provided with the means for his defence. Since Mrs... has left the management of her fortune to her husband and is wholly uninformed about such matters, only a lawyer could set things right.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <br>Mr Taneyev, whom you know and whom I have long esteemed as a devoted friend of the emancipation of the people is, perhaps, the only lawyer in Moscow who would take on so thankless a case. You would greatly oblige me by asking him to concern himself with our friend's exceptionally unfortunate situation.
<br>Yours ever,
<br>Karl Marx

<p><i>Cologne,</i> November 22. We have heard from private sources that the <i>Left</i> and the <i>Left</i> Centre of the National Assembly in Frankfurt decided yesterday evening at a closed sitting <i>to withdraw, to constitute themselves a democratic committee for Germany, and at</i> <i>the same time to issue an appeal to the German people.</i></p>
<p>In publishing this information, we do not guarantee its authenticity, but we are convinced this is the only course open to the Left and the Left Centre. Were they not to take it, they would be signing their own death warrants.

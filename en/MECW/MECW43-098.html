<p>My dear Friend</p>
<p>Since at this moment, when your letter arrives, I am plagued with a visit, I shall write just these few lines.</p>
<p>Kertbeny's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> address: No I/III (what the III means I do not know; perhaps, third floor) Behrenstrasse.</p>
<p>Now permit me a word. Since you and Engels were of the opinion that it would be useful, I gave way to having this advertisement in the <em>Gartenlaube</em>. I was <em>decisively opposed to it</em>. And now I ask you <em>urgently</em>, <em>to give up</em> this joke <em>definitely</em>. It leads to nothing except that fellows like Keil and 'Daheim' believe that one belongs to the pack of great literary and other men, and needs or desires their protection.</p>
<p>I think it is more harmful than useful and beneath the dignity of a scientific man. For example, Meyer's <em>Konversationslexikon</em> wrote asking me for a biography a long time ago. Not only did I not send one, but I did not even answer their letter. Everybody must reach salvation in his own way. As for Kertbeny, he is a confused, boastful, importunate literary idler and the less one has to do with him, the better.</p>
<p>

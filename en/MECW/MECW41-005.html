ENGELS TO MARX<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>IN LONDON
<br>Manchester, 26 January 1860
<br>Dear Moor,
<br>Tomorrow being <i>Tribune</i> day,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I'm sorry that there should again be no material to hand; the few notes on Morocco in <i>The Times"</i> don't even run to the engagement at Cabo-Negro,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> nor has anything else happened. However, you'll have enough material with the parliamentary stuff.<sup>1</sup>' I am still waiting to hear about the reform of the Prussian army as well.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> <br>Your opinion of the importance of the slave movement in America and Russia<sup>1</sup> is already being confirmed. The Harpers- Ferry affair,'" with its sequel in Missouri,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> is bearing fruit. Everywhere the free NIGGERS'<sup>1</sup> in the South are being hounded out of the states, and I have just seen from the first New York cotton report (W. P. Wright &amp; Co of 10 January 1860)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> that the planters HURRIED their cotton ON TO EHE PORTS IN ORDER TO GUARD AGAINST ANY PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES ARISING OUI OE THE HARPERS-FERRY AFFAIR. I n R u s s i a, tOO, t h e confusion is growing admirably; the Augsburg <i>Allgemeine Zeitung's</i> St. Petersburg correspondent is very good on this subject, though he pays more attention to the constitutional movement among the aristocracy,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> which, however, also provides a certain impetus for the peasants, of course.
<br>In India we have the makings of a tremendous crisis. As far as the views of the local philistines on the subject are concerned, CONFER the enclosed MARKET REPORTS. NOW yarn prices are mostly so high, almost higher than the peak in 1857, and yet cotton is 2'7s to 2 V2d <i>cheaper.</i> Twenty-six new mills are under construction in Burnley alone, and a proportionate number in other places. Everywhere, by degrees, the workers are getting a 10% rise in wages and will shortly receive even more. In my view, the practice of operating on fictitious capital is again just as RIKE in Indian business as it was in 1846/47, and most people are buying only because they <i>have</i> to, and cannot stop. But, even if that were not so, the increase in production alone will bring about a colossal COLLAPSE this autumn or in the spring of 1861 at the latest.
<br>Already these idiotic English believe that they will shortly inundate. France.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> A jackass of a calico printer—ONE OE THE SHARPEST—says that, with a 30% protective tariff in <i>France,</i> the business he could do there would be 15% more profitable than on any other market. The fool imagines that monopoly prices will continue to obtain in France, even if the monopoly is abolished. It has occurred to no one that the whole thing is a piece of sharp practice, the aim being to get at John Bull where he is notoriously vulnerable, and ultimately to fleece him good and proper.
<br>Who, actually, is the Mr Fischel who wrote the Duke of Coburg's<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> pamphlet for him<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> and now writes for <i>The Free Press}</i> Even from the excerpts from his pamphlet I could see that the Coburg chap has Urquhartite LEANINGS.
<br>Dronke is now in Liverpool and holds a very good agency for a Franco-Spanish copper mining company—£500 guaranteed and the possibility of earning up to £1,000, or so I'm told. Garnier-Pagès got it for him. He comes here quite often, but always steers clear of me, sending me his regards <i>post festum.</i>
<br>Lupus has had a bad bout of bronchitis but is better now though still very anxious about himself and not yet fully recovered. Once again he has so arranged inatters as to be in a chronic state of strife with his LANDLADY.
<br>I have a great deal to do at the office just now, hence the irregularity of my correspondence. Nor, for the time being, do I see that anything can be done about this excessive drudgery unless, as I hope, there is a crisis.
<br>Many regards to your wife and the YOLNG LADIES.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> <br>Your

ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 13 November 1868</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>I was really ashamed recently to send you a mere trifle of £5, but at that time I was really unable to squeeze out more; today a further five pounds follow enclosed; it was clear to me that just £5 would not help you out.</p>
<p><i>Amicus</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>Ernest Jones is now really catching it for becoming the obedient servant of Bright and Gladstone and identifying himself completely here with Bazley and Jacob Bright. This afternoon, two large posters blazed on all the walls, one black and one red, presenting a passage from <i>The People's Paper,</i> recently reprinted in the <i>Democrat</i> (WHAT IS THAT?), in which he rejects the cursing and baiting of aristocrats as a bourgeois dodge, proclaims LABOUR AGAINST CAPITAL, and slates the Manchester Liberals as the workers' worst enemies, but all in his <i>old</i> style, you know. This affair, so shortly before the election, can overthrow him.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Have you got the book: Ténot, <i>Paris en Décembre 1851,</i> and can you send me it? If not, I shall order it. Everything is well at home.</p>
<p>Many greetings.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

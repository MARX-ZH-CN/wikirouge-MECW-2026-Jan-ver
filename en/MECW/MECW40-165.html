ENGELS TO RUDOLF SCHRAMM</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>Manchester, 6 May 1858</p>
<p>To Mr R. Schramm in London</p>
<p>I have just received your note dated the 3rd. After the death of my friend, Conrad Schramm,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>I instructed Mr Harney to return to <i>us,</i> not you, the letters from Marx and myself found among his papers,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>since those letters were not intended for you. And this indeed was done.</p>
<p>I can see no reason whatever why I should discuss with you matters which concerned no one but myself and my late friend</p>
<p>and party comrade. While Conrad was still alive your own friends were surprised at the indifference you showed towards his financial circumstances.</p>
<p>In so far as I had anything to say about the disposal of Conrad's effects, I have said it to his only possible executor, Mr Harney.</p>
<p>As to my 'sense of justice', which has nothing whatever to do with the case, you may perhaps have occasion to become better acquainted with it some day in Germany.</p>
<p>I am, Sir, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>F. E.

In 1852 he went to the USA hoping to earn a living and improve his health. In the summer of 1857 he returned to London and, his condition having worsened, he was immediately placed in a hospital for German refugees. On 20 September he moved to Jersey where Engels too soon came for treatment. Schramm died on 15 January 1858.—158, 171, 312</span>

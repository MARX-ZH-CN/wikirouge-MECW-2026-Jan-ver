ENGELS TO LUDWIG SCHORLEMMER</p>
<p>IN DARMSTADT</p>
<p>London, 4 December 1890</p>
<p>Dear Mr Schorlemmer,</p>
<p>Not till today have I been able to get round to sending you my best thanks for your good wishes. My health is still pretty fair, if only my eyes permitted me to work at my desk; it's a wearisome and tedious business, but one has got to accept it. Again, smoking is something I can seldom permit myself, and your beautiful pipes stand on the chimney piece and seem to say as they look at me:</p>
<p>'What, old chap, have they done to thee?'</p>
<p>Warmest regards to your mother, your brothers and sisters and their families, and to all party comrades from</p>
<p>Your old friend</p>
<p>F. Engels
</p>

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN BRIGHTON</p>
<p>[London,] 31 May 1877</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>I hope that your eyes are better. Madame Lormier, whose eye trouble got worse day by day and became really serious, was sent by Madame Longuet SENIOR a little jar of ointment (said to cost no less than 30 francs), a very small quantity of which completely cured her—<i>mirabile dictu<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></i>—within a few days. There is no disputing that FACT. The ointment enjoys considerable repute in France and, by smelling, observing it, etc., you will doubtless discover what the main ingredient is.</p>
<p>So closely do your views on the STATE IN TURKEY agree with my own that I had said literally almost the same thing to Wroblewski.</p>
<p>But the crisis is not far off. Damad Mahmud and Co. who are under the direct influence of Russia, are apparently much inclined to conclude peace with the Russians, one of the terms being, of course (as indeed recommended by <i>The Times,</i> in the same number in which that paper raps Mac-Mahon over the knuckles for his anti-constitutionalism<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>), <i>the abolition of the constitution.</i> Nothing could be more opportune for the Tsar<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>; hitherto all that has taken place has been in the nature of a preliminary military parade; Russian victories in Asia Minor have been overrated and overstated for various reasons (apart from BLOODY IGNORANCE) by the various parties; financial constraint as such is as yet in its infancy; the Caucasian malady is as yet no more than sporadic; for the present the Tsar might get off with a <i>succès d'estime</i> and without constitutional constraint, and might in his turn have an important part to play in the occidental crisis, etc., etc. Midhat Pasha, I AM TOLD, DOES EVERYTHING FROM HERE TO PUSH THE MOVEMENT AT CONSTANTINOPLE ON WHICH, IN FACT, THE FATE OF TURKEY (AND THE IMMEDIATE PROSPECTS OF RUSSIAN 'DEVELOPMENT') DEPEND.</p>
<p>In France we are beginning to see what I have long in vain been telling Lissagaray (who is now again taking too rosy a view), namely that the really industrial and commercial bourgeoisie is becoming republican, as indeed events EVEN SINCE THIERS' RÉGIME have clearly shown, and that the <i>hommes de combat<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></i> do not represent a particular class, but only the <i>beaux restes<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></i> of the former parties' PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS. The workers (in Paris) have taken for their watchword <i>que c'est cette fois l'affaire de Messieurs les bourgeois<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>.</i> Hence they are holding back.</p>
<p>From the enclosed cutting from the <i>Marseillaise</i> you will see how Mac-Mahon is being treated by the radical journals. The sagacious <i>République Française</i> tells him that the question can be decided only by his resignation; Emile de Girardin threatens him with IMPEACHMENT and, of all the papers, the <i>Siècle,</i> the <i>épicier<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></i> paper <i>par excellence,</i> treats him with the greatest ruthlessness.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Bonapartists are insistent. Too late in the day to draw the sword (apart from the fact that it's not in Brogue's LINE). But (after the Chamber has been further prorogued) there might be an attempt to institute an <i>état de siège<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup></i>—illegal, it is true, but covered by the ministers' <i>responsabilité légale<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup></i> and Mac-Mahon's <i>irresponsabilité constitutionelle<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>.</i> Such a course, which is being urged by the Bonapartists at least, might yet give rise to violent clashes. It's a possibility, if an unlikely one.</p>
<p>Collet, as in duty bound, has informed me of Urquhart's death. My own constitution, while not exceptionally flourishing, is pretty fair compared with what it usually is about this time of year. My wife is getting better.</p>
<p>The weaning of the little chap<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup>(the Irishwoman is still with us in the meantime) has gone smoothly, but he evinces a dangerous passion for crawling up the stairs instead of round the drawing-room.</p>
<p>Warmest regards from one family to the other.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 29 November 1858</p>
<p>DEAR Frederick,</p>
<p>ARTICLE received.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> VERY GOOD. <i>Quoad</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Bonaparte, I have lately dealt with two separate points—the SHAM PROVOCATION of England in the Portuguese affair<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> and how the fellow is GENERALLY avenging Waterloo 2 7 only in so far as he can do so by SHAM DEMONSTRATIONS within the 'limits of the English alliance' and hence, IN FACT, with the permission of the English government, although he is, in reality, England's underling. Secondly, his edict <i>re</i> the CORN- GRANARIES,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> by which this 'socialist' proposes to remedy the ruinously LOW PRICES OF CORN—dangerously low, in view of the grumbles of the PEASANTRY—by creating an artificial demand at the BAKERS expense.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>GENERALLY, A VERY DANGEROUS EXPERIMENT THIS, TO RAISE THE PRICE OF CORN THROUGH GOVERNMENT UKASES. Increasing the cost of bread will do more harm to his popularity in the towns than it can do good in the country.</p>
<p>I have not written about the GENERAL RISING of the bourgeoisie in Europe but did, of course, allude to it in what I wrote about Prussia. I have dealt with the Russian peasant movement ABOUT twice in 6 months,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> the second time simply to show that on the first occasion my diagnosis was correct.</p>
<p>As regards the reform movement in England, all I have discussed latterly is Bright's meeting in Birmingham,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> the gist of the article being THAT HIS PROGRAMME IS A REDUCTION OF THE PEOPLES CHARTER TO THE MIDDLE CLASS STANDARD.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> Earlier on, ABOUT 8-12 WEEKS ago (I think Parliament was actually still sitting), a piece to the effect that WHIGGISM MUST DISSOLVE AND COALESCE WITH TORYISM INTO THE PARTY OF <i>THE</i> ARISTOCRACY.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> T h a t is all.</p>
<p>My wife is copying the manuscript<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> and it's hardly likely to go off before the end of this month. T h e reasons for the delay: long intervals of physical indisposition which, with the cold weather, has now come to an end. T o o much domestic and financial TROUBLE. Finally, the first section is now longer because the two initial chapters, of which the <i>first, The Commodity,</i> did not appear at all in the rough draft while the <i>second, Money, or Simple Circulation,</i> was only sketched in the briefest outline, have been written at greater length than I originally planned.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>Mr Edgar Bauer is now the real, and Mr Lout and Weitlingian Scherzer the nominal, editor of the London <i>Neue Zeit.</i> Mr Edgar, of course, has a great deal to say on the subject of Mr Edgar and his lectures to the working men,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> for he himself writes about everything concerning Mr Edgar. This CLOWN deems it necessary to take a revolutionary TURN. He presided at the Robert Blum ceremony. In an essay in the last issue the CLOWN makes the discovery that 'imperialism' has now been introduced into Prussia</p>
<p>in constitutional form.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> This same issue is not uninteresting by reason of an article from Struve's <i>Sociale Republik</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13" id="cite_ref-13">[13]</a></sup> which was, however, written over here by a certain Feibel and in which Freiligrath, on the occasion of the publication of his poems in America, had himself extolled AS THE TRUE HERO OF THE PROLETARIAN PARTY.

The vessel had on board a number of  East-African Negroes who were to be shipped, allegedly as free emigrants, to  the French island of Réunion.  The Franco-Portuguese talks continued for almost a year but brought no  results. On 13 October 1858 Napoleon III, whom Marx calls here Quasimodo  (a character from Victor Hugo's<i> Notre-Dame de Paris),</i> sent a special Note to the  Portuguese Government demanding the return of the confiscated vessel and  the release of its captain. The demand was backed by the despatch of two  French warships to the Portuguese capital. Portugal was compelled to yield.  Marx touches on the subject in his article 'The French Slave Trade'  published in the<i> New-York Daily Tribune</i> on 1 December 1858 with considerable  editorial changes (see present edition, Vol. 16, pp. 621-23).—351, 357</span>

The other demands  were either omitted altogether or drastically moderated. Thus Bright suggested  that suffrage should be granted only to persons paying property tax; in place of  equal constituencies he suggested fairer representation for the existing  constituencies.—358</span>

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Ventnor,] 20 November 1882</p>
<p>DEAR FRED,</p>
<p>By the end of this week (i. e. next Monday, <i>27 November)</i> I shall be on my uppers. As I am supposed to advise you a week beforehand, I am now doing so. Before leaving London I paid ABOUT £ 5 to the PARLIAMENTARY BOOKSELLER St. King and ABOUT <i>£2</i> to Kolkmann (bookseller), but also spent £ 3 on sundry items.</p>
<p>Tussy and Johnny left me at ABOUT 3 O'CLOCK today in passable weather.</p>
<p>I am perturbed over the news from Paris; it's unpardonable that Lafargue, Guesde, etc., should permit themselves to be caught up in legal proceedings 4 4 0; it could have been foreseen; the whole thing was simply occasioned by 'anxiety' over competition from the 'anarchists'! Puerile!</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.
</p>

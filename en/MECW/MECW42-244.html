<p><i>To Engels in Manchester</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 24 August 1867</b></p>
<p><b>Dear Fred</b>,</p>
<p>I have received no further corrected proofs [of the first volume of <i>Capital</i>] since the 2 last that I sent you. I am exceedingly vexed with Meissner. He has obviously <i>held back</i> what Wigand has sent him in order to send <i>everything at once</i> — and save 4d. postage!</p>
<p>The same Meissner wrote me last week that he is printing a certain part of my preface specially (and he has indeed made the <i>right choice</i>) to send to the German newspapers. I wrote asking him to send me copies of it at once. I reckoned that you would translate the thing into <i>English</i> (I shall then give it to <i>The Bee-Hive,</i> which is taken by Mill, Beesly, Harrison, etc.), and Lafargue with Laura's help into French for the <i>Courrier français</i>, finally I wanted to send <b>one copy</b> to my correspondent in America. To save the 4d., Meissner has sent <i>nothing</i>. He will be sending it all together. But a <i>great deal of time</i> is lost in the process!</p>
<p>The best points in my book are: 1. (this is fundamental to all understanding of the <b>facts</b>) the <i>two-fold character of labour</i> according to whether it is expressed in use-value or exchange-value, which is brought out in the very <i>First</i> Chapter; 2. the treatment of <i>surplus-value regardless of its particular</i> forms as profit, interest, ground rent, etc. This will be made clear in the second volume especially. The treatment of the particular forms in classical political economy, where they are for ever being jumbled up together with the general form, is an <i>olla potrida.</i></p>
<p>Please <i>enter</i> your <i>desiderata,</i> critical remarks, <b>queries</b>, etc., on the corrected proofs. This is very important for me, as I am reckoning on a 2nd edition sooner or later. As regards <b>Chapter IV</b>, it was a hard job finding <i>things themselves</i> i.e., their <i>interconnection</i>. But with that once behind me, along came one <b>Blue Book</b> after another just as I was composing the final <i>version</i> and I was delighted to find my theoretical conclusions fully confirmed by the <b>facts</b>. Finally, it was written to the accompaniment of <b>carbuncles</b> and daily dunning by creditors!</p>
<p>For the conclusion to the 2nd book (<i>Process of Circulation</i>), which I am writing <i>now</i>, I am again obliged to seek your advice on one point, as I did many years ago.</p>
<p>Fixed capital only has to be replaced <i>in natura</i> after, say, 10 years. In the meantime, its value returns partially and <i>gradatim</i>, as the goods that it has produced are sold. This <b>progressive return</b> of the fixed capital is only required for its replacement (aside from <b>repairs</b> and the like) when it becomes defunct in its material form, e.g., as a machine. <i>Prior to that</i>, however, these <b>successive returns</b> are in the capitalist's possession.</p>
<p>Many years ago I wrote to you that it seemed to me that in this manner an <i>accumulation fund</i> was being built up, since <i>in the intervening period</i> the capitalist was of course <i>using</i> the returned money, before replacing the <i>capital fixe</i> with it. You disagreed with this <b>somewhat superficially</b> in a letter. I later found that MacCulloch describes this <b>sinking fund</b> as an accumulation fund. Being convinced that no idea of MacCulloch's could ever be right, I let the matter drop. His <i>apologetic</i> purpose here has already been refuted by the Malthusians, but <i>they, too, admit the</i> <b>fact</b><i>.</i></p>
<p>Now, as a manufacturer, you must know what you do with the <b>returns</b> on <i>capital fixe before</i> the time it has to be replaced in natura. And you must answer this point for me (without theorising, <i>in purely practical terms</i>).</p>
<p><i>Salut</i>.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.</p>
<p>(<i>Salut</i> to <b>Mrs</b> Lizzy!)</p>
<p>The children are still at Royan, near Bordeaux.

ENGELS TO PYOTR LAVROV</p>
<p>IN PARIS</p>
<p>London, 21 May 1893</p>
<p>My dear Lavrov,</p>
<p>The day before yesterday I sent you by post a book by N. F. Danielson: <i>Ocherki Nashego Poreformennogo Khozyaistva.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>He also informed me that the parents of our friend H. Lopatin have had news of him, and that he is well. 209</p>
<p>You promised to send me a copy of the brochure in which you were going to publish a letter of Lopatin in which I am mentioned—I still have not received it. 97 As I have been told that it has appeared, the packet must have gone astray in the post. Could you send me another copy?</p>
<p>I hope you are keeping well—just as I am, with no reason to complain.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>F. Engels

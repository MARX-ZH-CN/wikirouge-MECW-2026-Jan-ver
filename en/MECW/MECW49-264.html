ENGELS TO LUDWIG KUGELMANN</p>
<p>IN AHLBECK</p>
<p>Ryde, 5 September 1892</p>
<p>Dear Kugelmann,</p>
<p>There will be no trip to Germany for me this year. I have gone lame and must take it easy for the next fortnight at least before I can so much as begin to move about again. Meanwhile I shall be return- ing to London tomorrow.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> However I still intend to make another tour of inspection of my native land next year, but whether I shall also manage to take in Hanover is impossible to say so far in advance, the more so as I have seen this summer how quickly all such plans can come to nothing, for this year I have been cheated out of a long and delightful trip and who can tell whether we shall still be alive next year. But you may rest assured that I shall leave the 'Pomeranian grandees'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> to others. The last of them I saw was an alleged Baron Grumbkow, a seedy looking individual who in the role of professional beggar tried to touch me for a loan some six months ago but was thrown out. <i>Cela me suffit!</i> With many regards.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. Engels</p>
<p>Please let Singer have the enclosed.

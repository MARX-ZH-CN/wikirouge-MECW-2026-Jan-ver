<p>MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 9 March 1854
28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>I have not written for a long time because I have had a great deal of TROUBLE at home which has even prevented me from reading the papers properly, so that I don't know whether anything of yours has yet appeared in <i>The Daily News</i> or how the whole thing is going.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>As yet I have got nothing, i.e. not a single farthing, out of my 'Palmerston', nor does there seem to be any prospect of my doing so. Mr Trübner has himself told me that, <i>quant a lui</i>,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> it is a PRINCIPLE of his never to pay for the stuff he publishes. Moreover, the thing's out of date <i>au moment</i>.</p>
<p>On Tuesday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> I shall send the last of the sample articles to the Cape.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> (So you must let me have <i>something</i> for the <i>Tribune</i>, PERHAPS THE GREEK REVOLUTION?) Tuesday will be the last day of regular sailings to the Cape, since the company has fallen out with the government over charges.</p>
<p>I am faced with the repulsive prospect of enduring throughout the spring and summer the same chronic pressure as in previous years, since it is not possible for me to work off past debts with the earnings from the <i>Tribune</i> alone. From time to time I'm driven wild by the thought that I shall never get out of this mire.</p>
<p>You have not returned Lassalle's letter as you indicated you had in your last.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> I <i>don't need it</i> but only want to be sure that it hasn't gone astray in the post or fallen into the wrong hands.</p>
<p>I have received an invitation from the LABOUR PARLIAMENT<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> to sit as HONORARY DELEGATE in Manchester (Nadaud and Louis Blanc likewise). I wrote today, thanking them for it, and made a few remarks which, according to how they are construed, could be either very extreme or very moderate.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> I sent Jones your office address today.</p>
<p>The great Ruge intends to found a university (a free one) in America and, as Heinzen announces, 150 dollars has already been collected for this noble purpose.</p>
<p>The great Franz Sigel has become Dulon's son-in-law. What else has been happening among that crew you will discover from a parcel which will descend on you in a few days' time.</p>
<p>In yesterday's <i>Advertiser</i> there was a <i>military</i> (?) article by Urquhart<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> in which he maintains that the Turks should have sent their main army to the Dobrudja and assaulted the Russians from there. Cites General Valentini. I shall make sure to send you the issue.</p>
<p>I have written to Lassalle<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> and await further communications from him.</p>
<p>Tzschirner came to see me, didn't find me in, is going to America on a financial matter with his 80-year-old mother and will then settle over here. Claims he already knows you, or so Imandt says.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

<li id="cite_note-6"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-6">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">In 1853, with the growth of a massive strike movement of the British proletariat, a group of Chartists headed by Ernest Jones proposed to create a broad workers' organisation, The Mass Movement, which was to unite trade unions and unorganised workers with the primary aim of coordinating strikes in the various districts of the country. The organisation was to be headed by a regularly convened Labour Parliament consisting of delegates elected at meetings of both unorganised workers and of the trade unions associated with The Mass Movement. The Labour Parliament assembled in Manchester on 6 March 1854 and was in session till 18 March 1854. It discussed and adopted the programme of The Mass Movement and set up an Executive of five members. Marx, elected honorary delegate to the Parliament, sent a letter to it (see present edition, Vol. 13), in which he formulated the primary task of the British labour movement—the necessity to create an independent proletarian mass political party. Marx regarded the convocation of the Labour Parliament as an effort to free the labour movement in Britain from narrow trade union limitations. The attempt to found The Mass Movement failed because the majority of the trade union leaders did not approve of associating the trade unions with the political struggle and did not support the idea of creating a single mass workers' organisation. By the summer of 1854 the strike movement had abated and this also cut short the participation of broad masses of workers in the movement. After March 1854 the Labour Parliament never met again. Besides the 'Letter to the Labour Parliament', Marx wrote two more articles on the activity of the Labour Parliament: 'Opening of the Labour Parliament.— English War Budget' and 'The Labor Parliament' (see present edition, Vol. 13)</span>

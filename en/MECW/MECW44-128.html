MARX TO MONCURE DANIEL CONWAY<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Draft] [London, 29 August 1871]</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>On my return from Brighton<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>I found your note d.d. August 24. The next meeting of the General Council takes place to-day, but consequent upon a resolution passed on Tuesday last,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>there will during the continuance of the courts-martial in France<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>no visitors be any longer admissible. This strict measure had been rendered necessary by the intrusion of French police agents.</p>
<p>I have the honour to inclose a subscription list for the French refugees. Their numbers (they are now 80-90) [are] increasing daily (there are now about 80 [in] number)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>while our funds are quite exhausted. Their case is truly deplorable. The best thing would be, if possible, to form a separate committee charged to find employment for those men whose great majority consists of skilled workmen and artists.</p>
<p>I have the honour, Sir, to be</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

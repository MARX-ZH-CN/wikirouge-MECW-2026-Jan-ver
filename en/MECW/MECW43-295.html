ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 22 February 1870</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>If Imandt had gone immediately to a SOLICITOR, just like the North German consul, he would most probably have learned that a debt contracted abroad is not recoverable by legal action in Scotland—or should Scotland be an exception to all other countries? On superannuation, the <i>Code Civil</i> states, Article 2262, that <i>all plaints</i> are superannuated after 30 years; Article 2265: who acquires something in <i>good faith</i>—superannuation in 10, respectively 20 years<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>; Article 2271: the plaint of masters and teachers of sciences and arts regarding instruction given <i>monthly,</i> superannuates in <i>6 months.</i> Since this last article does not correspond to the case, the plaint has obviously been filed simply in order to <i>interrupt</i> the superannuation in Rhenish Prussia, or also to see if Imandt can be browbeaten by fear of showing himself up, and will thus pay. His counter-bills are possibly made out on word of honour, in which case he could be shown up badly, in his position. Under Article 2244 a <i>court summons</i> interrupts the superannuation.</p>
<p>Katkov's elucidations about Bakunin are not worth much.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>He does not say to <i>whom</i> the repentant letters were supposedly sent. Borrowing money is such a normal Russian means of sustenance that no Russian should reproach another on the subject. And that Bakunin should have used the 6,000 roubles lent him in order to flee, instead of paying the <i>otkupschtschik,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>is really ludicrous. And that somebody banished to Siberia should once turn to Katkov, although otherwise he has no time for him—one can't make much of that either. It will annoy Bakunin, but I can't see that Gaudissart<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>will dig much capital out of it.</p>
<p>You can tell Gaudissart concerning his plan regarding Flerovsky that, if an English publisher is interested, he will find himself a translator who will translate <i>AT THE MARKET RATE,</i> which differs considerably from what Gaudissart calls 'paying well', and who will finish it in 2-3 months, and not take a whole year. Gaudissart should not think that he is the only person who knows Russian. There will still be time to return to the other points when he has really found a publisher. Incidentally, it won't hurt at all if Gaudissart makes enquiries amongst the London PUBLISHERS. If he should find somebody, which I hardly believe, this contact could be utilised at a later date. You can easily refuse the preface, saying it would be arrogant of you to wish to introduce a foreign book to English literature, before you yourself had been <i>introduced</i> to it by an English edition of your own book.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Apropos, why don't you put Eccarius on to tackling the foul prison deeds in <i>Volksstaat?</i></p>
<p>Sybel, of course, does mention the second partitioning of Poland behind Austria's back,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>but, at the same time, he tries to prove once again that Prussia was entitled to do this, on account of some sort of previous Austrian treachery. His entire reasoning is this: when Prussia allies itself with Russia <i>against</i> Austria, this is in order, but if Austria attempts to ally itself with Russia against Prussia, this is treachery. The Pan-Germans and Austrians—Arneth, Vivenot and consorts—claim the opposite; so the two schools of history-mutilators today behave just as stupidly with regard to Russia as the two German powers did then.</p>
<p>I still haven't got hold of the damned Irish laws.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>I have discovered Giraldus Cambrensis<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>; it can be had from Bohn, translated, for 5s. At the moment I'm going through Wakefield,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>who has a lot of good things on climate, soil, etc., with all sorts of omnium-gatherum in between. The fellow considers himself very learned, and is partial to quoting German, Dutch, Danish, etc., trash.</p>
<p>Yesterday I laughed more than I have for ages when I read Moses' Paris letter in <i>Volksstaat</i> about Flourens<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>and the other new 'forces' that are replacing and supplanting old Blanqui, etc. The old blockhead never changes. Wilhelm<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup>ditto: his latest reports on <i>19 February</i> are: Hanover, <i>13 January,</i> Lörrach, 23 January, Munich, 25 January, Ernstthal, 17 January!</p>
<p>Incidentally, things are moving quickly in France. Jules Favre could do nothing better than to declare himself so vehemently against all violence, and in favour of peaceful progress, though limited.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>My move to London late in summer has now been decided. Lizzie has told me that she would like to leave Manchester, the sooner the better; she has had some rows with relations, and she is fed up with the whole business here. We shall get rid of our house in September, so everything must be arranged between July and September.</p>
<p>Best greetings.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

The Code continued to operate in the Rhine Province after its annexation by Prussia. Article 2265 quoted by Engels reads in full: 'Those who acquire real estate in good faith (bona fides) through honest work and on legal grounds, are acquiring property by virtue of the expiry of the ten years' statute of limitations if the owner is residing on the territory under the jurisdiction of the court of appeal in which the property is located, and twenty years limitations, if he is residing outside this territory.'</span>

Reporter Peter Fox, a member of the British labour movement, was to help him find a publisher. However, due to the latter's death in 1869 nothing was settled. The English translation of Volume One of <i>Capital</i> edited by Engels appeared after Marx's death, in January 1887. The translation was done by Samuel Moore and Edward Aveling between mid-1883 and March 1886; Eleanor Marx-Aveling assisted in preparing the translation for the press.</span>

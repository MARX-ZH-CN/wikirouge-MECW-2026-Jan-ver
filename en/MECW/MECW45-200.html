MARX TO WILHELM BRACKE</p>
<p>IN BRUNSWICK</p>
<p>[London,] 23 October 1877</p>
<p>Dear Bracke,</p>
<p>Your news is bad but was readily predictable. I have already suggested on a number of- occasions that you should kick out the gracious Isolde.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>However much corrected, her product remains an abortion.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>Add to that the waste of time, waste of money, etc. There can be no legal objection to that person's being 'kicked out' since she does not, and is unable to, perform what<br>
she contractually undertook to do. <i>Bios</i> had at one time proffered his services (unfortunately not until after Isolde).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The review, <i>Zukunft,</i> is by no means satisfactory, its main endeavour being to substitute ideological catch-phrases such as 'justice', etc., for materialist knowledge. Its programme<br>
is wretched! Promises, what's more, to peddle phantasms of the future structure of society. This, the first result of a bourgeois<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>buying his way into the party, is not a happy one—as might have been predicted.</p>
<p>The <i>Vorwärts,</i> too, is publishing a mass of immature, stereotyped <i>essays</i> by aspiring and presumptuous striplings.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>I shouldn't have thought the proletariat's money was intended to provide a dumping-ground for such exercises.</p>
<p>I trust your health is improving. I myself have been suffering from influenza for several weeks,— most disruptive of work.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>K. M.

<li id="cite_note-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-3">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Considering it very important to familiarise workers with the true history of the Paris Commune, Marx became actively involved in the commissioning of a German translation of a book written by one of its members, Prosper Olivier Lissagaray, <i>Histoire de la Commune de 1871.</i> He requested Wilhelm Bracke, and Engels asked Wilhelm Bios to find somebody to do the job. The sample translation done by Julius Grunzig failed to satisfy Marx, as did that by Isolde Kurz. Although Marx was already overburdened with work, he had to spend a great deal of time and effort editing the translation. In the autumn of 1877, on Marx's and Engels' proposal, Wilhelm Bios was recruited as another editor. Lissagaray's book appeared in German in Brunswick late in 1877.— 155, 172, 189, "l 96,' 222, 230, 262, 266, 285 19.) The general socialist congress held in Gotha from 19 to 23 August 1876 decided, at its meeting of 23 August, to publish a single organ of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany,<i> Vorwärts,</i> that was lo replace<i> Der Volksstaat</i> and<i> Der  Neue Social-Demokrat.</i> The congress elected Wilhelm Liebknecht and Wilhelm Hasenclever editors of the new paper, which was to appear from 1 October.</span>

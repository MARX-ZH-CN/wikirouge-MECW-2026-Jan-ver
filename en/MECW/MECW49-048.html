ENGELS TO WILHELM LIEBKNECHT</p>
<p>IN BERLIN</p>
<p>London, 8 December 1890</p>
<p>Dear Liebknecht,</p>
<p>There is more trouble in store for Brentano than he expects—just you wait and see! Thanks for the note about Gladstone, but I should point out that / <i>require the issues of the 'Deutsches Wochenblatt<b> containing the text of what Brentano and Gladstone actually said</b></i><b>—the short note would only mislead me, and I mustn't allow that to happen. If you haven't got time to obtain them for me, ask Fischer who will certainly do so at once.</b></p>
<p>Leave Brentano to me. You won't be disappointed. But without this <i>new</i> material I can't finish the thing off<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F.E.</p>
<p>Since Gladstone's letters were dated 22 and 28 November, there can be no doubt about <i>which</i> issues of the <i>Wochenblatt</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>the stuff is in.

On 4 Decem ber this journal carried a note containing two passages from Gladstone's letters to Brentano of 22 and 28 November 1890 in which Gladstone asserted that Brentano was right.<br>Engels replied in a brief article, 'In the Case of Brentano Versus Marx'<i> (Die  Neue Zeit,</i> 9. Jg., 1890/91, 1. Bd., Nr. 13) and, at greater length, in a pamphlet of the same title, published in April 1891, which contained a large number of docu ments, including the above-mentioned article (see present edition, Vol. 27).</span>

MARX TO HERMANN JUNG</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 13 August [1869]</p>
<p>Dear Jung,</p>
<p>Your letter just received (2 o'clock). Go at all events.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> The sending of Applegarth by his own Union will show to the continentals that the English workmen are not so indifferent in regard to the International as their ill-wishers say. It is only a pity that Applegarth does not even take part at our present discussions, so as to be able to represent our views.</p>
<p>If care be not taken, the asses of Denmark street may work mischief. A letter ought also to be written to our Pole<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> —I have not his address.</p>
<p>Yours truly</p>
<p>K. M.

On 17 August, Jung informed the General Council that the Society would probably send a representative to the Congress. This was the Society's General Secretary Robert Applegarth, who, however, carried only a General Council member's mandate.</span>

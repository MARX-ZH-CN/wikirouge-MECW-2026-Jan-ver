<p><i>Hungary.</i> A correspondent writes to the Augsburg <i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i> on March 21 from Pest:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It appears certain that <i>Kaschau and a few other districts in northern Hungary have been re-occupied by the Hungarians</i>. At least, yesterday's post bound for Kaschau did not get as far as Gyöngyös and has returned here."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gyöngyös is in the rear of Schlick's position at Erlau, and about eleven miles from Pest.

ENGELS TO PASQUALE MARTIGNETTI</p>
<p>IN BENEVENTO</p>
<p>London, 20 July 1889</p>
<p>My dear friend Martignetti,</p>
<p>All I can say in reply to your letter of the 14th inst. is that my funds are only limited and, furthermore, that there are calls on them from a great many quarters. Hence, if your Buenos Aires plan goes ahead, I cannot possibly assume the responsibility of guaranteeing your livelihood until such time as you are able to lay the foundations of a new livelihood yourself. I will tell you quite candidly what more I can do. I can place another five pounds sterling at your disposal and, should something <i>very important</i> be at stake, shall try and send you another five, i.e. <i>ten</i> pounds <i>in all.</i> That, however, would in fact exhaust my funds for a long time to come and render it impossible for me to do anything further for you.</p>
<p>I hope you will be justly treated by the court of appeal and remain</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>F. Engels

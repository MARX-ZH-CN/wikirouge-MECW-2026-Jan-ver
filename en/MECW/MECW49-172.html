ENGELS TO HERMANN ENGELS</p>
<p>IN BARMEN</p>
<p>London, 29 January 1892</p>
<p>Dear Hermann,</p>
<p>It is often said of women that what they really have to say never goes into the letter but into the postscript. But we old buffers are in even worse case—for hardly was yesterday's letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>in the post when I remembered the most important thing of all. Namely that, in strange contrast to the surplus of cash on the London money market, I am suffering from a slight shortage of that article and, since I can only expect small dividends up till 1 March, I should be grateful if, some time soon, you could send me some £30 of the balance you hold on my behalf. Then I shall make out quite well; between March and June money will again be coming in at a brisk pace.</p>
<p>Love from</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>Friedrich

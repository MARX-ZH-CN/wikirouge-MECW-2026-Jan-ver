ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE</p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>London, 21 March 1891</p>
<p>Dear Sorge,</p>
<p>Have shown your letter re Miss Anna<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>to our friends and promptly complied with your instructions. Enclosed you will find a brief note to the same in which she is hauled over the coals and notified that the letters she has written hitherto, with their repeated requests for money, have fallen on stony ground.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>I have been asked to tell you that people in this country are of the opinion that enough has now been done for her both over here and out there, that she must now arrange for her own advancement and that this could best be achieved out in the country, doing agricultural work such as she is used to. To this I replied that that sort of thing would be possible only in a district where she could get along without any English, but that since such districts did exist out there, the thing was not impossible. At all events, New York and sea-ports generally would not appear to be at all the right terrain for a female of her ilk and if she is to achieve anything, she must go so far away as to make it very difficult for her to come back again.</p>
<p>In the meantime you will also have had my letter<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>with a money order for ten pounds and will, under the circumstances, have been able to put it to good use. Between ourselves, I believe that, should need arise, I could again raise a like amount, but that would probably be that. I have also been asked to request you people to be <i>strict</i> in regard to money matters so that the person concerned may finally realise that this idling can't go on for ever.</p>
<p>Besides the Vienna <i>Arbeiter-Zeitung</i> I am also sending you today a <i>Volks-Tribüne</i> and <i>Figaro</i> (Paris MEETING), and an Italian translation of the <i>Manifesto</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>The <i>People's Press</i> and <i>Commonweal</i> have both gone phut.</p>
<p>I do not yet know whether or not I shall reply to the <i>Vorwärts</i> article,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>but I am beginning to incline towards your view.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>There are a few points I really <i>ought to</i> touch on; however, it might be possible to do so in some other way.</p>
<p>I am having to arrange for new editions and/or new introductions to 1. <i>The Civil War in France,</i> 2. Marx's <i>Wage Labour and Capital</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>and 3. <i>Entwicklung des Sozialismus</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>; the German party is to bring them out in editions of 10,000 copies.</p>
<p>My reply to Brentano<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>will be published by Meissner in about 8 or 10 days' time. You shall have it straight away.</p>
<p>Then I have a new edition of <i>The Origin of the Family, etc.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>to see to (5,000 sold!), after which, however, I shall apply myself inexorably and unremittingly to Volume III.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Sam Moore arrived in Liverpool the day before yesterday and will probably be here in about a week's time. At Christmas he caught some horrible disease from which, however, he has completely recovered.</p>
<p>I trust your wife<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup>is her old self once more. Warmest regards to her and to you.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

On 4 December this journal carried a note containing two passages from Gladstone's letters to Brentano of 22 and 28 November 1890 in which Gladstone asserted that Brentano was right. Engels replied in a brief article, 'In the Case of Brentano Versus Marx' (<i>Die Neue Zeit,</i> 9. Jg., 1890/91, 1. Bd., Nr. 13) and, at greater length, in a pamphlet of the same title, published in April 1891, which contained a large number of documents, including the above-mentioned article (see present edition, Vol. 27).</span>

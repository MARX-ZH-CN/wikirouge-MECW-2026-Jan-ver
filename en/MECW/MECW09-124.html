<blockquote>
<p>The report which Engels cites from the liberal <i>Düsseldorfer Zeitung</i> and supplements with a call to the Cologne troops to join the popular movement, describes the initial stage of the Elberfeld uprising.</p>
<p>The <i>Elberfeld </i>uprising of workers and petty bourgeois broke out on May 8, 1849 and served as a signal for armed struggle in a number of cities in the Rhine Province (Düsseldorf, Iserlohn, Solingen and others) in defence of the imperial Constitution. The immediate occasion for the uprising was the attempts by the Prussian Government to use troops to suppress the revolutionary movement on the Rhine, to destroy democratic organisations and the press, and to disarm the army reserve troops it had itself called up which disobeyed its orders and supported the demand for the imperial Constitution. Engels played an active part in the uprising, having arrived in Elberfeld on May 11 together with a workers' detachment from Solingen (later legal proceedings were instituted against him for this). Engels' efforts to secure the disbandment of the bourgeois civic militia, the imposition of a war tax on the bourgeoisie, extensive armament of the workers in order to form the core of the Rhenish revolutionary army and to unite local uprisings, met with opposition from the Committee of Public Safety which was dominated by the representatives of the local bourgeoisie. Under pressure from bourgeois circles, Engels was deported from the city on the morning of May 15. As a result of secret negotiations between a deputation from the city bourgeoisie and the Government and of the capitulatory stand taken by the Committee of Public Safety, workers' detachments including those which came to their support from other places (the Berg Country, etc.) were forced out of the city on the night of May 16 (some managed to break through to the south, to the insurgent Palatinate) and the previous order was restored in Elberfeld. The defeat of the Elberfeld uprising led to the triumph of reaction throughout Rhenish Prussia.</p>
<p>The <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> and <i>Neue Kölnische Zeitung </i>devoted several articles to the events in <a class="mw-redirect" eywords:elberfeld"="" href="KeywordsElberfeld.html">Elberfeld</a>.

<blockquote>
<p><em>Elberfeld</em>, May 8. After several posters appealing to the people to support the army reserve in their refusal of military duty, as well as a proclamation by the army reserve against the King and Government, had been torn down by the police, the latter were attacked and <em>forced to fasten the posters to the offices and doors</em> while the people watched them. Towards the evening, as the crowds grew larger and larger, the rumour spread that troops were on their way. And so the <em>army reserve took up arms</em> and forced the burgomaster to accompany them to the railway station to try and persuade the regular troops to turn back. However, when they were passing the officers' mess von Carnap took refuge in it and the people then demolished the building. Whilst the army reserve marched to the station to prevent the troops from entering the town, the armed forces appeared on the scene causing confusion among the crowd and lashing out at them to such an extent that a number of casualties had to be carried away.

<blockquote>
<p>"But the crowd gathered again and went to the town hall where the civic militia had in the meantime been mounted to defend the building. It contains a great deal of ammunition, and the demand was raised that this should be handed over. After this demand had been refused, an attempt was made to force an entry, but this was unsuccessful. A hail of stones had in the meantime smashed several window-panes. At 8 o'clock this morning, the army reserve, <em>fully armed</em>, have taken up positions near Böttcher on Engelnberg <em>where they await the arrival of the military</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Many proletarians armed with weapons have joined them, as well as army reserve units from other parts. The civic militia are equally active, but will not attack the army reserve and only control the crowd. If the military arrive and attack the army reserve, then alas! They will have to come in large numbers if they are to achieve anything." D.Z.

<p>(This morning artillery left Cologne at an early hour bound for Elberfeld, in order to riddle with grape-shot the honest workers of the Berg Country who are not willing to be used unlawfully as tools by a traitorous camarilla. We trust that the artillery will <em>do its duty</em>.)

MARX TO ENGELS
<br>IN MANCHESTER
<br>[London,] 17 April 1860
<br>Dear Engels,
<br>I trust that your indisposition isn't serious. Also that you are taking care of yourself and not over-working.
<br>I have sent Lommel <i>the 150 francs</i> today.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> (What you don't manage to scrape together in Manchester will be collected here.) For the following reasons:
<br>1. If he is to retrieve the books<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> from the bookbinders', he has. got to pay 50 frs. That leaves him 100 frs. To haggle over that would be <i>exceedingly impolitic</i> and would not command any respect for our party.
<br>2. The main thing is that the so-called advance be sent to the chap quickly and <i>unconditionally.</i> In that way, he'll be beholden to us. The other half he shall have BY AND BY and thus will remain
<br><i>ENGAGED</i> t O U S. 3. As soon as he has the money, he will leave for Savoy whence he will send back reports.
<br>4. From Petsch's note enclosed herewith (I gave him the copy Siebel brought back with him) you will see that he believes that he can make a profit on what is, in fact, an interesting pamphlet.
<br>5. L. is a decent chap. Otherwise he'd sell himself. From the papers Becker has sent me, I see that Lommel was a leading light
<br>in the old Republican Party. Also a friend of Heinzen's. What a clamour there'll be from the latter over this defection!
<br>I am in two minds about Siebel's work for the <i>Strassburger Zeitung?</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <br>Your
<br>K. M.

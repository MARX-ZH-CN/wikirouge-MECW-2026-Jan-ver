ENGELS TO CHARLES FITZGERALD<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London, between 26 and 28 January 1884]</p>
<p>Enclosed I beg to hand you post office order 10[sh.] 10 for my year's subscription to <i>Justice.</i></p>
<p>I am so overcharged with work, not only for the immediate future, but for a considerable period of time to come, that it would be folly on my part to promise contributions to your paper. I have been disabled from active work for the last six months and am only now slowly re-gaining the strength necessary to accomplish my most urgent task — to prepare for the press the manuscripts left by my late friend Marx. So that I am bound to devote all my time. I did promise an article to <i>To-Day</i> but that was in better days and I am afraid they too will have to wait.

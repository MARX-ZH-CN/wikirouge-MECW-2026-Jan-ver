MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN RAMSGATE</p>
<p>[London,] 25 May 1876</p>
<p>Dear FRED,</p>
<p>At the same time as this letter I am posting off Most's manuscript<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>in the inadequately packed state in which it arrived. I opened the enclosed scrawl from Wilhelm<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>because I thought it had something to do with Most's affair. In addition, I removed from your house a communication from the GREAT NORTHERN RAILWAY intending to forward it to you because I thought it was a business letter, but now discover it to be simply a PROGRAMME OF TOURIST ARRANGEMENTS.</p>
<p>I consider that, if one is to adopt a 'position vis-à-vis these gentlemen' one can do so only by criticising Dühring without any compunction. He has obviously been secretly at work among the literary loutish <i>careerists</i> devoted to him in order to obviate such criticism; they for their part have been counting on Liebknecht's weakness of which they are well aware. It was, BY THE BY, Liebknecht's duty, and he should be told as much, to let these laddies know that he had repeatedly asked for such criticism and that we had long (for the business started after my first return from Karlsbad<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>) refused on the grounds that the work was too paltry. As he knows, and as his letters to us go to prove, the thing only seemed worth doing when, by repeatedly passing on to us the louts' letters, he drew our attention to the threat of debased propaganda within the party.</p>
<p>As regards Mr Most <i>in specie,</i> he must by the nature of things regard Dühring as an authentic thinker because of the latter's having broadcast the discovery, not only in a lecture to workers in Berlin, but subsequently in black and white, that Most was the only one to have made some sense out of <i>Capital.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>Dühring systematically flatters these louts—something they cannot complain we do. Most and Co.'s vexation over the way you <i>dumbfounded</i> the Swabian Proudhonist<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>is typical. It serves as a terrible example before which they quail, and they are trying to prevent such a thing ever happening again by means of tittle-tattle, stalwart bonhomie and outraged brotherly love.</p>
<p>Certainly, the root of the trouble is and will remain Liebknecht's want of manuscripts, in which, generally speaking, his editorial talent seems to be concentrated. However, the pettiness with which he avoids according Becker's history of the French Commune<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>so much as a word of recognition, let alone publishing an extract or two from it, proves that even the want of manuscripts is not the <i>only</i> governing factor.</p>
<p>You may remember that, in a recent conversation we had about Turkey, I drew your attention to the possibility of a puritan party (based on the Koran) amongst the Turks. This has now supervened. According to a news item from Constantinople in the <i>Frankfurter Zeitung,</i> there is a plan, if things continue as they are, to remove the Sultan and put his brother in his place.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>The correspondent, who speaks Turkish and has much personal intercourse with Turks in Constantinople, insists <i>inter alia</i> that they know very well what Ignatiyev is up to, and that he is the source of all the disquieting rumours circulating among the Christians in Constantinople. Of one thing we may be sure: the Turks are not to be got rid of WITHOUT HARNESS ON THEIR BACK, and the Russians, who did not dare (or, perhaps, could not, due to lack of money) act swiftly and thus seize time by the forelock, may perhaps by the present ADVENTURE contribute more to the collapse of their own régime than to that of the Turks in Europe.</p>
<p>Jennychen is well, but the little boy is somewhat seedy, though it's nothing of consequence, the doctor says. He is to be called Jean (after Longuet's father) Laurent (NICKNAME OF LAURA) Frederick (in your honour).</p>
<p>The Copenhagen people have invited me by telegram, as well as in a letter to Pio (who left on Monday<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>), to attend a working men's congress (beginning of June).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup>It's fantastic to suppose I should now be able to give guest performances of this kind.</p>
<p>Today our park has been boarded off. Funny how ancient Teutonic customs survive as curiosities in England. This is the safeguarding of 'genuine freehold' by fencing off and hence separating it from the common mark.</p>
<p>Pumps has written long letters to my wife and Tussy. Even if the spelling sometimes isn't up to scratch, she has really made astonishing progress in the matter of style and ease of expression, which are far more important.</p>
<p>Kindest regards to Madame Lizzy.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. Marx</p>
<p>What a jackass Dizzy<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup>has become! At a moment when England is completely isolated, he insists on keeping a dozen or more Fenians to himself!<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>As regards 'Richter'/ Liebknecht shouldn't confine himself to mere HINTS when uttering warnings of this kind.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup>While there may be a possibility that my address book disappeared along with Richter, I don't for the time being believe it.</p>
<p>The fact of Eichhoff's working for Arnim was, of course, known to us long before Liebknecht, nor is there anything in the least surprising about it, in view of Eichhoff's hatred of Bismarck and Stieber. Notabene, in the <i>Frankfurter Zeitung</i> there is a Prussian <i>warrant</i> against Arnim, in accordance with which he is to be relieved of his money and handed over to the Berlin police; the authorities abroad will have their expenses paid and are assured of their services being requited in kind! (This on account of the <i>suppression of documents</i> for which he had already been sentenced.)

<li id="cite_note-11"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-11">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">At the House of Commons sitting on 22 May 1876, one of the Irish M.P.s inquired of Prime Minister Disraeli whether the government intended to amnesty the Fenians who were still in prison. Disraeli stated that 15 Fenians remained imprisoned, and that the government had no intention of pardoning them since it regarded them as 'criminals and deserters'. The statement provoked a storm of indignation among the Irish M.P.s.

The <i>Fenians</i> were Irish revolutionaries who had taken their name from the 'Féne', the ancient population of Ireland. Their first organisations appeared in the 1850s among the Irish immigrants in the USA, and later in Ireland itself. The secret Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood, as the organisation was known in the early 1860s, aimed at establishing an independent Irish republic by means of an armed uprising. The Fenians, who expressed the interests of the Irish peasantry, came chiefly from the urban petty bourgeoisie and intellectuals, and believed in conspiratorial tactics. The British government attempted to suppress the Fenian movement by severe police reprisals. In September 1865 it arrested a number of Fenian leaders, who were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment (O'Donovan Rossa received a life sentence). In 1867, following the abortive attempt at an uprising, hundreds of Irishmen were thrown into prison.

Marx and Engels, who repeatedly pointed to the weak sides of the Fenian movement, their reliance on conspiracy and sectarian errors, nevertheless had a high regard for its revolutionary character and did their best to encourage it to embark on mass struggle and joint action with the English working class.

In the 1870s, the Fenian movement declined.</span>

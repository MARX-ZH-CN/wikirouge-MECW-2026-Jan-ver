MARX TO ENGELS<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>IN MANCHESTER
<br>[London,] 6 March 1868
<br>DEAR FRED,
<br>BEST THANKS FOR THE.£10. The copies of <i>Social-Demokrat</i> promised by Meissner have not arrived. This shows that he is not at all precise. Thus for instance the copies for Paris have not been dispatched either. There the worthy Moses<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> has prevaricated for so long<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> that the <i>Courrier français</i> has now finally announced that as the result of the many <i>amendes,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </i> etc., it will soon completely quit the stage.
<br>I have not seen Eichhoff's lucubrations and anyway not the <i>Zukunft</i> for a very long time.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> Since Eichhoff's brother<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> is a bookseller and specialises in political economy (he is the publisher of several opera of Dr Dühring), this is reason enough for Eichhoff to deliver lectures on the same subject.
<br>My head is in a sorry state. But that should 'disappear' BY AND BY, as soon as the last traces of carbuncledom have gone.
<br>I wrote to Holland<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> again yesterday since the matter is becoming <i>brûlante.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> Old Lafargue<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> has dealt with the necessary marriage BANNS, etc., in Bordeaux, and has sent all the papers here. He now expects that the wedding will take place here at the beginning of next month, and that the pair will go to Paris, to which he will later move. We, however, have not yet risked taking the necessary steps here for the BANNS, since my wife has not yet been able to acquire even the most essential things for Laura. For worthy Freiligrath all this went very smoothly, but then he is 'noble'.
<br>As soon as this affair is SETTLED, it will be a great relief for the entire household, since Lafargue is as good as living with us, which perceptibly increases EXPENSES.
<br>As far as the 'reviews' are concerned, I think that after you have supplied Liebknecht<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> you should abandon the German ones and only pursue the English. First, the echo of an English review in Germany is more powerful than vice versa, and secondly this is, after all, the only country where finally money can be made from the business.
<br>Mr Macleod has nevertheless achieved a 2nd edition of his lousy and pedantic-scholastic book on BANKS.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11" id="cite_ref-11">[11]</a></sup> He is a very stilted jackass who expresses every banal tautology 1. in algebraic form, and 2. constructs it geometrically. I have already given him a passing kick in the pamphlet published by Duncker.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12" id="cite_ref-12">[12]</a></sup> His 'great' discovery is: credit <i>is</i> capital.
<br><i>Salut</i>
<br>Your
<br>K. M.

<li id="cite_note-11"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-11">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The<i> Civil War in America</i> broke out in April 1861. The Southern slaveholders rose against the Union and formed the Confederacy of the Southern States. The war was caused mainly by the conflict between the two social systems: the capitalist system of wage labour established in the North and the slave system dominant in the South. The Civil War, which had the nature of a bourgeois-democratic revolution, underwent two stages in its development: the period of a constitutional war for maintaining the Union and the period of a revolutionary war for the abolition of slavery. The decisive role in the defeat of the Southern slaveholders and the victory of the North in April 1865 was played by the workers, farmers and the Negroes. The causes and the nature of war in America were analysed by Marx in the articles published in the Vienna newspaper<i> Die Presse</i> (see present edition, Vol. 19).
The discontinuance of cotton imports from America as a result of the blockade of the Southern States by the Northern fleet caused a crisis in the cotton industry of several European countries. In England, for two or three years beginning in 1862, over 75 per cent of the spinners and weavers in Lancashire, Cheshire and other counties were fully or partly unemployed. Despite privation and distress, the European proletariat gave all possible support to the American fighters against slavery.</span>

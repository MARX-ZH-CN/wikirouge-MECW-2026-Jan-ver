ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 19 January 1869</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>You must excuse me for replying so late and so briefly, but recently we have had nothing but misfortune at home. Scarcely is Sarah<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>better, than Lizzie gets violent gastric catarrh, which I treated for a long while, and scarcely is this over, and she gets, as the result of an injury to her toe, an inflammation of the lymph ducts in her foot and leg, which could have become very unpleasant, but is now nearly over—and before she could get up, Mary Ellen returns sick from her parents, where she had spent a few days. What it is I shall only find out tomorrow, since Gumpert will be coming only then: he fears scarlet fever; but, up till now, there has been no sign of a rash. In addition, there have been all sorts of stupid invitations that could not be refused—a lot of work at the office, and you will grasp that I have enough going on. With best greetings to the ladies.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.</p>
<p>Did you get the wine that time, and also the <i>Social-Demokrat</i> and Ténot,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>etc.?

ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>[Manchester,] 2 February 1852
<br>Dear Marx,
<br>Do you recall a refugee by the name of <i>Richter</i> from Torgau (Prussian Saxony), a saddler and upholsterer—who used to be in London? This man, whom I recall having seen in London—tall, fair, the manners of a refugee—suddenly calls on me here, ostensibly having returned from Barmen where, he maintains, he worked for a time without papers; he brings greetings from Hühnerbein, etc. I can call to mind absolutely nothing about him except that I have seen him before. At all events, our register of refugees and Pfänder's or Rings' good memory should be able to tell us more particulars about him. I rather suspect the fellow is a member of Willich's clique<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> —in which case I shall chuck him out at once. The man has already found work here.
<br>So far, I've been able to discover nothing in <i>The Times</i> about the business of our people in Cologne.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I am only awaiting your reply to write immediately, <i>s'il y a lieu</i>, to <i>The Daily News</i>. The American STEAMER is in but, much to my surprise, no letter from Weydemeyer, or any copies of the paper,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> at least up till now. However, it's still possible that these may arrive tomorrow.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.
<br>Tell Pieper I shall shortly be sending him his £2, now the new month has begun.

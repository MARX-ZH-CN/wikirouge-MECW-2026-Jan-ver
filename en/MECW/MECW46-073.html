MARX TO LAURA LAFARGUE</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Argenteuil,] 9 August 1881</p>
<p>Dear Laurachen,</p>
<p>I can only write you a line or two as the post is about to go. Mama is in a serious condition as a result of her growing weakness. It was therefore my intention (as we shall only be able to travel by easy stages this time) to set off at all costs at the end of the week, and I informed the patient accordingly. Yesterday, however, she thwarted my plan by sending out our washing. So there can be no question of our leaving before the beginning of next week.</p>
<p>We may — depending on the state she is in — stop in Boulogne <i>for a few days.</i> The doctor<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> thinks that (given favourable conditions) the sea air might momentarily have an invigorating effect.</p>
<p>Next time (but for this purpose you must write <i>at once</i> giving me your latest address) I shall send you a fuller report. Best wishes to Paul.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>OLD NICK

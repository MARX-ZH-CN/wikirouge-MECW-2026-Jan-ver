ENGELS TO MARX
<br>IN LONDON
<br>Manchester, 11 August 1867
<br>Dear Moor,
<br>Enclosed a five-pound-note which I fortunately obtained yester- day and which will now satisfy your FRENCHMAN. Also Dronke's letter. So, the little man has got himself properly into the mire with his petty speculations. I fear that, if he is to shake off his obligations in respect of the Barnedi shares, he will have to go through the BANKRUPTCY COURT. It is very hard for the little fellow, firstly the court-case over the insurance business, and now these blows. However, I assume he will still have his agency, and with its help and with speculation a little less heated, he may soon restore his fortunes.
<br>I have cursorily read through as far as sheet 32<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and will give you my comments on it in due course; the numerous examples in this section, on cursory first reading, somewhat obscure its coherence. But there are some very fine things in it, and both capital and its sycophants will be eternally grateful to you.
<br>On my journey back here<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I had the added pleasure of a rifle-bullet shattering the window and flying through the carriage not 12 inches from my chest: some VOLUNTEER probably wished to demonstrate yet again that he ought not to be entrusted with a firearm. It is the strangest RAILWAY ACCIDENT I have ever encoun- tered.
<br>Lizzie<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> also had a rather bad return journey, she says she will never go by sea again.
<br>Kindest regards to your wife.
<br>Your
<br>F. E.

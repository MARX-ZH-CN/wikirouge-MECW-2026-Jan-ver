MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 6 January 1859<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Will you be so good as to send me Lupus' address. If you have done with Serbia,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> there is fresh material READY to hand in the (proposed) changes in the <i>Landwehr</i> in Prussia, on which I shall have to report.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>While Mr Edgar Bauer is editor<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> under THE AUSPICES of Scherzer and is even adopting 'class contradictions' and giving them a Berlin twist, Mr Gottfried Kinkel, who can't afford to let slip the opportunity presented by the Kinkel REVIVAL, is bringing out a weekly in London, to wit, the <i>Hermann</i> (not the Cheruscan, I presume, but Goethe's SIMPLETON).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> Freiligrath, or so it <i>seems</i> from a brief note he sent me, is already REPENTANT of the BLUNDER<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> he committed. If you write, tell him (but <i>most politely,</i> OF COURSE, for he complains about the <i>crude, brash tone of your letters)</i> that in Manchester there is much talk among the Germans about <i>his</i> alliance with Kinkel; you might also slip in Heckscher's anecdote, quoting your source. At <i>this</i> particular time it is <i>of moment to us</i> that Freiligrath should break with these swine for good.</p>
<p>Apropos, Willich is now editing the gymnasts' paper in Cincinnati.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> Was 'selected' as editor there. He accepted the appointment (doubtless obtained for him by Cluss so as to rid himself of the man) in a superb circular letter in which he says</p>
<p>that the time has come for him to take charge of propaganda since the people are not in need of military leaders just now.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

On 30 November 1858 the so-called  St. Andrew Skupstina met after a long interval. At the session, the liberals, who  had joined forces with the supporters of the Obrenovic dynasty, clashed with  the ruling Ustavobranitelji (Defenders of Constitution) group representing the  big landowners, traders and the top officialdom. The conflict led to the  deposition of Alexander Karageorgievic and the reinstatement of Milos  Obrenovic, who agreed to carry out a number of liberal reforms. The St.  Andrew Skupstina abolished the oligarchic council set up under the 1838  Constitution, restored the Skupstina as a permanent legislative body, and  declared freedom of the press. Though the liberal reforms were moderate and  short-lived, the fall of the Ustavobranitelji regime gave an impulse to Serbia's  economic and cultural development.  It is unknown whether Engels wrote the article on Serbia.—364, 366</span>

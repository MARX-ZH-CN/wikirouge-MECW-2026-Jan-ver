MARX TO ISAAC IRONSIDE<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>IN SHEFFIELD</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>Manchester, [21 June 1856] 34 Butler St., Greenheys</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I received your letter d.d. June 14 this morning only, as it had to be sent to me here to Manchester where I shall stay for some weeks.</p>
<p>I have duly considered your proposal, and, on the whole, accede to it.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> In a matter like this, it is impossible to mention expressly every small particular, to agree upon the size of type pp., neither can I anticipate that any difficulties may arise therefrom, nor from the reservations to make as to 'copy <i>used'.</i></p>
<p>I shall therefore provide you in time for next Saturday's but one's publication with fully 2 columns of matter and keep you amply supplied every week to that extent.</p>
<p>It would be most convenient to me (if your arrangements admit of it) to receive a remittance say after every fresh weekly publication.</p>
<p>As to your reprinting the papers in your serials, I have no objection, reserving to myself, of course, the right of using the materials, later on, in any way I may see it fit to use them.</p>
<p>As I am sure that you will not suppress historical truth out of prejudice or party-consideration [...]<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> </p>
<p>As to the latter point you will think it only just, that should any points be suppressed, which in my conviction are of decisive</p>
<p>historical importance, I shall consider myself obliged to stop the publication.</p>
<p>In thanking you for the serials you were so kind to send me, I cannot but regret that you did not think fit to communicate to me the proof-sheets of the 'Story of the life of Lord Palmerston'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Sentences, historical data, quotations from Palmerston's speeches—everything is so disfigured by <i>errata</i> that, in my opinion, the pamphlet, in its present form, is not only useless but positively mischievous.</p>
<p>A few words on the plan of the whole publication will suffice. I do not adopt the usual manner of opening the whole theme by general considerations, but on the contrary commence with facts.</p>
<p>In contradistinction to the usual manner of historical writers, I shall not commence this publication with general considerations, but with facts. The first chapter will be composed of despatches belonging to different epochs of that century, in order to show up the Russian spirit of English diplomacy during the 18th.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>I hope I need not tell you that I am no 'commercial' writer and that no [...]<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> </p>

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Only part of the draft of Marx's letter to Isaac Ironside, editor of<i> The Sheffield  Free Press,</i> has reached us. The beginning, up to and including the words 'I  shall consider myself obliged to stop the publication', is written in pencil in  Engels' hand with changes in ink by Marx. The rest of the text, with much  struck out, is in Marx's writing. That the draft was written on 21 June 1856 can  be seen from Marx's letter to his wife written on the same day. Ironside  answered the letter on 23 June 1856.—57</span>

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">This refers to the publication of Marx's<i> Revelations of the Diplomatic History of the  18th Century</i> in<i> The Sheffield Free Press</i> (see Note 61). Further on Marx speaks  of Ironside's intention to publish this work in the Urquhartites'<i> Free Press  Serials,</i> an intention which failed to materialise.—57</span>

This was a reproduction of the series as  published under the same title between December 1855 and February 1856 in  several issues of<i> The Free Press,</i> the Urquhartites' London paper. Apart from  this, one of the articles, published in<i> The Sheffield Free Press</i> in November 1855,  appeared as a pamphlet in Sheffield in 1856<i> (The Free Press Serials, </i> No. 4a).—44, 58</span>

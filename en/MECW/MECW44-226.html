MARX TO EDOUARD VAILLANT</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 24 May 1872</p>
<p>My dear Vaillant,</p>
<p>Serraillier has received a letter from Brussels from some of the proscribed persons over there—which in my view makes it necessary that something be done here to avert if at all possible any further rumpus amongst the Communards. It is for this reason that I have agreed with Serraillier to ask you (and via you <i>Arnaud),</i> Cournet and Ranvier to come to my house tomorrow evening <i>(Saturday at 8 or 9 o'clock,</i> whichever is more convenient) to discuss what should be done (needless to say the General Council has nothing to do with the affair).</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>Karl Marx</p>
<p>I have had a letter from Rochat,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>who is presently working in a coal-mine in the Borinage.

MARX TO JOSEPH WEYDEMEYER<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN NEW YORK</p>
<p>London [between 23 January and 2 February 1852]</p>
<p>Dear Weydemeyer,</p>
<p>Stechan sends you the following notes, but do not mention his name. Later he will send the original article over his signature.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.</p>
<p>Dear Weydemeyer,</p>
<p>Do not print this stuff <i>word for word</i>, only make use of it. It is written in a very philistine style.</p>

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">These are Marx's covering notes to Stechan's contributions to Die Revolution, which Marx promised to Weydemeyer in his letter of 23 January 1852. The material contained some concrete facts concerning the persecution of the participants in the socialist and communist movements in Germany and the position of the Communist League members, Bürgers, Becker, Daniels, Otto and others, then under investigation in Cologne, but it was not a finished article. The material reached Weydemeyer in New York before 17 February but was not used because Die Revolution had ceased to appear</span>

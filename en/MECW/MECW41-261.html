MARX TO FERDINAND FREILIGRATH<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 15 December 1862</p>
<p>Dear Freiligrath,</p>
<p>The £5 returned herewith 'by hand' with my best thanks. You will excuse its arriving 5 days late. The family in Trier was so taken aback by the sudden and unexpected death of my brother-in-law, R. Schmalhausen, that there was some delay over sending me the money.</p>
<p>I have been spending a few days in Liverpool and Manchester, those centres of cottonocracy and pro-slavery enthusiasm. Among the great bulk of the middle-classes and the aristocracy of those towns you may observe the greatest eclipsus of the human mind ever chronicled in the history of modern times.</p>
<p>I shall drop in at your office for a couple of minutes one of these days, since I also have some literary business to talk over with you.</p>
<p>One of these days, I shall reply to <i>les paroles d'un croyant</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Kindest regards from my family to yours.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

In the spring of 1862, following Freiligrath's breach with Kinkel, who had joined the National Association (see Note 24), relations between Marx and Freiligrath began returning to normal.</span>

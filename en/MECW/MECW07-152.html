<br>The petitioner, the politically unreliable Dr. Karl Marx, was born in Trier on May 5, 1818, lived in Cologne in 1842-43, worked as editor of the Rheinische Zeitung, subsequently he went abroad and from there he obtained the enclosed permission to emigrate, which was issued by his home town Trier,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> and has therefore lost his Prussian citizenship.
<br>According to his statement he is working on a book on economics which he intends to publish and he proposes to live partly on the proceeds of his writings and partly the personal property of his wife,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> who, together with their three children,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> is still staying in Trier. The stamp attached to the application has been cancelled and is duly enclosed herewith.
<br>Cologne, April 19, 1848
<br>Hünermund,
<br>Police Inspector

<br>Sir,
<br>As long as I had a hand in the German press I attacked the <em>Allgemeine Zeitung</em> and the <em>Allgemeine Zeitung</em> attacked me. However, this does not of course prevent me from assisting the Allgemeine Zeitung; as far as it lies in my power, in a case in which it has in my view fulfilled the <em>primary</em> duty of the press: that of the denunciation of humbug. The enclosed document would be a <em>legal</em> document here in London. I do not know whether it is the same in <em>Augsburg</em>. I have procured the said document because Blind refused to stand by the statement which he had made to me and others, which I passed on to Liebknecht, and which allowed the latter no doubts about the denunciation contained in the anonymous pamphlet.
<br>Yours very sincerity,
<br><em>Dr. K. Marx</em>

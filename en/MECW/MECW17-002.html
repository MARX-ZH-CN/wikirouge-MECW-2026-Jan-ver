<p>Sir,</p>
<p>As long as I had a hand in the German press I attacked the <i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i> and the <i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i> attacked me. However, this does not of course prevent me from assisting the Allgemeine Zeitung; as far as it lies in my power, in a case in which it has in my view fulfilled the <i>primary</i> duty of the press: that of the denunciation of humbug. The enclosed document would be a <i>legal</i> document here in London. I do not know whether it is the same in <i>Augsburg</i>. I have procured the said document because Blind refused to stand by the statement which he had made to me and others, which I passed on to Liebknecht, and which allowed the latter no doubts about the denunciation contained in the anonymous pamphlet.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerity,</p>
<p><i>Dr. K. Marx</i>
</p>

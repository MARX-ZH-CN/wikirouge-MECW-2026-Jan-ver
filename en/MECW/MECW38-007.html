<p>Notes :
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here, Marx writes about the <i>Vorwarts! Pariser Deutsche Monatsschrift</i> which Heinrich Boernstein planned to publish instead of the newspaper <i>Vorwarts!</i> The prospectus of the monthly published in German and French on 1 January 1845 (its publication date helps in determining the approximate date of this letter) stated that one of the reasons for the reformation of <i>Vorwarts!</i> was that no caution-money was needed for publishing a journal as distinct from a newspaper. The journal of eight printed sheets was to appear on the 16th of each month. The expulsion of Marx and other contributors to <i>Vorwarts!</i> from France prevented the publication of the first issue, the proof sheets of which had already been printed.</p>
<p>As is seen from this letter, and that of Engels to Marx written approximately 20 January 1845, Marx intended to write a critical review of Stirner's <i>Der Einzige und sein Eigenthum</i> at the end of December 1844 and originally wanted to publish it in the monthly <i>Vorwarts!</i> There is no information on whether this plan materialized. It is only known that two years later, Marx and Engels scathingly criticized Stirner's book in the <i>German Ideology</i>.

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>It is impossible for me to let you have the review of Stirner before next week. Therefore deliver the specimen copy without my contribution; Buergers will let you have an article in its stead.</p>
<p>You shall have my article next week.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully</p>
<p><i>Marx</i>

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London, 16 February 1865]</p>
<p>DEAR FREDERICK, Jones has written, asking me to send him ABOUT 1 DOZEN CARDS; I am sending you 1 DOZEN for him and 1 for yourself. What you can't</p>
<p><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>dispose of WITHIN A REASONABLE period of time you can send back. Price Is. Id. PER CARD.</p>
<p>I remind you AGAIN that <i>Pettier</i> may, in my opinion, be very useful in <i>this matter.</i> For years now he has had many PERSONAL RELATIONS (as SINGMASTER and socialist) with the Manchester workers.</p>
<p>You must return enclosed letter (to Lessner) when you have read it. How do you think we should MANAGE this business? J shall keep my mouth shut, of course, but <i>Lessner</i> won't be able to do that.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>I am pleased to see in today's <i>Times</i> that the Prussian Chamber has accepted the motion <i>against</i> the Combination Laws. The government will now arrange for it to be rejected in the <i>LORDS HOUSE.</i> Red Becker<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>—no doubt spurred on by your literary contribution<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>—has brought in the amendment about the rural population.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Salut</i></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

Matzeratt, to Friedrich Lessner dated 8 January 1865. Matzeratt wrote about the disagreements between Bernhard Becker and Carl Klings in the General Association of German Workers. On behalf of a group of the Association's members, he asked Lessner to inquire about Marx's opinion and help them to clarify the matter. As can be seen from Engels' letter to Marx of 7 February 1865, Becker gained the upper hand over Klings (see this volume, p. 82).</span>

He also proposed to abolish the law of 24 April 1854 on the punishment of servants and day labourers for the violation of their duties.</span>

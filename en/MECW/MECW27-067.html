<p>Dear Comrade,</p>
<p>I ask you to convey my sincere thanks to the Committee and the members of the Communist Workers 'Educational Society for their kindness in remembering my seventy-third birthday. May the Society prosper for many years to come, and always hold high the old red banner that it first unfurled here in England!</p>
<p>With best wishes,</p>
<p><i><b>F. Engels</b></i>

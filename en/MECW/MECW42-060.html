<br><i>To Engels in Manchester</i>
<br><b>[London,] 4 March 1865</b>
<br><b>Dear Fred</b>,
<br>Our statement is in today's <em>Social-Demokrat.</em> Although claiming that the statement from these 'gentlemen' requires no further comment, Mr Schweitzer has, nevertheless, '<em>anonymously</em>' devoted one of his 'bloody pretentious' <b>leaders</b> to us. Lassalle and B. Becker, 'President of Mankind', <b>for ever</b>! At all events, I have Mr Schweitzer's exceedingly humble letter of invitation, etc. in my possession. Siebel has sent 5 newspapers (the <em>Barmer,</em> the <em>Elberfelder,</em> the <em>Düsseldorfer,</em> the <em>Rheinische</em> and the <em>Neue Frankfurter</em>) carrying the statement. The enclosed cutting is from the <em>Elberfelder.</em> I am glad, firstly, that we are 'out' and, secondly, that we were 'in'. If we had not been, we would never have penetrated the '<em>mystères</em> of Lassalle'.
<br>I have written to Kugelmann (please send his prescription back to me) about your pamphlet (it looks <em>very good</em> in print; if there is a 2nd impression, only a sentence here and there would need to be altered). Can you send me another 2 <b>copies</b>? I would like to use Eccarius' good offices to put two short notices in Bender's rag (London) and in the <em>Hermann,</em> but that will hardly be possible unless I let them have 2 Copies.
<br>The '<em>Polish Meeting'</em> (<b>Wednesday</b>) went off very well, and full, although the <b>bourgeois</b> had done everything they could to wreck it by declaring it '<b>inopportune'.</b>
<br>Affairs <em>In France are very complicated</em>. I will tell you about it and send you Schily's <b>report</b> (I have to translate extracts from it this very day and accordingly inform the <b>subcommittee</b> of it) in my next letter. For the moment, I shall just mention that there is <b>a fight</b> between our original workers' representatives and the politico-social gentlemen (including the boss of the <em>Association so</em> admired by Moses) as to <em>who is</em> to be in contact with us. The [French], particularly the <em>Parisian</em> workers (although already links with 25 other French cities, too) literally regard the London <b>Council</b> as a workers' government 'abroad'.
<br>Major Wolff has returned after serving his sentence in Alessandria.
<br>Apropos: did I tell you that <em>Mazzini</em> later secretly communicated his 'displeasure' to Fontana after all (and his predilection for K. Blind, whom he had himself branded as a 'liar')?
<br>Your wine came yesterday; received with <b>thanks</b>.
<br>For the past week my brother-in-law from the Cape has been here again; he leaves next Tuesday. My niece, from Maastricht came with him (daughter of my sister, widow Schmalhausen); I shall have to take her back in <b>about a week later</b>.
<br>My old trouble is plaguing me in various sensitive and 'aggravating' places, so that sitting down is difficult.
<br>Apropos: is the Lupus affair still not quite wound up? Ditto I never heard a word from Mr Borchardt about the outstanding money he was going to collect in. You will see from the enclosed scrawl, which is just one example, how I am being sent claims of every conceivable kind, things I had totally forgotten about. This is the most recent to have raised its head from the days of the <em>Neue Rheinische Zeitung.</em> It is something I have to take into account in every possible way because otherwise the fellows will make a public scandal.
<br>It seems all up with <b>Confederacy</b>.
<br><em>Salut.</em>
<br>Your<br>K. M.
<br>I wonder if you could send me the papers from the Manchester press relating to the <b>cotton-crisis</b>?

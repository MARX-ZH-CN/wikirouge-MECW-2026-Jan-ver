<p>Note from MECW vol. 2, 1975 :
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The Bedouin</i> was Engels' first work to appear in print. He wrote it at the beginning of his stay in Bremen, where he worked as a clerk in a trading company from July 1838 to March 1841. When preparing this poem for the press the editors of the <i>Bremisches Conversationsblatt</i> changed the last stanza without the author's permission. The original text is cited by Engels in his letter to the Graeber brothers dated September 17-18, 1838.

<p>Now the bell rings, and suddenly<br>The silken curtain swift ascends.<br>And all in hushed expectancy<br>Wait for the evening to commence.</p>
<p>No Kotzebue commands the scene<br>To set the merry audience roaring.<br>No Schiller of the earnest mien<br>Steps forth, his golden words outpouring.</p>
<p>Sons of the desert, proud and free,<br>Walk on to greet us, face to face;<br>But pride is vanished utterly,<br>And freedom lost without a trace.</p>
<p>They jump at money's beck and call<br>(As once that lad from dune to dune<br>Bounded for joy). They're silent, all,<br>Save one who sings a dirge-like tune.</p>
<p>The audience, amazed and awed<br>By what these acrobats can do,<br>Applauds them, just as it applauds<br>The trumperies of Kotzebue.</p>
<p>Fleet nomads of the desert lands,<br>You've braved the sun's fierce noontide rays<br>Through harsh Morocco's burning sands,<br>Through valleys where the date-palms sway.</p>
<p>And through the garden paradise<br>Of Bled-el-Djerid once you swept.<br>You turned your wits to bold forays.<br>Your steeds to battle proudly stepped.</p>
<p>You sat there, where moon lustres spill<br>By rare springs in a palm-tree grove,<br>And lovely lips with gracious skill<br>A fairy-story garland wove.</p>
<p>Sleeping in narrow tents you lay<br>In love's warm arms, with dreams all round,<br>Till sunrise ushered in the day<br>And camels made their bellowing sound.</p>
<p>They jump at money's beck and call,<br>And not at Nature's primal urge.<br>Their eyes are blank, they're silent, all,<br>Except for one who sings a dirge.

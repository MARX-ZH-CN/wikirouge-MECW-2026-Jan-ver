ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE</p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>London, 10 June 1891</p>
<p>Dear Sorge,</p>
<p>I am up to the eyes in the new edition of the <i>Origin of the Family, etc.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>; it has been necessary to go through all the relevant literature of the past 8 years and its quintessence must now be worked into the book, which is no joke, especially in view of the many interruptions. However the worst is behind me and I shall at last be able to get back to Volume III.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>I have had to cut down on the whole of my corre- spondence, otherwise I should make no progress at all.</p>
<p>In Berlin — <i>strictly between ourselves,</i> for Schlüter must not know that it is / who have given you the information; he cannot always keep his mouth shut and if you tell him, he's sure to know that it comes from me — in Berlin, then, the chaps have finally come round to the view that Liebknecht is a windbag and nothing more. Earlier on the position was such that they <i>had</i> to give him the post of editor of the <i>Vorwärts</i> and at the same time make him an honorary member of the Executive. I had long been aware that this was bound to bring matters to a head; it was inevitable. They now find that he is editing the paper out of existence, for in the first place he does nothing him- self and, in the second, he is standing in the way of others who <i>could</i> do something. So it's scandalous that he should allow his son-in-law Geiser to write botched leading articles for it, articles of such dreary arrogance and tedious ineffectiveness as to be beyond the capabilities of anyone save their author — and this is the Geiser who, morally speaking, was chucked out of the party at St Gallen.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>For the mo- ment there's no telling how the affair will end. They have offered Liebknecht another position in which he would act both as a popular speaker and in his earlier capacity of journalistic franc-tireur, but this he construes as a dismissal. Now they don't know how to set about pensioning him off in a decent manner, and to do so in such a way that he will accept — for that is what it really boils down to. The oddest part of all is that while the Anti-Socialist Law<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>was in force, precluding the outbreak of this conflict, Liebknecht hardly changed at all, or at most continued along a course upon which he had long since embarked, and that the chaps now find that, upon his transfer to Berlin from his Borsdorf retreat, he no longer bears the slightest re- semblance to the Liebknecht of old — in other words Liebknecht as <i>they</i> had imagined him. The real point is that the <i>others</i> have pro- gressed and now suddenly notice the difference; they imagine that it is <i>they</i> who have remained as they were, which is by no means the case.</p>
<p>Now for something else. Stanislaw<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>writes to tell me that Anna<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>has approached Paris for money and has actually got some, or will be doing so; these attempts at extortion are really a bit thick, he says, and suggests we write to America lest there should be further useless expenditure over there on the young madame's behalf. Accordingly he has already written to you and asks me to do the same. He de- scribes her, Anna's, way of going about things as downright blackmail.</p>
<p>Today we have at last had a semblance of summer; the vegetation is a whole month behind and in that respect the spring is not yet properly over, though otherwise we've seen no sign of it.</p>
<p>Thank you for the pirated American edition. Schlüter has told me some curious things about it.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>Please thank him for his very de- tailed letter which I cannot unfortunately reply to just now.</p>
<p>Over here the movement is making fine progress. The UNION of GAS- WORKERS and GENERAL LABOURERS is gradually coming to the fore, thanks above all to Tussy. The movement is advancing English- fashion, systematically, slowly but surely, and it is an odd, if highly significant phenomenon that both here and in America the people who make themselves out to be orthodox Marxists and have changed the concept of our movement into a rigid dogma to be learned by rote — that these people should figure both here and over there as a <i>mere sect.</i> But what is even more significant is the fact that whereas in Amer- ica these people are foreigners, i. e. Germans, over here they're Eng- lishmen born and bred, i. e. Hyndman &amp; Co. Tussy has just arrived so I'll close.</p>
<p>Regard from her, Louise and your old friend to you, your wife<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>and Schlüter,</p>
<p>F.E.</p>
<p>Tussy has just told me that at Whitsuntide — when she was on the point of leaving for the GASWORKERS' congress in Dublin —she too received a letter from Anna similar to the one sent to the Paris people.</p>

The congress unanimously passed a resolution cen suring those deputies who had had no valid grounds for behaving in this manner and expressed the hope that no responsible party posts would be given them in the future. Bruno Geiser was among those censured.</span>

<li id="cite_note-4"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-4">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The Anti-Socialist Law, initiated by the Bismarck government and passed by the Reichstag on 21 October 1878, was directed against the socialist and working-class movement. The Social-Democratic Party of Germany was virtually driven into the underground. All party and mass working-class organisations and their press were banned, socialist literature was subject to confiscation, Social-Democrats made the object of reprisals. However, with the active help of Marx and Engels, the Social- Democratic Party succeeded in overcoming both the opportunist (Eduard Bern stein et al.) and 'ultra-Left' (J. Most et al.) tendencies within its ranks and was able, by combining underground activities with an efficient utilisation of legal means, to use the period of the operation of the law for considerably strengthening and ex panding its influence among the masses. Prolonged in 1881, 1884, 1886 and 1888, the Anti-Socialist Law was repealed on 1 October 1890. For Engels' assessment of it see his article 'Bismarck and the German Working Men's Party' (present edition, Vol. 24, pp. 407-09).</span>

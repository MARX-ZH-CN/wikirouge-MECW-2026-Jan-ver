MARX TO ADOLPHE HUBERT</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Draft] [London, not before 14 August 1871]</p>
<p>Dear Citizen,</p>
<p>First of all I haven't got Mr Bigot's address, so cannot write to him direct. Moreover, I believe it would be safer to send any mail through you.</p>
<p>I cannot immediately lay my hands on the German journals relating to the Lefaivre incident,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> but in the issue of the <i>Volksstaat</i> (published in Leipzig and edited by Liebknecht), Mr Bigot will find the letter from Lefaivre as well as editorial comments on that letter. The trial of Liebknecht and Bebel has, by the bye, gained widespread notoriety.</p>
<p>In No. 63 of the <i>Volksstaat</i> (5 August 1871) (see marked passage) Mr Bigot will observe that the proceedings against Liebknecht, Bebel, etc., for <i>planning high treason axe</i> going ahead and that Lefaivre's letter figures amongst the documents used in the indictment.</p>
<p>For Jourde's defence I enclose a declaration by an Englishman, Mr Wm. Träte, in regard to the fire at the Ministry of Finance.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>I shall write to Willebrord<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> asking him to keep the things which he has received from Mr Bigot.</p>
<p>Fraternal greetings,</p>
<p>K. M.

<br><em>Cologne,</em> May 2. It is with especial satisfaction that we inform our readers that the meeting of the representatives of municipal councils of the Rhine Province convened by the praiseworthy Cologne municipal council has been <b>prohibited</b> by a simple government order.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> The "good citizens", who felt so "comfortable" when meetings of democrats were prohibited in September, <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> can now offer thanks to their lords and masters. In September 1848 the democrats' right of assembly was destroyed at least by the respectable violence of the state of siege; the Cologne municipal council's right of assembly, on the other hand, has met its end <em>by a kick</em> at a time when the legal basis is in finest flower.

The Prussian Government banned this meeting (the ban was published in the <em>Kölnische Zeitung</em> No. 104, May 2, 1849). Even so, the Cologne municipal council convoked a congress of delegates from the Rhine cities on May 8, 1849 in Cologne. The Congress came out in favour of the imperial Constitution and demanded the convocation of the dissolved Provincial Diet. It was made clear that, if the Prussian Government ignored the Congress's resolution, the question of the Rhine Province's secession from Prussia would be raised. This threat, however, was not supported by decisive action and remained merely an empty declaration, because the liberal majority of the Congress rejected the proposal to arm the people and to resist the authorities by force</span>

The military commandant's office issued an order prohibiting all associations pursuing "political and social aims", banned all meetings, disbanded and disarmed the civic militia, instituted courts martial and suspended publication of the <em>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</em> and a number of other democratic newspapers. A protest campaign compelled the Cologne military authorities to lift the state of siege on October 2. The <em>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</em> resumed publication on October 12</span>

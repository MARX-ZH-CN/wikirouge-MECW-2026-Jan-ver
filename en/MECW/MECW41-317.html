<br><i>To Jenny Marx in London</i>
<br>[Manchester,] 10 May 1864
<br>Dear Jenny,
<br><b>Poor</b> Lupus, as it now transpires — and as Borchardt already knew — had accumulated a nest-egg by dint of hard and unremitting work.
<br>In his will (of December 1863) he appointed Engels, Borchardt and myself his executors, and the notary has just read us his will. In it he leaves:
<br>1. £100 to the Manchester Schiller Institute
<br>2. £100 to Engels
<br>3. £100 to Borchardt and
<br>4. The entire residue, amounting to six or seven hundred pounds, to me (to you and the children should I <em>predecease</em> him; he took care of all eventualities), likewise his books and all other effects.
<br>I must now go to his lodgings and sort out his papers. Luckily he was living — during the final 6 or 7 weeks, at any rate — with exceptionally good and worthy people and enjoyed the best possible nursing. The inane telegrams about nursing attendants — of which Gumpert knew nothing — were sheer ostentation and consequentiality on the part of Bombastus B.
<br>A thousand kisses to you and the children.
<br>Your<br>Karl

MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 7 August 1855 28 Dean Street, Soho</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>The FAMILY (hence, for the most part, myself also) still in Camberwell. Pieper came and stayed with us for a week. I was thus prevented from writing, save for the necessary pieces for New York AND GERMANY. The article on the 'ARMIES' is splendid.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
<p>From the enclosed letter from Steffen you will see what a bad state our friend Daniels and Bürgers are in. I am particularly sorry about the first. I don't know whether, in my résumé of the report by the visitor from Yankeeland,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> I mentioned that Conrad Schramm is consumptive and is taking a cure of ass's milk <i>chez</i> former Field Marshal Blenker.</p>
<p>In the past weeks I have sent the <i>Tribune</i> a series of articles—i.e. 3—about Lord John Russell in which the little man is passed in review from the very beginning.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> However, it will soon be necessary to say SOME WORDS about the war and also, perhaps, about how the <i>affaire</i> is going in Asia.</p>
<p>Dronke has suffered a bitter disappointment. For it eventually transpired that the issue of a passport to Paris had been due to a misunderstanding on the part of the French Embassy; rather, express instructions had been given that he was not to be admitted into France. In a few days it will be decided whether or not he has obtained a post in Jersey.</p>
<p>Bonaparte has, within the bounds of pure reason, solved the problem I set him, namely 'to steal the whole of France in order to make a present of it to France again'.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> His manoeuvrings over the loan are significant experiments in that direction.</p>
<p>What do you think of the Austrian concentration of troops in Italy? Have you seen the 2nd <i>Mémoire d'un Officier Général</i>?<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> </p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

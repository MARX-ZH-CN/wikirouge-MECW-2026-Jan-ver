ENGELS TO PASQUALE MARTIGNETTI</p>
<p>IN BENEVENTO</p>
<p>England, Eastbourne, 22 August 1883<br>
4 Cavendish Place</p>
<p>Dear Citizen,</p>
<p>Please excuse my delay in replying to your letter of 25/6 and your postcard of 30/7.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>The need to finish in a short time the text of the 3rd German edition of <i>Capital</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>forced me to suspend all correspondence.</p>
<p>I do not know much about Ahn's method, and the dictionary you mention is entirely unknown to me. In order to learn a language the method I have always followed is this: I do not bother with grammar (except for declensions and conjugations, and pronouns) and I read, with a dictionary, the most difficult classical author I can find. Thus I began Italian with Dante, Petrarch and Ariosto, Spanish with Cervantes and Calderon, Russian with Pushkin. Then I read newspapers, etc. For German, I think the first part of Goethe's <i>Faust</i> might be suitable; it is written, for the most part, in a popular style, and the things which would seem difficult to you would also be difficult, without a commentary, for a German reader.</p>
<p>For the works of Marx, etc., you could approach the offices of the <i>Sozialdemokrat,</i> Hottingen-Zurich, Switzerland; it is the official organ of the German workers' party.</p>
<p>Thank you for the copies of the translation, which reached me in good condition, and also for kindly sending your photograph, in return for which I enclose mine.</p>
<p>Yours with regards,</p>
<p>F. Engels</p>
<p>The normal London address is fine; I am here at the seaside for a few weeks.

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">In a letter to Engels of 25 June 1883 Pasquale Martignetti thanked the recipient for endorsing his Italian translation of<i> Socialism: Utopian and Scientific</i> (see Note 70). Expressing his regret that he had not been able to translate from the German original, Martignetti asked Engels to advise him of a textbook which might help him to learn German; he also requested Engels to let him know where he might find works by Marx, Engels and other authors which the recipient could recommend as reading material. On 30 July Martignetti informed Engels that, as the latter had requested (see this volume, p. 37), he was sending him copies of the Italian translation of the above-mentioned work by Engels which had just appeared in Benevento.</span>

MARX TO PYOTR LAVROV
<br>IN LONDON
<br>[London,] 23 March 1877
<br>My dear Friend,
<br>I have received the article and it is now in the hands of the member of the House of Commons, to whom, by the by, I shall send the rectification.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>Beesly called on me yesterday; I spoke to him about an article by you<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> for the <i>Fortnightly.</i> He told me he would recommend you to John Morley, the editor-in-chief, but—and this is most disagreeable—it would have to be written in, or translated into, English before being sent to the editor. As to the length of the article, 16 pages is the usual requirement.
<br>Allsop did not give us his latest address; perhaps Le Blanc could get hold of it.
<br>Yesterday I received a letter from St Petersburg with a note advising me that a parcel containing several books had been sent off to me.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Unfortunately I have still to set eyes on it.
<br>Yours ever,
<br>Karl Marx

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">At Marx's request, Pyotr Lavrov compiled a résumé of judicial and police persecution in Russia, which Marx passed on to the Irish M. P. Keyes O'Clery. The latter used the information in his speeches delivered in the House of Commons on 3 and 14 May 1877 (see <i>MEGA,</i> Erste Abteilung, Band 25, S. 462). Pyotr Lavrov also wrote an article in French entitled 'La justice en Russie', which Marx helped to get printed in the British weekly <i>Vanity Fair</i> on 14 April 1877.</span>

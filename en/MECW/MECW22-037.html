<p>Sir,</p>
<p>In this morning's <i>Standard</i> your Paris correspondent translates from the <i>Gazette de France</i> a letter dated Berlin, April 28, 1871, and purporting to be signed by me. I beg to state that this letter is from beginning to end a forgery, quite as much as all the previous pretended letters of mine lately published in the <i>Paris-journal</i> and other French police papers. If the <i>Gazette de France</i> professes to have taken the letter from German papers, this must be a falsehood too. A German paper would never have dated that fabrication from Berlin.</p>
<p>I am, Sir, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>Karl Marx</p>
<p>London, July 13

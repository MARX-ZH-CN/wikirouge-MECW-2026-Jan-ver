ENGELS TO J. MOLESWORTH<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LESTER</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London, after 5 June 1872]</p>
<p>...<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> have every confidence in the character of Mr Glaser whom you will, I have no doubt, always find straightforward in all his dealings. As to his means I cannot give you any definite information but as I have the confidence in him that he would not order more than he was justified in doing, I should not hesitate to give him a moderate credit say a couple of £100—or even more. I think if you were to limit your credit at the beginning to £200—and then extend it afterwards as the business goes on and you get better acquainted with him, you would be pretty safe.</p>
<p>It is what I should do in your case.

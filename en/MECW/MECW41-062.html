MARX TO J. M. WEBER</p>
<p>IN BERLIN</p>
<p>London, 24 April 1860<br>9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, Haverstock Hill</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>I have the honour to enclose a retaining fee of 15 talers, at the same time advising you that I fully agree to all the measures adopted by you.</p>
<p>I remain, Sir,</p>
<p>Your Obedient Servant,</p>
<p>Dr Karl Marx</p>
<p><i>P. S.</i> As a result of investigations that I have started in Paris and Switzerland, notably in Geneva, I now have <i>proof (after</i> the proceedings I intend to publish it in pamphlet form) that Professor Karl Vogt is no more than a common French agent. I believe, by the by, that the annexation of Nice and Savoy will have opened the eyes of even the blindest of men to the 'Italian work of liberation',<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> the danger that is threatening Germany and the Tightness of those who <i>uttered timely warnings.</i>

Although in the course of the Austro-Italo-French war (see Note 46) France violated the agreement by making a separate truce with Austria in Villafranca on 11 July 1859, it did, nonetheless, obtain Nice and Savoy under the Turin treaty of 24 March 1860.</span>

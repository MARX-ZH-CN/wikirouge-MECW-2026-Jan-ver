ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY
<br>IN D E A L 5 9 4
<br>London, 26 July 1886
<br>Dear Baron,
<br>I have today sent you a <i>Volkszeitung</i> and shall tomorrow send off the one that arrived today; also <i>Deutsche Worte,</i> wherein the first in- stalment of an article on Gustav Cohn 5 9 5—so far quite delightful. You really must get hold of the chap<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> for the <i>Neue £eit.</i>
<br>Yesterday we were more or less on our own — Tussy was ill as well so that Aveling had to leave early — it's nothing much, but neverthe- less troublesome. On top ofthat it was raining cats and dogs — I hope you are having better weather down in the south-east where the cli- mate is more continental than anywhere else in England.
<br>So Dilke has providentially gone into political exile — <i>requiescat in pace!</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> That's what comes of protestant hypocrisy. None of this busi- ness could ever have happened in a Catholic country — either in Vienna or in Rome or in Paris — nor yet in Petersburg; such whited sepulchres are possible only in two centres — London and Berlin. In fact, if Berlin is becoming a metropolis, this is only because London is increasingly deteriorating into a Berlin. What could be more typical of Berlin than gallant Captain Forster escorting his lady-friend to a brothel? 396
<br>No other news to speak of—Schorlemmer has gone to Germany; I am getting better every day. Nim has just finished reading <i>Märtyrer der Phantasie</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> aloud (end has come!!) and is knitting stockings. Kind- est regards to you and your wife from us both.
<br>Your
<br>F.E.
<br>If there should be anything you want doing at home, I have once more reached the stage at which I can perfectly well walk as far as that, and hope this will continue; so if I can do you any service, don't hesitate to let me know.

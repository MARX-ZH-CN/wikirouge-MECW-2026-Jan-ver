ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 13 March 1868</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>For Meissner I still lack the letter from von Eynern. I wanted to prepare an advertisement<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>today but was disturbed.</p>
<p>Enclosed from Vienna.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>Have written to Wilhelmchen<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>for information. I think I shall accept in general, but say that the matter must remain secret 'in order not to disturb my other connections in the Viennese press'.</p>
<p>I also sent Wilhelm two articles about your book, completely popular for workers (so that even Wilhelm will understand them).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, I have coached him in his role in order to work over in the Reichstag the new code for crafts and manufactures (which also includes factory legislation).<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>This opportunity is very good in order to ADVERTISE the book, and I am convinced that this will also have a considerable effect, since even the official economists have to draw on it.</p>
<p>Since yesterday I have been fit for work again—on the one hand, I get back earlier in the evening, and, on the other, I have discovered that for 14 days I had been drinking beer poisoned probably with <i>cocculus indicus,</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>which totally narcotised me in the evening. I CHANGED THE TAP YESTERDAY—by chance—noted the differ- ence, and discovered the cause, which I had ascribed to digestive troubles.</p>
<p>H o w ABOUT CARBUNCLES?</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

<li id="cite_note-5"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-5">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Engels' letter to Liebknecht has not been found. From Liebknecht's reply of 29 March 1868 it follows that his friends and he readily took Engels' advice to use <i>Capital</i> as a basis for the proletarian stance vis-à-vis a new crafts and manufactures code that was being prepared (the same was recommended in his review of Volume One of <i>Capital</i> for the <i>Demokratisches Wochenblatt).</i> When, in the spring of 1869, the North German Reichstag began to discuss the code bill, August Bebel and other working-class deputies, following Engels' advice, resolutely criticised the bill and demanded that several amendments should be introduced into it that would meet the interests of the working class such as a ten-hour working day, the abolition of work on Sundays, the introduction of a factory inspectorate and the workers' right to coalitions. Although all these amendments were rejected by the bourgeois and Junker majority of the Reichstag, the speeches of the working-class deputies on this issue played an important part to unite the revolutionary efforts of the German proletariat.</span>

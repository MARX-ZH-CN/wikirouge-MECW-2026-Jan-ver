<blockquote>
<br>Preliminary draft resolutions were submitted by Marx to the Sub-Committee of the General Council (see Note 238) and approved by it on September 9, 1871. Later, the drafts were supplemented; in particular, clauses were added on the formation of working women's sections and on the general statistics of the working class. On September 12, after Engels' report, the resolutions were discussed and approved by the General Council. At the London Conference, Marx moved these resolutions on behalf of the General Council. Some of them were edited and subsequently included in the official publication of the Conference resolutions (see resolutions of the London Conference II, III, IV and X, in this volume, pp. 423, 424, 427).
<br>Engels' manuscript contains additions made by Marx.They were published in English for the first time in: The General Council of the First International. 1870-1871. Minutes, Moscow, 1967.

<br>1) That after the close of the Conference, no branch be acknowledged as belonging to the Association by the General Council and by the Central Councils of the various countries until its annual contribution of 1 d per head for the current year shall have been remitted to the General Council.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>2) a) For those countries in which the regular organization of the Association may for the moment become impossible by Government interference, the delegates of each Country are invited to propose such plans of organization as may be compatible with the peculiar circumstances of the Case, ß) The Association may be re-formed under other names, 7) but all secret organizations are formally excluded.
<br>3) The General Council will submit to the Conference a report of its administration of the affairs of the International since the last Congress.
<br>5) The General Council will propose to the Conference to discuss the propriety of issuing a reply, to the various governments which have prosecuted and are now prosecuting the International; the Conference to name a Committee to be charged with drawing up this reply after its close.
<br>4) Resolution of Congress of Basle to be inforced: That to avoid confusion the Central Councils of the various countries be instructed to designate themselves henceforth as Federal Councils with the name attached of the country they represent; and that the local branches or their Committees designate themselves as branches or Committees of their respective localities.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>6) <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> <br>7) That all delegates of the General Council appointed to distinct missions shall have the right to attend, and be heard at, all meetings of federal councils and local committees or branches, without however being thereby entitled to vote thereat.
<br>8) That the General Council be instructed to issue a fresh edition of the Statutes including the resolutions of the Congresses having relation thereto; and inasmuch as a mutilated French translation has hitherto been in circulation in France, and re-translated into Spanish and Italian, that it provide an authentic French translation which is to be forwarded to Spain and Italy also.

The Congress of Basle (1869) adopted a number of resolutions enhancing the leading role of the General Council, but it did not adopt a resolution on the designation of local branches of the International. Such a resolution was adopted at the London Conference (1871) and, after its approval by the General Council, included in the Administrative Regulations of the International Working Men's Association (see present edition, Vol. 23) without any reference to the Congress of Basle.</span>

ENGELS TO STANISLAW MENDELSON</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] Tuesday, 13 January 1891
122 Regent's Park Road, N.W.</p>
<p>Dear Citizen Mendelson,</p>
<p>Last Sunday,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>when we discussed the day and time at which it would be convenient for you to do me the pleasure of dining here, we were in such a hurry that, in order to avoid any misunderstanding, I had better repeat what I meant to say to you.</p>
<p>I take it that I may expect you, that is to say you, Mrs Mendelson and Citizen Jodko on Thursday, the day after tomorrow, at six o'clock. It is possible that I didn't express myself clearly enough in regard to the last named. If so, I would ask you to be so good as to request him again on my behalf to do me the honour of coming.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>My compliments, as also those of Mrs Kautsky, to Mrs Mendelson.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>F. Engels

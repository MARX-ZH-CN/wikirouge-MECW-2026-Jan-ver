ENGELS TO FRIEDRICH ADOLPH SORGE</p>
<p>IN HOBOKEN</p>
<p>London, 14 December 1872</p>
<p>Dear Sorge,</p>
<p>I confirm my letter of the 7th inst.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>and am sending today 1 copy of the <i>Emancipaciôn</i> with the article on Bakunin<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>containing information you too will not have had, and <i>The International Herald</i> with the Congress resolutions.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>That jackass Riley has left out the voting figures.</p>
<p>In Lodi, No. 118 of the <i>Plebe,</i> which contained your Address, has been confiscated and Bignami, the editor, has been arrested.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>It looks as though the Leipzig high treason trial<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>may be about to repeat itself there. We shall, of course, make as much capital as possible from the affair; it will appear at once in the <i>Volksstaat</i> and the <i>Emancipaciôn</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>as proof of whom the governments regard as the greater threat: the General Council and its adherents or the Alliancists. It is the best thing that could have happened to us in Italy.</p>
<p>You should have some brief reports on the meetings of the General Council printed in the <i>Oestliche Post</i> and in the American press, and send the relevant issues to the <i>Volksstaat, Egalité</i> and <i>The International Herald,</i> as well as one or two copies here, so that we can use them for Spain and Italy as well as for the French sections; the Danes and Dutch would also print them.</p>
<p>The letter of authority for Serraillier becomes more urgent every day.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>The Jurassians on one side and the Blanquists on the other, are burrowing away all over France and are <i>making progress</i> while Serraillier is already starting not to receive replies from various quarters anymore because he can only write as a private individual. If you continue to delay out of consideration for Dereure, who has been more than suspect since the resignation of the Blanquists,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup>or for any other reason, we shall lose the greater part of France and the tables will be turned on us at the next Congress. In haste.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

Prosecutor Gerli simultaneously announced that proceedings had been instituted against Enrico Bignami, the paper's editor. In December 1872 Bignami and three of his friends were arrested and charged with high treason and propagating the ideas of the International Working Men's Association.</span>

The trial was held in Leipzig between 11 and 26 March 1872.<br>Though the charges brought against them had not been proved, Bebel and Liebknecht were condemned to two-year imprisonment in a fortress (with the deduction of the two months they had spent in prison before the trial); Hepner was acquitted. Following the trial in Leipzig, early in July 1872 Bebel was again brought before the court 'for insulting His Majesty', which he had allegedly done when addressing workers in Leipzig. Bebel was sentenced to additional 9 months in prison and deprived of his seat in the Reichstag.</span>

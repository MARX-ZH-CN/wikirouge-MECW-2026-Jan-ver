ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[London,] 2 December 1885</p>
<p>Dear Kautsky,</p>
<p><i>Ad vocem</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> Adler:</p>
<p>1) Re the pistol business, don't forget to point out that the NCOs were wearing their <i>sabres.</i> They complained of an affront to the NCO caste.</p>
<p>2) Hess. It is not of course possible to confirm — for I never saw him again after May 1848, when he disappeared for good — whether or not he spent a few days in Baden or the Palatinate. But he didn't 'take part'; he was neither orator, nor journalist, nor official, nor soldier, so it's inconceivable that some government or other — Adler certainly ought to have said which one — should have condemned him to death.</p>
<p><i>Ad vocem</i> Liebknecht. Before you post the letter, give me a chance to enclose a word or two of explanation; there was something I forgot to tell him yesterday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F.E.

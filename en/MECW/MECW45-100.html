MARX TO MAX OPPENHEIM</p>
<p>IN PRAGUE</p>
<p>[Karlsbad,] 1 September 1876</p>
<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>I had never given up the idea of spending a day or two in Prague with my daughter, but did not wish to say anything about it in my letter to you, because I wanted to entice you here.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Mais les affaires sont les affaires;</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> perhaps on closer reflection you may find that a trip to Karlsbad might after all be of benefit to your health. I await your final decision on this score.</p>
<p>I wouldn't mind very much what the weather as such was like if it didn't to some extent clash with the conditions of the cure.</p>
<p>My daughter sends her warmest regards.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

Having completed it, he spent a few days with Max Oppenheim in Prague, and then, after brief visits to Kreuznach and Liège, returned to London on 22 September 1876.</span>

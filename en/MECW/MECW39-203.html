MARX TO ENGELS</p>
<p>IN MANCHESTER</p>
<p>[London,] 10 January 1854</p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Last evening Urquhart sent me from Newry (Ulster) a speech which I got my wife to copy out, then added a word or two at the beginning and the end, and thus produced an article.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>So I shall cancel yours this Friday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>Should there be any further INCIDENTS that belong here,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>perhaps you would be so good as to advise me of them by <i>Friday morning</i> so that I can give the stuff the finishing touches.</p>
<p>The whole family, from <i>a</i> to <i>us</i>, is still ill. The enclosed is from Cluss. I shall send you the other part of it next time, when I shall be writing at greater length.</p>
<p>That swine Tucker has just sent me a message. The first edition (50,000 COPIES) of 'Palmerston' is sold out. Now the gentleman sends word—he used not to be so condescending—that I should revise the thing for the second edition.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>Write at once and tell me what you advise me to do.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>K. M.

<li id="cite_note-4"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-4">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">About 16 December 1853 the London publisher Tucker published anonymously the pamphlet Palmerston and Russia in Tucker's Political Fly-Sheets, No. 1 (a reprint from the Glasgow Sentinel) (see Note 541). The pamphlet reproduced the article of the same title published in the New-York Daily Tribune on 4 November 1853, the second in this newspaper's publication of Lord Palmerston. The second edition of Palmerston and Russia, referred to here, was issued with Marx's participation in early February 1854. Marx made some amendments and additions on the basis of the People's Paper publication. On how the whole series of articles Lord Palmerston was written and published see this volume, Note 436, and present edition, Vol. 12</span>

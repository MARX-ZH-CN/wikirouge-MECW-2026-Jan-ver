<p>With a difference of at most 10 votes in favour of either Whigs or Tories, the elections here will produce the same old Parliament. The <i>cerclé vicieux</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> is complete. The same old constituents produce the same old Parliament. In that Parliament what have hitherto been the ruling parties are rotting from within, mutually offsetting and paralysing each other, so that they are compelled to appeal yet again to their constituents and so on, <i>ad infinitum</i>, until the circle is broken from without by the pressure of the masses, and that may soon be the case. At no previous election has the conflict between the real majority and the official majority of voters created by the electoral privileges been so glaringly in evidence. You should know that at every English election voting is done 1. by a <i>show of hands</i> when the whole population votes, and 2. by a <i>poll</i>, the decisive one, in which only the enfranchised vote. Those nominated by the <i>show of hands</i> do not include a single Member of Parliament, while those returned by the <i>poll</i> (i.e. really elected), do not include anyone nominated by the <i>show of hands</i>. Take Halifax, for example, where Wood, the Whig Minister (Finance) was opposing E. Jones. At the <i>show of hands</i>, Wood was hissed. Jones received 14,000 votes and was carried in triumph through the town. At the <i>poll</i>, Wood was elected while Jones received only 36 votes.</p>
<p>There is little new to report about émigré affairs. But for a few louts, Willich stands more and more isolated, no one believing in his probity any longer. As I have told you, Reichenbach, though he resigned from the committee long ago, <i>refuses</i> to hand out a <i>penny</i> from the loan until a definitive committee has been formed. In his eyes, Willich and Kinkel are as unacceptable as the handful of blackguards who elected them. Reichenbach est un honnête bourgeois, qui prend sa responsabilité au sérieux.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> </p>
<p>The French emigration has split into 3 camps: 1. Revolution (Ledru), 2. Delegation (the more progressive), 3. 1,500 opponents of both, the plebs or, as the aristocrats used to call them, the '<i>populeau</i>'. A certain Cœurderoy (<i>d'aileurs très bon républicain</i>)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> has published a pamphlet against Mazzini-Ledru and Cabet-Blanc and is shortly to bring out something else. You will receive both when they appear.</p>

<p>Yesterday a letter from Cologne, from which the following:</p>
<p>"Latterly they have been visiting various places in an attempt to find correspondence from you which, they are convinced, was to be conveyed through the agency of these persons to democrats in the Rhineland. Your friends are at last to be brought before the Court of Assizes. The bill of indictment, a most compendious work, has been drawn up, the date for the public hearing has been fixed for the 28th of this month, and the usual preliminaries are under way. As I</p>

<p>I have just read the bill of indictment which contains no less than 65-70 pages. If they're convicted, these people have only their own statements to blame. I doubt [there] can be any more consummate jackasses than these German working men: Reiff made some statements that were regular denunciations, and various others behaved no less ineptly. One sees what a dangerous business it is to establish connections with working men, when those connections are supposed to be kept secret. Small wonder that the fellows were so much harassed; the longer they were held in solitary confinement, the more satisfactory statements they made. That aside, facts don't come into it and, if the accused had not for the most part themselves talked so readily, there would be nothing whatever to go on. The bill of indictment will be taken in <i>contumaciam</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> against F. Freiligrath, at present in London. So Freiligrath will shortly be able to parade round London as a German poet who has been beheaded in effigy.</p>

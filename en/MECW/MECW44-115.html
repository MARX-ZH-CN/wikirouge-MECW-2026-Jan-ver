MARX TO THEODOR KOLL</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>[London,] 10 August [1871]
1 Maitland Park Road, Haverstock Hill, N.W.</p>
<p>Citizen Koll,</p>
<p>After I had received £4.1/6 from Lessner for the Pest tailors, I read in the German papers that the tailors' strike in Pest was over.</p>
<p>I therefore wrote <i>at once</i> to <i>Jakob Holländer</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> (at the address of <i>Johann Travnick,</i> etc., which is the address Holländer himself had given to the Workers' Society<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> ). In my letter [I] informed him that I had received £4.1/6 <i>to send to him</i> from the German Workers' Society, but that I had read in the German papers that the STRIKE was over, and therefore wanted to know— <i>if the news turned out to be true</i>—whether the Pest tailors would mind the money being put into the fund for the French refugees. I asked him for an <i>immediate</i> reply.</p>
<p>Since no answer came, on 27 June I paid the money into the refugee fund (as you can see from the enclosed receipt) in the name of the Workers' Society.</p>
<p>This was done <i>with the reservation</i> that <i>if the Pest workers, acting through their correspondent Holländer, should direct me to put the money to another use,</i> the £4.1/6 paid by me into the refugee fund in the name of the Workers' Educational Society should be regarded as a personal contribution from myself, and I would then send the money on to Pest on behalf of the Workers' Society.</p>
<p>However, no reply came from Pest and so I regarded the matter as settled.</p>
<p>In consequence of your letter I have now written to Bachruch</p>
<p>(a Hungarian worker in Paris) and asked him to find a safe way to write to Jakob Holländer in Pest and request him to reply to my letter at once.</p>
<p>I would ask you at the same time to announce <i>my resignation from the Society</i> to its members.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>Karl Marx

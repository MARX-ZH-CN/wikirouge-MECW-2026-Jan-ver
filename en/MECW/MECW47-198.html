ENGELS TO HERMANN SCHLÜTER</p>
<p>IN HOTTINGEN-ZURICH</p>
<p>London, 23 September 1885</p>
<p>Dear Mr Schlüter,</p>
<p>I. You will have received all the proofs of the <i>Dühring.</i><sup>20S</sup> They were sent off from here on the 13th and 14th. If anything is missing kindly let me know; the type-setting was such that there could be absolutely no question of its being printed unless corrected by me.</p>
<p>The last clean proof to arrive here was No. 14. I await the remainder for the list of printing errors. Enclosed a provisional list which corrects a great deal of nonsense, much of which I myself had doubtless allowed to stand. However I shall go through the whole thing once again.</p>
<p>Herewith also and at long last the preface<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>which caused me much toil and sweat. In the first place there were numerous interruptions. But then again my knowledge of natural science was very rusty and there was much I had to look up.</p>
<p>II. Please send me if possible (along with the preface) proofs (in duplicate) of <i>Marx vor den Geschwornen,</i><sup>a</sup> or at any rate clean proofs for the list of printing errors. The original edition is not devoid of bad errors; indeed, the worthy compositors sometimes exercise their minds more than the author would wish.</p>
<p>III. 'Preface',<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>etc., to the <i>Communist Trial</i><sup>b</sup> will follow this week provided there are no interruptions.</p>
<p>IV. Immediately after that I shall put Lupus'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>biography to rights for the <i>Schlesische Milliarde</i> as well as anything else appertaining to it. This will follow in a few days.</p>
<p>Please send me clean proofs of everything as well as proofs of my prefaces, etc. Also 12 copies of each of the above.</p>
<p>I am also seeing to Marx's photograph. Then I shall get on with re-writing the <i>Peasant War</i><sup>2</sup> ' 3 as soon as I have got the revision of the French 4 4 4 and English translations<sup>6</sup> off my back.</p>
<p>Now that I am back home<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>the correction of proofs will be attended to speedily and punctually.</p>
<p>I have had a good few bones to pick with Mr Meissner about the get-up of the 2nd volume of <i>Capital.</i> In the preface and text the type is all jumbled up, although I had already gone a long way towards sorting this out in the proofs, so far as it was possible to do so. No excuse for that. Moreover, there are 500 copies with no index at all. I enclose one copy for the archives.</p>
<p>D f is incorrigible.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>His appeal to his papa is touching<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>; the old man will take a stick to him.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>With best wishes,</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>F. Engels</p>

The congress was to work out the German Social Democrats' political line on the social reforms being carried out by the bourgeois government, to decide on the party's tactics and the position to be taken by <i>Der Sozialdemokrat,</i> its printed organ, given the Anti-Socialist Law in Germany (see Note 37). The congress unanimously called on the party to expose the demagogy of Bismarck's domestic policy, endorsed the stance of the main printed organ and the general line of conduct of the parliamentary group (see Note 49). It further made it incumbent on every party member, including the Social-Democratic representatives in the Reichstag, to observe party discipline and help carry out party decisions (see also Note 16).</span>

Engels is referring to Viereck's speech on 8 August at a workers' meeting in Munich in which he said that the emperor would give the workers much more if he knew how poorly they lived. The Munich Social Democrats protested at Viereck's speech (see <i>Der Sozialdemokrat,</i> No. 34, 20 August 1885). In his reply, published in the Munich-based <i>Deutsches Wochenblatt,</i> No. 30, 30 August and <i>Der Sozialdemokrat,</i> No. 36, 3 September 1885, Viereck, to all intents and purposes, supported Bismarck's social reform (see Note 312).</span>

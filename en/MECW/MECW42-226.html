MARX TO ENGELS
<br>IN MANCHESTER
<br>[London,] 3 JUNE 1867
<br>DEAR FRED,
<br>T h e reason why sheets 10 and 11 are not being sent to you, indeed why no more proofs<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> at all, you will discover from the enclosed note from Wigand. On the other hand, you will receive the first 5 pulls that have been sent to me. You can keep them ABOUT 8-10 days, but then you must let me know exactly <i>which points</i> in the exposition of the <i>form of value</i> you think should be specially popularised for the philistines in the supplement.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>Fenians ordered. 4 3 9 Other commissions will be executed BY AND BY. See the <i>Hermann</i> of last week. It is now the private herald of Mr Freiligrath, who is reporting on the PROGRESS OE THE SUBSCRIFHON here each week via Juch.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> Little Jenny says that if her father ever did such a thing, she would publicly proclaim him her non-father. Whereupon Lafargue asked her: <i>Mais qu'est-ce que votre mère dirait là-dessus?</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> T h e noble poet<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> is incidentally sly enough to declare already that he will <i>have</i> to remain in London on account of his resp. part in the Shakespeare translation. Ferdinand and Ida,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> Ida and Ferdinand, A WELL-ASSORTED COUPLE, THOSE TWO!
<br>Apropos. When Gumpert asked me which hospital Lafargue was at, I said St Thomas's. I was, however, mistaken. He is at <i>Bartholomew's</i> Hospital and asks for the ERROR to be corrected. Please do not forget to supply a photogramm of yourself and Lupus.
<br>MY BEST COMPLIMENTS TO MRS Lizzy,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> Moore and Chlormayer.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> <br><i>Salut.</i>
<br>Your
<br>K. M.
<br>I was exceedingly pleased to read in the Paris correspondence of <i>The Times</i> that the Parisians chanted their support for the Poles to Alexander's <i>face,</i> etc.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> Mr Proudhon and his little doctrinaire clique are not the FRENCH PEOPLE.

Marx wanted to supplement and specify Chapter I of the main text on commodities and money. He implemented this idea in the first edition of Volume One (1867). In the second German edition of 1872 Marx revised this appendix and incorporated it in the relevant passages of the text. In the subsequent editions of<i> Capital,</i> including the English one of 1887 edited by Engels, the text was given in this form.</span>

The poet's admirers wanted to present him with a 'people's donation' since he had lost his post of manager in the English branch of the Bank of Switzerland after the latter's bankruptcy. With this aim in view, committees were organised in Britain, Germany and the United States through which funds were gathered. Reports about the subscription were regularly published in the London newspaper<i> Hermann.</i></span>

At the meeting of 18 June 1867 the General Council of the First International passed a resolution approving the mass demonstration of solidarity in Paris with the Poles suppressed by Tsarism. The text of the,Council's resolution was published in<i> The Commonwealth,</i> No. 224 of 22 June 1867 (see<i> The General  Council of the First International. 1866-1868. Minutes,</i> Moscow, 1974, pp. 129-30).</span>

ENGELS TO HERMANN SCHLÜTER
<br>IN HOTTINGEN-ZURICH
<br>London, 7 December 1887
<br>Dear Mr Schlüter,
<br>It would be best if you were to make up a volume of <i>Shorter Papers, 1871-75</i> by F. Engels, as follows:
<br>1. Article on Vogt, 1871, No. 38, 10 May<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> <br>2. <i>Refugee Literature</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> <br>3. Tkachov's letter 4. [On] <i>Social Relations in Russia 5. The Bakuninists at Work</i>
<br>We shall have to omit the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> article<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> for in the first place it would today require an additional explanatory section (because of our Russian friends) and, in the second, I intend at some later date to bring out a collection of the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> articles by Marx and myself. We might discuss this later on.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> <br>Herewith <i>The Bakuninists at Work</i> with the paragraphs in Section III correctly numbered in the order in which they should appear. Would you kindly send <i>this sheet</i> for me to look at, so that I know what I'm about. The remaining proof reading can be attended to over there.
<br>If you could get hold of one or two copies of the <i>Revue</i> of the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> (complete), I will gladly pay for them. I have only got vols 3, 5 and 6, and should like to have 1, 2 and 4 as well.
<br>You shall have the 'Mordspatrioten'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> shortly: I am writing the introduction. I shall also try and put the 'Force Theory' to rights.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> <br>As regards other matters, 1. <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> articles, see above; 2. <i>Revue</i> of the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i>—nothing that could do without an introduction and wouldn't be time-consuming; 3.1 have sold the <i>Prussian Military Question</i> to Meissner, with whom I cannot start a row, and much of what I say in it would be very difficult to understand today without a commentary.
<br>After the New Year I shall have to tackle Volume III of <i>Das Kapital,</i> for which I must spare my eyes. Aside from what I have already undertaken, therefore, I can at present do absolutely nothing for you; I'm very sorry, but I have no alternative. As soon as this ms. has gone to press, and while correcting the proofs, I shall have time to spare for you, provided my eyes are all right again. But you must remember that I can only really write for a few hours each day and then only by daylight—often not to be had for love or money over here—and withal a vast correspondence!
<br>With kindest regards,
<br>Your
<br>F. Engels

Friedrich Hermann Schlüter also suggested that Engels include in the collection some of his articles from Die Neue Rheinische Zeitung, Die Neue Rheinische Zeitung. Politisch-Ökonomische Revue, as well as excerpts from his pamphlet The Prussian Military Question and the German Workers' Party.</span>

<li id="cite_note-6"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-6">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Engels replies to F. Schlüter's suggestion to revise three chapters from the second part of Anti-Dühring and have them published as a separate pamphlet. These chapters, under the single title The Theory of Force contained an explanation of materialist views on economics and politics. Engels subsequently changed his plan and decided also to add a fourth chapter on Germany history from 1848 to 1888 and a critique of Bismarck. The proposed title of the pamphlet was The Role of Force in History. Engels wrote this (fourth) chapter somewhat later, at the close of 1887 and in thirst three months of 1888. Having interrupted his work in March 1888, Engels must have never resumed it. This unfinished work of his, an outline of the preface to the pamphlet, the plan of the fourth chapter, as well as the plan of the concluding part of this chapter (this plan delineated the contents of the unfinished part of the work) are published in the present edition, Vol. 26.</span>

<p><i>Cologne,</i> May 1. Deputies who arrived here yesterday from Berlin report that <i>the Chambers have been dissolved in Dresden as well</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Hanover, Berlin, Dresden — in Munich there has so far only been an adjournment — do you, honest German citizen, now realise what tune is to be played?</p>
<p>Last year, when the Frankfurt Assembly was convened, Prussia ordered all the small states to <i>convene</i> their Chambers. Now, exactly one year later, Prussia orders them to <i>dissolve</i> all the Chambers. Then it was Camphausen, now it is Manteuffel. On each occasion there was the same aim, the same intention. Despite all the phrases, Camphausen and Manteuffel go arm in arm.</p>
<p>And there are still people in Germany who defend the sovereigns!

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">The dissolution of the Second Chamber in Prussia on April 27, 1849 was followed by the dissolution of the corresponding chambers in Hanover and Saxony because, the ruling circles of these states refused to recognise the imperial Constitution approved by the majority of deputies. In Saxony the Provincial Diet was dissolved by order of King Frederick Augustus II as early as April 28, 1849. This act and the Government's other counter-revolutionary measures sparked off the uprising in Dresden on May 3. It started the armed struggle for the imperial Constitution in a number of regions in Germany</span>

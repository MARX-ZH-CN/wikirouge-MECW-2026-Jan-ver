ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 4 January 1866<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>£10 encl. in 2 Bank-of-England notes. How stands it with bill of exchange for LANDLORD? Tell me how much and date when due, so that I may make my dispositions.</p>
<p>That malicious compilation of <i>Social-Demokrat</i> garbage in the Schulze-Delitzschite pamphlet<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> had already been sent me anonym- ously from Berlin; it is always a good thing to have such a résumé with extracts. Schulze-Delitzsch has also announced that in the next few days he is to publish a reply to Lassalle, in which he is going to demolish him. 72</p>
<p>You will already know as well that Racowija died of consump- tion, so presumably Mamsell Dönniges is once more IN THE MARKET, IF</p>
<p>EVER SHE WAS FAIRLY OUT OF IT.</p>
<p>Mr Held's speech has also been sent me from Berlin. He's a real Berlin scoundrel.</p>
<p>Monsieur Bonaparte's progress is most decidedly that of the crab. The trouble in the army over Mexico<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> is very serious, and so is the student trouble in Paris.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> It is very important that the Paris students should take the side of the proletariat, confused though their ideas on the subject may be. The École polytechnique will follow soon enough. It would be so splendid if the rascal lived to see his own DOWNFALL, and it now almost appears that he might. It is getting more and more rotten for Bismarck every day, too, and, if those scoundrels in Cologne had not got him out of the soup, it would probably already have been all up with him now.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>I am agog for the next parliament, the disintegration of the old parties must surely proceed apace now. JOHN BRIGHT IS EVIDENTLY BIDDING FOR OFFICE—it is true, I have not yet read the speech he gave yesterday.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Have you read Tyndall's 'HEAT CONSIDERED AS A MODE OF MOTION'? If not, you should d o so. A great deal of work has been done in this field, and the matter appears to be assuming a rational shape; the atom theory is being taken to such extremes that it must soon fall apart.</p>
<p>Please don't forget to send me <i>The Workman's Advocate</i> and <i>The Free Press.</i></p>
<p>Regards and best wishes to your family for the New Year.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

The invaders also intended to use Mexican territory as a spring-board for intervening in the US Civil War on the side of the slaveholding Southern States. In the summer of 1863 the French occupied the city of Mexico (Britain and Spain recalled their troops in April 1862 because of contradictions with France) and declared Mexico an empire with Napoleon Ill's henchman, the Archduke of Austria Maximilian, at its head. However, the Mexican people put up a stubborn resistance to the French colonialists and inflicted a heavy defeat on them. In March 1867 they were compelled to withdraw.</span>

They were caused by the decision of the Paris Academy Council to expel students who took part in the International Students' Congress held in Liège (Belgium) at the end of October 1865. The congress was attended by students from many European countries, the most numerous delegation being from France (Paul Lafargue, Charles Longuet, Charles Victor Jaclard, and others). Most speakers at the congress expressed the revolutionary students' protest against the regime of the Second Empire.</span>

<li id="cite_note-5"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-5">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">On 18 July 1865 an agreement was concluded between the Bismarck government and the Board of the Cologne-Minden Railway Joint-Stock Company. It granted the Company's Board the right to buy up its shares which until then belonged to the government alone. This deal placed a considerable sum of money at the disposal of the Bismarck government. The agreement was to be ratified by the Prussian Provincial Diet, but on 28 August the shareholders' general meeting unanimously approved it without the Diet's ratification.</span>

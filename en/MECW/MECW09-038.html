<p>According to letters of the 6th of March from the Moldavian border, the Russians stationed in Transylvania have not merely been reinforced by 8,000 men, but another Russian corps is standing on the border of the Bukovina, awaiting the order to move into the Bukovina. <i>Bem has assembled considerable reinforcements and is threatening Hermannstadt for the third time</i>. Malkowsky's corps (commanded by Urban) has had to <i>retreat</i> to the border of the Bukovina, and <i>once again to surrender the town of Bistritz to the Hungarians</i>.

MARX TO WILLIAM JESSUP</p>
<p>IN NEW YORK</p>
<p>London, 28 October 1868</p>
<p>1 Modena Villas, Maitland Park,<br>
Haverstock Hill</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Your letter to Mr Eccarius, d.d. 3 curt, has been duly communicated by him to the General Council of the International Working Men's Association. He has been reappointed as our corresponding Secretary for America, but is at present too ill to fulfil his functions.</p>
<p>The General Council has appointed Mr S. Meyer and Mr August Vogt as its German-American correspondents and Mr Pelletier as its French-American correspondent. I beg to recommend you these citizens.</p>
<p>The General Council being itself yearly elected by the General Congress, it is self-understood that all its nominations can only be valid for the current year, if they be not renewed.</p>
<p>Yours fraternally<br>
Karl Marx</p>

<p>Wm. J. Jessup, Corresponding Representative for State of New York, National Labour Union,</p>

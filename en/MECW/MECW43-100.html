MARX TO SIGFRID MEYER AND AUGUST VOGT</p>
<p>IN NEW YORK</p>
<p>London, 28 October 1868</p>
<p>Dear Meyer and Vogt,</p>
<p>The enclosed credentials for Meyer (I have added the same for you)<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> will show you that your wish had already been met by 13 October. Meyer's appointment was printed in <i>The Bee-Hive</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> on 3 October.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> The GENERAL COUNCIL has resolved that the German correspondents shall correspond with me, Pelletier (for the French) with Dupont, and Eccarius with Jessup. I myself suggested the latter, as I have no time for more correspondence. You can hand the enclosed lines to Jessup<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> and, at the same time, show him your credentials.</p>
<p>With regard to Eccarius there is some misunderstanding. <i>I</i> have <i>never</i> quarrelled with him; on the contrary I have supported him <i>to this day</i> against the ATTACKS by the English, etc.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup> But <i>he</i>—his preponderant and often narrow-minded egoism perhaps developed as a result of his circumstances—commits unpleasant tomfooleries from time to time. I generally take no notice of this. Now and then my patience is exhausted. I give him a brain washing, and ALL is RIGHT AGAIN for the time being. The poor devil is, at present, very ill, and he always utilises such moments to say his <i>pater peccavi.</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup> To what Liebknecht is referring, according to Vogt's letter, I have absolutely no idea. <i>I,</i> <i>at least,</i> have never written a word to anybody <i>against</i> Eccarius EXCEPT in my letter to Meyer, at a moment when I was upset by letters from our other delegates to the Brussels Congress in which they denounced Eccarius.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup> But it is quite possible that Eccarius wrote to Liebknecht without my knowledge in such a way that moved the latter to make his remarks to Vogt. This would be peculiar, since just at that time I had a big dispute with the English about and <i>for</i> Eccarius.</p>
<p>As far as <i>Sorge</i><sup>h</sup> is concerned, no further action. My lines to Jessup explain the TEMPORARY character of the credentials.</p>
<p><i>Cards for members</i> are no longer available, must be reprinted. Liebknecht is dabbling too much in south German patriotism, and he should not print such nonsense about 'state and society'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> containing the exact opposite of our opinions. <i>Salut.</i> In all haste.</p>
<p>Yours</p>
<p>K. Marx</p>
<p>Apropos. Do you know Dietzgen? He has now returned from Petersburg to the Rhine to establish himself as a small tanner. He is one of the most gifted workers I know, I mean by correspondence. I don't know him personally.</p>
<p>A translation of my book is now appearing in Russian in St. Petersburg.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> Or did I already inform you of this?</p>

<li id="cite_note-9"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-9">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Marx is referring to a letter written to him by Nikolai Danielson on 30 (18) September 1868, with a postscript by Nikolai Lyubavin dated 14 (2) October. Danielson wrote: 'The significance of your latest work—<i>Capital. Critique of Political Economy</i>—has prompted one of local publishers (N. Polyakov) to undertake its translation into Russian. The various attendant circumstances make it desirable to publish the second volume simultaneously with the first. Therefore, as the publisher's representative, I request you, should you consider it possible, to send me sheets of the second volume as soon as they have been published.'
In his reply, Marx enclosed a note on his own literary and political activities, which was used in the preface to<i> Capital's</i> Russian edition (see this volume, pp. 123-25 and Note 196).</span>

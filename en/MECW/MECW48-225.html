<br>TO O. A. ELLISSEN IN EINBECK
<br>London, 22 October 1889<br>
122 Regent's Park Road, N. W.
<br>Dear Sir,
<br>In reply to your circular<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I regret to inform you that as the papers in my possession have not been sorted for the past 20 years, I cannot possibly search out F. A. Lange's letters—there are only a few—from the pile until I have 3 or 4 weeks' spare time in which to put the whole lot in order. As soon as I have finished the final editing of Volume III of Marx's <i>Capital</i>—some time early next year—I must address myself to this task, for it admits of no further delay, whereupon I shall be glad to place the aforementioned letters at your disposal.
<br>You may, of course, publish my letters to Lange in full or in part depending on the circumstances, but in the latter case I would ask you to be good enough to <i>ensure</i> that the passages concerned <i>appear in their full context.</i>
<br>Yours faithfully,
<br>Fr. Engels

Ellissen, who intended to write a book about Friedrich Lange, had found Engels' letters in his personal archives. He therefore asked Engels to give him Lange's letters (addressed to Engels) and allow him to use their correspondence in his book. Engels made the following marginal notes on Ellissen's letter, 'The letters are out of order and cannot be made available before the completion, next spring, of Vol. Ill; then they will be at your disposal. They may be reproduced in full or in part - in the latter case I beg you to give the respective excerpts in their total context'. Einbeck, Okt. 89. Dr O. A. Ellissen wegen Langes Briefe.</span>

MARX TO MORITZ ELSNER
<br>IN BRESLAU
<br>[London,] 17 April 1855 
<br>28 Dean Street, Soho
<br>Dear Eisner,
<br>I shall be away from London for a few days in company with my wife. Dronke has kindly agreed to carry on with the articles during that time. He will today be sending you a report on Bonaparte's arrival.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> In case I don't see him again, I am writing to you separately.
<br>The 2 enclosed articles<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> constitute the <i>beginning</i> of a polemic against <i>pan-Slavism</i>.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> In my view it is high time that Germany be made seriously aware of the dangers threatening her. You may print these things <i>when</i> you think fit, for they have nothing directly to do with our regular articles. However I'm convinced that there is <i>no time</i> to lose. The alarm must be sounded in Germany.
<br>In the same context the Berlin 'Critical Criticism'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup> will be lambasted for its arrogant stupidity.
<br>Your
<br>K. M.

<li id="cite_note-3"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-3">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Engels planned to write a critique of pan-Slavist ideas. Ever since his removal to Manchester in 1850 Engels had been studying the language, literature and history of the Slav peoples. As can be judged from Marx' letters to Engels of 16 May and 26 June 1855, Marx negotiated the publication of Engels' pamphlet in Germany (see this volume, pp. 535 and 539). But these plans of Marx and Engels remained unfulfilled. In April 1855 at Marx's request Engels wrote two articles on this subject under the title 'Germany and Pan-Slavism' (see present edition, Vol. 14, pp. 156-62). They were published in the Neue Oder-Zeitung and under changed titles in the New-York Daily Tribune (see Note 649)</span>

<li id="cite_note-4"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-4">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Engels describes here the reaction of the European Press to Louis Bonaparte's policy of unrestrained social demagogy on the one hand and increased personal power on the other after the coup d'état of 2 December 1851. On 1 January 1852, a solemn service in honour of the President for which 190,000 francs were assigned was held in Notre Dame de Paris; the eagles on state banners (symbol of Napoleon's Empire) were restored. The Prince President moved to the royal palace of the Tuileries, where on 14 January a new Constitution was proclaimed under which all power was concentrated in the hands of the head of the State elected for a term of 10 years, the composition and legislative functions of all the higher state institutions were also placed under his control. A detailed analysis of the methods and essence of the demagogic policy pursued by Bonaparte in the social sphere and of repressions against the democratic and working-class movements is given in Marx's Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (present edition, Vol. 11)</span>

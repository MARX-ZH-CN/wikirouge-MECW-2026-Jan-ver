ENGELS TO HERMANN ENGELS</p>
<p>IN BARMEN</p>
<p>Ryde, Isle of Wight, 28 July 1892 The Firs, Brading Road</p>
<p>Dear Hermann,</p>
<p>Very many thanks for your letters. I'm sorry that my plans should have clashed to some extent with yours, but because of other arrangements I was more or less tied to a fixed date and could not very well upset these so long as there was no positive word from you. Everything is now in order and, unless I advise you to the contrary, I shall arrive on the 12th (probably by the first train from Cologne) and shall in any case telegraph from there.</p>
<p>I have been here since yesterday and intend to stay until the 9th, or at any rate the 8th, of August.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> The weather is magnificent, cloud- less sky, temperature 16-17 Reaumur, a fresh easterly wind, flowers and beautiful trees outside my window, wonderful air, barely a kilo- metre from the sea though nearly 200 ft above it, and with hills and coppices all around.</p>
<p>So here's to our meeting. Meanwhile my love to Emma<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> and the children.</p>
<p>Your old</p>
<p>Friedrich

ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN ZALT-BOMMEL</p>
<p>Manchester, 3 January 1864</p>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>The many CHRISTMAS drinking-sprees and consequent GENERAL UNFITNESS FOR BUSINESS have rendered me utterly incapable of replying any sooner. However, the affair is now happily over.</p>
<p>I am sending your wife the amount in question<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>For the rest, I'm delighted to hear that your second carbuncle has been operated on, and that you are thus over this latter crisis. You'll have got damned thin as a result of this tedious business.</p>
<p>The Schleswig-Holstein affair has come off the rails again good and proper. If, as I believe, there's war in the spring, we shall have Denmark, Sweden, France and Italy against us and, possibly, England. In Hungary and Poland Plonplonism,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>to which Kossuth had already pointed the way, is in full swing.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>I see only two ways out here: 1. either revolution in Berlin as soon as the troops have left and, in Vienna, a corresponding movement with concessions of an adequate kind to Hungary and, perhaps, also to Poland. That's what would be most favourable, and there would be nothing to fear in such a case. But it is also what is most improbable, in view of the confusion that prevails. Or, alternative- ly, 2. a restoration of the Holy Alliance<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>for which, as always, the partition of Poland would provide the cement (Russia has a greater interest in Poland than in Denmark and also the prospect, come the armistice, of having Austria and Prussia under her thumb, i.e. being able to impose her own conditions).</p>
<p>Then the Russians would take over from the Prussians in Berlin and play the policeman, whereat we would be done for, and Bonaparte cock of the walk.</p>
<p>The mock war in Schleswig under Wrangel can't last very long.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup>In the first place, the Danish fortifications will make even tlie initial encounters too bloody and, in the second, Boustrapa 167</p>
<p>is too much in need of a popular war not to seize this opportunity. What more could he ask than the restoration of the Holy Alliance and a war for both Poland and the Rhine with, for good measure, England and Italy and all the small states of Europe on his side?</p>
<p>Apropos. Our worthy Faucher, who shows himself a rabid Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg man in the Chamber,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>is, at the same time, sending <i>The Manchester Guardian</i> anti-German articles in which he arse-licks to the English bastards of <i>The Times.</i> Shouldn't one do something to unmask this louse?</p>
<p>If the curs in the Prussian Chamber were now to take their courage in both hands, they could straighten things out to their own satisfaction within the space of 6 weeks. Handsome William's reply shows what a fix the government is in.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup>No one will fork out, not even the worthy von der Heydt, and they know they won't get any money <sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lupus has just come to pick me up and sends you his kindest regards.</p>
<p>Here's to a good recovery and a Happy New Year.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

Plon-Plon took an equally demagogic stand on the national liberation struggle of the Hungarian, Italian and Polish peoples and acted, in effect, as a vehicle of Napoleon Ill's foreign policy, recruiting supporters for it among bourgeois and petty-bourgeois democratic émigrés.</span>

The latter motion was proposed by Prussia and Austria, who wanted no open violation of the 1852 London Protocol (see Note 380). Under pressure from Austria and Prussia, their proposal was adopted, and by 31 December Saxon and Hanover troops had occupied the whole of Holstein, meeting with no resistance from the Danes. Friedrich of Augustenburg was proclaimed Duke of Schleswig and Holstein under the name of Frederick VIII (see Note 558).</span>

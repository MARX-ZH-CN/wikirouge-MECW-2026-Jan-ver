<p>Chairman [Unsigned]<br><i>J. George Eccarius,</i> Secretary
</p>
<h4 class="mw-headline" id="ME21-4-3">Council Meeting February 11</h4>
<p>The Minutes are in Eccarius's hand on pp. 130-31 of the Minute Book]</p>
<p>Citizen Shaw in the chair.</p>
<p>The Minutes of the two last meetings were read and confirmed.
</p>
<h5 class="mw-headline" id="ME21-4-4">Correspondence</h5>
<p>Citizen Jung read a letter from Geneva stating that the strike was over not altogether to the satisfaction of the men, but considering the unfavourable season they might have fared worse. The letter from London had not given much encouragement, but they thanked the Council for the steps that [had] been taken. Almost all the trades societies had now joined, and newspapers had been established in several places. They would soon send money.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Belgium. The members hold. numerous meetings about co-operation, universal suffrage, and to organise opposition to the law of conscription and agitate for the abolition of the standing army. New sections have been established at Liege, Verviers, and amongst the miners of Borinage. The finances are in an unsatisfactory state; they have much expense, but have no doubt that they will be able to pay their contribution. They have also received a letter from Guillaume of Locle announcing that the compte rendu is at last ready, but will cost two francs.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>France. Citizen Dupont read a letter stating that the inquiry before the juge d'instruction was not yet ended. There had been but four domiciliary visits, this was not enough for the prosecution,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup> so the police had summoned all the members of the Committee, including one who had never accepted and never attended. The judge was of opinion that English names on the Council list of the I.W.A. were men of straw, that it was only the revolutionary refugees who gave instructions to their friends how to act. It was a secret society with a public platform. The Paris members sought to obtain the control over the French workmen for revolutionary purposes. Rothschild has received notice to quit. In default of any punishable offence the accused expect to be punished for their sentiments.</p>
<p>The Marseilles branch consists of 280 members.</p>
<p>Citizen <i>Jung</i> was instructed to send the translations of the circulars to Switzerland and to instruct the German Secretary of Geneva [Becker] to get them published in as many papers as he could.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>It was further agreed that Citizen Dupont have the questions on the circular and some Congress resolutions printed for transmission to France.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Citizen <i>Lawrence</i> gave notice that on that day fortnight he would move some resolutions respecting credit institutions for the working class.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" id="cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Council then adjourned to Tuesday, February 18.</p>
<p>Members present: Dupont, Eccarius, Huleck, Mrs. Huleck, Hales, Jung, Lessner, Lawrence, Neal, Maurice, Shaw.</p>

</p>
<h4 class="mw-headline" id="ME21-4-5">Council Meeting February 18</h4>
<p>[The Minutes are in Eccarius's hand on p. 132 of the Minute Book]</p>
<p>Citizen <i>Shaw</i> in the chair.</p>
<p>The Minutes of the previous meeting were read and confirmed.
</p>
<h5 class="mw-headline" id="ME21-4-6">Correspondence</h5>
<p>The Chaux-de-Fonds section has formed co-operative stores under the title of <i>La Prevoyante</i> and asks for the addresses of British manufacturers of shirtings, muslins, and other stuffs for women's dresses, and Coullery adds that we should send patterns. All purchases made with ready money. Coullery wants to know whether London is asleep.</p>
<p>The Secretary [Eccarius] was instructed to communicate the substance of the letter to Rochdale Pioneers' Co-operative Society.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" id="cite_ref-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Belgium. The government wants 2,000 more soldiers and requires several millions for war purposes; the section has protested.</p>
<p>It was agreed that Maurice be paid £1 on account of rent.</p>
<p>Nomination. Mrs. Morgan nominated by Citizen <i>Shaw,</i> seconded by Citizen <i>Huleck.</i></p>
<p>Citizen Williamsen, by Citizen <i>Huleck,</i> seconded by Citizen <i>Morgan.</i></p>
<p>On account of the tailors' general meeting<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8" id="cite_ref-8">[8]</a></sup> the Council adjourned to Wednesday, February 26.</p>
<p>Members present: Buckley, Dupont, Eccarius, Jung, Mrs. Huleck, Huleck, Maurice, Morgan, Lawrence, Neal, Shaw.</p>
<p>[Unsigned]
</p>
<h4 class="mw-headline" id="ME21-4-7">Council Meeting February 26</h4>
<p>[The Minutes are in Eccarius's hand on pp. 132-33 of the Minute Book]</p>
<p>Citizen Shaw in the chair.</p>
<p>The Minutes of the previous meeting were read and confirmed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Morgan and Citizen Williamsen were admitted as members without a dissentient.</p>
<p>Citizen <i>Milner</i> presented credentials as delegate of the National Reform League and paid 2s. 6d. as the second half of the annual contribution for 1867. The delegate was admitted by unanimous vote.
</p>
<h5 class="mw-headline" id="ME21-4-8">Correspondence</h5>
<p>A letter [was read] from the West End boot-closers, answering the questions<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9" id="cite_ref-9">[9]</a></sup> and offering to pay the first quarter's contribution, but it must be fetched.</p>
<p>Mr. P. Shorrocks writes from Manchester that the workpeople in that town have little faith in London, but he will endeavour to get adhesion to the International and information for the report.
</p>
<h5 class="mw-headline" id="ME21-4-9">Report of Deputations</h5>
<p>Citizen <i>Huleck</i> had an interview with the N. W. branch of the boot-makers, but the meeting was not numerous enough to decide the question of affiliation. Has no doubt they will join.</p>
<p>Citizen <i>Jung</i> was well received by the City Women's Men. They joined, are 400 strong, and will send a delegate.</p>
<p>Citizen <i>Lawrence</i> had received a letter from the Corresponding Secretary of the International Tailors' Union of America, in which the readiness is announced to enter into a tailors' union extending throughout the world; the London tailors on the previous night had endorsed the sentiment and instructed their secretary to continue the correspondence;<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10" id="cite_ref-10">[10]</a></sup> and Citizen Lawrence thinks if the most important passages of that letter be made known on the Continent it may induce other trades to follow.</p>
<p>Citizen <i>Jung</i> desires to hear the letter before any action is taken.</p>
<p>Citizen <i>Lawrence</i> gives notice that we call the attention of the Council to the subject at the next meeting.</p>
<p>The American Secretary [Shaw] was instructed to write to Mr. Jessup at New York with a view to obtain information for the report.</p>
<p>The Council adjourned at 10:30.</p>
<p>Members present: Eccarius, Huleck, Mrs. Huleck, Jung, Lessner, Lawrence, Milner, Mrs. Morgan, Morgan, Maurice, Shaw.</p>

In the report of this meeting published in <i>The Bee-Hive</i> No. 331, February 15, 1868, this information from Paris is given as follows:<br>"The inquiry into the conduct of the members of the Paris Committee is still going on. M. Gonet, the juge d'instruction, does not know what to make of it. He is morally certain that the accused are no friends of the present regime, nor much in favour of the existing state of things generally, but the domiciliary visits, made at six o'clock one morning between Christmas and <i>New</i> Year's day, have, instead of Fenian plots and plans, only yielded a few French copies of an address that has freely circulated, in different languages, for more than three years throughout the civilised world; and some letters from London containing strong expressions of opinions on various subjects. M. Gonet has come to the conclusion that there must be something behind the screen that the vigilance of the imperial spies cannot lay hold of. He maintains that the International Working Men's Association in France is only a device to deceive the authorities, that n ames on the London Council are men of straw, the English am and that it is only the French revolutionists in London with whom the Paris sympathisers are in correspondence, and from whom they receive the secret instructions which the police cannot get at. In default of incriminating documents and indictable offences the men expect to be punished for their sentiments, and for what the imperial authorities may consider them capable of, if they had a chance of doing it."</span>

To make co-operative production successful the working classes must have banks of their own. At the very lowest estimate, the working class had £15,000,000 sterling in the banks, which a: present was used by the wealthy for a nominal interest, and was in reality used against the working class."</span>

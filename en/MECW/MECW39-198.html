<p><i>To Engels in Manchester</i></p>
<p><b>[London,] 23 November 1853, 28 Dean Street, Soho</b></p>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p><em>The People's Paper</em> had been overlooked. Enclosed herewith. The five articles that have so far appeared in Jones' paper have been compressed in the <em>Tribune</em> into three.</p>
<p>Whatever calls there may be on your time, I must ask you to let me have for <em>Friday</em> at least 2 of (your usual) pages — more is unnecessary — written in English so that I waste no time over translation. It seems to me that the campaign is now over for the winter; and in any case the first phase has been concluded, and hence can be disposed of with a few general remarks. So I count on at least 2 pages.</p>
<p>The Willich mess calls for speed — in direct contrast to his six months of shillyshallying.</p>
<p>Your<br>K. M.</p>
<p>Did the 'old man' get the postal order for £2?

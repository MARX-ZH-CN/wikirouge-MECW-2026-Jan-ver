ENGELS TO MARX</p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>Manchester, 31 May 1853</p>
<p>Dear Marx,</p>
<p>The bill on Dana has been paid; we shall have the money tomorrow and shall send it you without delay; Charles<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup>missed the chap twice today. There will be some loss on the rate of exchange, but less, I think, than if the bill were to be negotiated in London.</p>
<p>The parcel of pamphlets<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>has also arrived and will go off tomorrow. I shall keep 8 or 10 up here. It is fairly heavy and cost <i>£</i> 16/- which you can add on to the selling price. DUTY alone was 18/-, so, all things considered, it was a good thing it was addressed to me.</p>
<p>The little man<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>was here on Saturday and seems to be making out better than was to be expected. Buckup told Strohn that he was quite satisfied with him and that he had quickly familiarised himself with the work. I gave him a little sermon about punctuality; anyhow, conditions at Buckup's office are as favourable as he could wish. He is already doing book-keeping and, if he continues to do well for 3 or 4 months, will have a secure berth.</p>
<p>Strohn has gone to the Continent again; he left on Saturday. It was a good thing that he was on the spot for the first fortnight. Nothing new from America this week.</p>
<p>Your</p>
<p>F. E.

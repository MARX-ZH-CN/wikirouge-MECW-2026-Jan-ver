ENGELS TO FERDINAND FREILIGRATH<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>IN LONDON</p>
<p>[Draft]</p>
<p>Manchester, 25 January 1859</p>
<p>Dear Freiligrath,</p>
<p>The bloody boy who was to have got the POST OFFICE ORDER yesterday idled away the time instead, which is why the 22/- will only arrive today. Many thanks for your trouble and for the outlay.</p>
<p>As to the <i>Neueste Rheinische Zeitung,</i> due provision has been made, never fear. We have in the meanwhile learnt a great deal and forgotten nothing,<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup>and that's more than the others can say. Of this you could find no better illustration than the <i>Hermann</i> (clearly a misprint for <i>Gottfried,</i> otherwise the title's meaningless<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" id="cite_ref-3">[3]</a></sup>), which you recently described as the <i>Rheinische Zeitung's</i> John the Baptist. It's a long time since I've read rubbish as insipid, namby-pamby, tail-wagging, lavish of compliments, conciliatory, propitiatory and atrociously written as is found in this, the latest product of the pseudo-noble sometime <i>Maikäfer</i><sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" id="cite_ref-4">[4]</a></sup>which, to judge by its style and content, is aimed solely at and tailored to the tastes of the Cambeiwell philistines and the German ditto in the City. The man has even forgotten what little he managed to pick up in 1848 and has become a real bourgeois windbag. Now, since it was you who brought up the topic of this cheery customer,</p>
<p>presently touting round his 'grief, I will not conceal from you the fact that I have recently been asked by various philistines how it is that you have formed such a bond of friendship with Monsieur Kinkel. T h o u g h an exaggeration, this placed me, as you can imagine, in something of a quandary. Needless to say, I attributed it largely to the malicious exaggeration with which Kinkel and clique had seized on what was a mere encounter with you and blazoned it in all the papers as an offensive and defensive alliance—directed against us—and this I roundly denied. As for your social intercourse with the worthy citizen, all I could do was crack bad jokes, such as that, since poets live in a world apart,</p>
<p>Kinkel could only pass himself off as a poet by citing his intercourse with you, etc. Suffice it to say that, although a poor diplomat, I succeeded well enough in defending the party's position. Moreover, it eventually transpired that one of the Jewish females who patronised the gentle Gottfried when he was last u p here, had said: 'Ah, just let Kinkel, the naughty man, visit Manchester again—he seduced a girl of good family in London and keeps her as his mistress, and that's the reason why his wife....'<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" id="cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>

<li id="cite_note-1"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-1">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">This draft of Engels' letter to Freiligrath was enclosed by Engels in his letter to  Marx of 27 January 1859 (see this volume, p. 373). As follows from that  letter, a three-page fair copy was sent to Freiligrath on 26 January. Neither the  fair copy nor the other draft versions which Engels made while writing the  letter have been preserved.—370</span>

<li id="cite_note-2"><span class="mw-cite-backlink"><a href="#cite_ref-2">↑</a></span> <span class="reference-text">Engels paraphrases the dictum 'They have learned nothing and forgotten  nothing', which during the restoration of the Bourbons (1815-30) was often  applied to their conservative supporters who had failed to draw any lessons  from the French Revolution. The dictum was first used, also in referring to the  French extreme royalists, by Rear Admiral Chevalier de Panât in a letter to the  journalist Mallet du Pan in 1796. In later years it was often attributed to  Charles Talleyrand.—370</span>

With the outbreak of the revolution in Germany in 1848, both the  journal and the club ceased to exist. Marx and Engels gave an ironic  characterisation of the periodical and the club in the pamphlet <i>The Great Men  of the Exile</i> (see present edition, Vol. 11, p. 244).—370</span>

<p>Catapult (Gr. xcn-d, against, and TTCVWOO, to hurl), an ancient military engine for throwing stones, darts, and other missiles, invented in Syracuse, in the reign of Dionysius the elder. It acted upon the principle of the bow, and consisted of wood frame-work, a part of which was elastic, and furnished with tense cords of hair or muscle. Catapults were of various sizes, being designed either for field-service or bombardments. The largest of them projected beams 6 feet long and weighing 60 lbs. to the distance of 400 paces, and Josephus gives instances of their throwing great stones to the distance of 1/4 of a mile.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" id="cite_ref-1">[1]</a></sup> The Romans employed 300 of them at the siege of Jerusalem.<sup class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2" id="cite_ref-2">[2]</a></sup> From the time of Julius Caesar it is not distinguished by Latin authors from the ballista, which was originally used only for throwing masses of stone.

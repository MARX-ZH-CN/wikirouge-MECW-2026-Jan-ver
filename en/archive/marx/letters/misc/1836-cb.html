We, the Rector and Senate of the Royal Prussian Rhenish Frederick William University in Bonn, testify by this certificate that Herr <i>Carl Heinrich Marx</i>, born in Trier, son of Herr Justizrat Marx of the same place, prepared for academic studies at the gymnasium in Trier, on the basis of the certificate of maturity of the above-mentioned gymnasium, was matriculated here on October 17, 1835, has since then resided here until now as a student, and has applied himself to the study of jurisprudence.</p>
<p>During this stay at our University, according to the certificates submitted to us, he has attended the lectures listed below:</p>
<p>
<h5>I. In the winter term 1835/36</h5>

2) Institutions with Professor Bocking, very diligent and with constant attention.<br>

<p>
  In regard to his behaviour, it has to be noted that he has incurred a punishment of one day's detention for disturbing the peace by rowdiness and drunkenness at night; nothing else is known to his disadvantage in a moral or economic respect.

 ...partment. He is coming tomorrow to give the order to the concierge. It was a terrible blow and I leave you to imagine what I'm going to do with my 200 francs, now that I've had to give him 980 fr. as a deposit, half of which he will return when he has
found a tenant.</p>

Such are the delightful consequences of that governmental, Guizotian, Humboldtian disgraceful trick. I don't know what we're going to do. This morning I traipsed all over Paris. The Mint was closed and I shall have to go again. Then I visited the carriers and the agent of a furniture auctioneer. I had no success anywhere. And in the course of these wearisome excursions, what's more, Ewerbeck forced me to call on Mme Glaise, who, however, is quite an amiable, artless and kindly woman who pleased me much. At this moment I'm amusing myself with the infant and the grumbler while writing to you. Little Jenny never stops saying papa. She still has a very bad cold and her little teeth are very painful. However I hope she'll soon be herself again. The person is in good spirits, though this morning she felt quite 'lausig'." I heard from mama today. Edgar will be sitting his exam shortly. Aren't you astonished, my good Karl, at my addressing you in French? But it happened without my thinking about it. I intended to start off with a few sentences in French and then, just as the appetite comes with eating, I was unable to part company with this language. I find it so easy to write to you and chat with you I am writing as fast as I would in German and, although it may not be classical French,  I trust it will amuse you to read it, faults, inexpressible beauties and all. I shall not send off these lines until I get your first letter. Say lots of nice things to our good friend Burgers on my behalf. A thousand kisses from mama to papa, and a  little kiss from  Munsterchen.  Adieu my friend.  I  long to see you again. By now you will already be in Brussels. Best greetings to our new fatherland. Adieu.</p>

Heine was at the Ministry of the Interior where he was told they knew nothing at all about it; Ledru-Rollin will be raising the matter in the Chamber as
soon as everyone has escaped. Have you read the <i>Réforme</i>? What a silly, pitiful thing it is. Everything it says is offensive, more so than the most violent attacks launched by the others. There you have the work of that great man, such as he should be—Mr Bakunin, who, however, came and gave me a lesson in rhetoric and drama in order to unbosom himself to me. Herwegh is playing with the child. Ewerbeck is talking incessantly about the continual distractions of Mr Burgers and the son of the people. Mr Weill, my special protector, came to my aid....</p>

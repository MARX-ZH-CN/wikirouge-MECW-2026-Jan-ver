<i>London, December 18 <span class="inote">[1878]</span></i> – In a little villa at Haverstock Hill,
the northwest portion of London, lives Karl Marx, the cornerstone of modern
socialism. He was exiled from his native country – Germany – in 1844,
for propagating revolutionary theories. In 1848, he returned, but in a
few months was again exiled. He then took up his abode in Paris, but his
political theories procured his expulsion from that city in 1849, and since
that year his headquarters have been in London. His convictions have caused
him trouble from the beginning. Judging from the appearance of his home,
they certainly have not brought him affluence. Persistently during all these
years he has advocated his views with an earnestness which undoubtedly
springs from a firm belief in them, and, however much we may deprecate
their propagation, we cannot but respect to a certain extent the self-denial
of the now venerable exile.
</p>
<p class="information">
Our correspondent has called upon him twice or thrice, and each time
the Doctor was found in his library, with a book in one hand and a cigarette
in the other. He must be over seventy years of age.<sup class="enote"><a href="79-01-05n.html#n18" target=_blank>[18]</a></sup> His
physique is well knit, massive, erect. He has the head of a man of intellect,
and the features of a cultivated Jew. His hair and beard are long, and
iron-gray in color. His eyes are glittering black, shaded by a pair of
bushy eyebrows. To a stranger he shows extreme caution. A foreigner can
generally gain admission; but the ancient-looking German woman
<a href="../../family/demuth/index.html" target=_blank><span class="inote">[Helene Demuth]</span></a> 
who waits upon
visitors has instructions to admit none who hail from the Fatherland, unless
they bring letters of introduction. Once into his library, however, and
having fixed his one eyeglass in the corner of his eye, in order to take your
intellectual breadth and depth, so to speak, he loses that self-restraint,
and unfolds to you a knowledge of men and things throughout the world apt to
interest one. And his conversation does not run in one groove, but is as
varied as are the volumes upon his library shelves. A man can generally be
judged by the books he reads, and you can form your own conclusions when I
tell you a casual glance revealed Shakespeare, Dickens, Thackeray, Moliere,
Racine, Montaigne, Bacon, Goethe, Voltaire, Paine; English, American, French
blue books; works political and philosophical in Russian, German, Spanish,
Italian, etc., etc. During my conversation I was struck with
</p>
<p class="information">
<strong>His Intimacy with American Questions</strong>
which have been uppermost during the past twenty years. His knowledge
of them, and the surprising accuracy with which he criticized our national
and state legislation, impressed upon my mind the fact that he must have
derived his information from inside sources.<sup class="enote"><a href="79-01-05n.html#n19" target=_blank>[19]</a></sup> But, indeed, this knowledge
is not confined to America, but is spread over the face of Europe. When
speaking of his hobby – socialism – he does not indulge in those melodramatic
flights generally attributed to him, but dwells upon his utopian plans
for “the emancipation of the human race” with a gravity and an earnestness
indicating a firm conviction in the realization of his theories, if not
in this century, at least in the next.

<p class="information">
Perhaps Dr. Karl Marx is better known in America as the author of <i>Capital</i>,
and the founder of the International Society, or at least its most prominent
pillar. In the interview which follows, you will see what he says of this
Society as it at present exists. However, in the meantime I will give you
a few extracts from the printed general rules of 
<strong>The International Society</strong>
published in 1871, by order of the General Council, from which you can
form an impartial judgment of its aims and ends. The Preamble sets forth
“that the emancipation of the working classes must be conquered by the
working classes themselves; that the struggle for the emancipation of the
working classes means not a struggle for class privileges and monopolies,
but for equal rights and duties, and the abolition of all class rule; that
the economical subjection of the man of labor to the monopolizer of the
means of labor – that is, the sources of life – lies at the bottom of
servitude in all its forms, of all social misery, mental degradation, and
political dependence; that all efforts aiming at” the universal emancipation
of the working classes “have hitherto failed from want of solidarity between
the manifold divisions of labor in each country,” and the Preamble calls
for “the immediate combination of the still-disconnected movements.” It
goes on to say that the International Association acknowledges “no rights
without duties, no duties without rights” – thus making every member a
worker. the Association was formed at London “to afford a central medium
of communication and cooperation between the workingmen’s societies in
the different countries,” aiming at the same end, namely: “the protection,
advancement, and complete emancipation of the working classes.” “Each member,”
the document further says, “of the International Association, on removing
his domicile from one country to another, will receive the fraternal support
of the associated workingmen."
</p>
<p class="information">
<strong>The Society Consists</strong> 
of a general Congress, which meets annually, a general Council, which
forms “an international agency between the different national and local
groups of the Association, so that the workingmen in one country can be
constantly informed of the movements of their class in every other country."
This Council receives and acts upon the applications of new branches or
sections to join the International, decides differences arising between
the sections, and, in fact, to use an American phrase, “runs the machine."
The expenses of the General Council are defrayed by an annual contribution
of an English penny per member. Then come the federal councils or committees,
and local sections, in the various countries. The federal councils are
bound to send one report at least every month to the General Council, and
every three months a report on the administration and financial state of
their respective branches. whenever attacks against the International are
published, the nearest branch or committee is bound to send at once a copy
of such publication to the General Council. The formation of female branches
among the working classes is recommended.
</p>
<p class="information">

<p class="information">
During my visit to Dr. Marx, I alluded to the platform given by J.C.
Bancroft Davis in his official report of 1877 as the clearest and most
concise exposition of socialism that I had seen.<sup class="enote"><a href="79-01-05n.html#n20" target=_blank>[20]</a></sup> He said it was taken from
the report of the socialist reunion at <a href="../../../../../glossary/events/g/o.html#gotha-congress" target=_blank>Gotha</a>, Germany, in May, 1875. The
translation was incorrect, he said, and he
<strong>Volunteered Corrections</strong> which I append as he dictated:<sup class="enote"><a href="79-01-05n.html#n21" target=_blank>[21]</a></sup></p>
<p class="information">
First: Universal, direct, and secret suffrage for all males over

<p class="information">

Davis’ report there is</p>
<p class="information">
<strong>A Twelfth Clause</strong><sup class="enote"><a href="79-01-05n.html#n24" target=_blank>[24]</a></sup>,
the most important of all, which reads: “State aid and credit for industrial
societies, under democratic direction.” I asked the Doctor why he omitted
this, and he replied:</p>
<p class="indentb">
“When the reunion took place at <a href="../../../../../glossary/events/g/o.html#gotha-congress" target=_blank>Gotha, in 1875</a>, there existed
a division among the Social Democrats. The one wing were partisans of Lassalle,
the others those who had accepted in general the program of the International
organization, and were called the Eisenach party. The twelfth point was
not placed on the platform, but placed in the general introduction by way
of concession to the Lassallians. Afterwards it was never spoken of. Mr.
Davis does not say that is was placed in the program as a compromise having
no particular significance, but gravely puts it in as one of the cardinal
principles of the program.”<sup class="enote"><a href="79-01-05n.html#n25" target=_blank>[25]</a></sup></p>
<p class="information">
“But,” I said, “socialists generally look upon the transformation
of the means of labor into the common property of society as the grand
climax of the movement.”</p>
<p class="indentb">
“Yes; we say that this will be the outcome of the movement, but
it will be a question of time, of education, and the institution of higher
social status.”</p>
<p class="information">
“This platform,” I remarked, “applies only to Germany and one
or two other countries.”</p>
<p class="indentb">
“Ah!” he returned, “if you draw your conclusions from nothing
but this, you know nothing of the activity of the party. Many of its points
have no significance outside of Germany. Spain, Russia, England, and America
have platforms suited to their peculiar difficulties. The only similarity
in them is the end to be attained.”

<p class="information">
“And that is the supremacy of labor?”</p>
<p class="indentb">
“That is the <strong>Emancipation of Labor”</strong></p>
<p class="information">
“Do European socialists look upon the movement in America as a serious
one?”</p>
<p class="indentb">
“Yes: it is the natural outcome of the country’s development.
It has been said that the movement has been imported by foreigners. When
labor movements became disagreeable in England, fifty years ago, the same
thing was said; and that was long before socialism was spoken of. In American,
since 1857, only has the labor movement become conspicuous.<sup class="enote"><a href="79-01-05n.html#n26" target=_blank>[26]</a></sup> Then trade unions
began to flourish; then trades assemblies were formed, in which the workers
in different industries united; and after that came national labor unions.
If you consider this chronological progress, you will see that socialism
has sprung up in that country without the aid of foreigners, and was merely
caused by the concentration of capital and the changed relations between
the workmen and employers.”</p>
<p class="information">
“Now,” asked our correspondent, “what has socialism done so far?”</p>
<p class="indentb">
“Two things,” he returned. “Socialists have shown the general
universal struggle between capital and labor –
<strong>The Cosmopolitan Chapter</strong>
in one word – and consequently tried to bring about an understanding
between the workmen in the different countries, which became more necessary
as the capitalists became more cosmopolitan in hiring labor, pitting foreign
against native labor not only in America, but in England, France, and Germany.
International relations sprang up at once between workingmen in the three
different countries, showing that socialism was not merely a local, but
an international problem, to be solved by the international action of workmen.
The working classes move spontaneously, without knowing what the ends of
the movement will be. The socialists invent no movement, but merely tell
the workmen what its character and its ends will be.”</p>
<p class="information">
“Which means the overthrowing of the present social system,” I
interrupted.</p>
<p class="indentb">
“This system of land and capital in the hands of employers, on the one
hand,” he continued, “and the mere working power in the hands of the laborers
to sell a commodity, we claim is merely a historical phase, which will
pass away and give place to
<strong>A Higher Social Condition</strong>.</p>
<p class="indentb">
We see everywhere a division of society. The antagonism of the two classes
goes hand in hand with the development of the industrial resources of modern
countries. From a socialistic standpoint the means already exist to revolutionize
the present historical phase. Upon trade unions, in many countries, have
been built political organizations. In America the need of an independent
workingmen’s party has been made manifest. They can no longer trust politicians.
Rings and cliques have seized upon the legislatures, and politics has been
made a trade. But America is not alone in this, only its people are more
decisive than Europeans. Things come to the surface quicker. There is less
cant and hypocrisy that there is on this side of the ocean.”</p>
<p class="information">
I asked him to give me a reason for the rapid growth of the socialistic
party in Germany, when he replied:</p>
<p class="indentb">
“The present socialistic party came
last. Theirs was not the utopian scheme which made headway in France and
England. The German mind is given to theorizing, more than that of other
peoples. From previous experience the Germans evolved something practical.
This modern capitalistic system, you must recollect, is quite new in Germany
in comparison to other states. Questions were raised which had become almost
antiquated in France and England, and political influences to which these
states had yielded sprang into life when the working classes of Germany
had become imbued with socialistic theories. therefore, from the beginning
almost of modern industrial development, they have formed an
<strong>Independent Political Party</strong>.</p>
<p class="indentb">
They had their own representatives in the German parliament. There was
no party to oppose the policy of the government, and this devolved upon
them. To trace the course of the party would take a long time; but I may
say this: that, if the middle classes of Germany were not the greatest
cowards, distinct from the middle classes of America and England, all the
political work against the government should have been done by them.”</p>
<p class="information">
I asked him a question regarding the numerical strength of the
Lassallians in the ranks of the Internationalists.</p>
<p class="indentb">
“The party of Lassalle,” he replied, “does not exist. Of course there
are some believers in our ranks, but the number is small. Lassalle anticipated
our general principles. When he commenced to move after the reaction of
1848, he fancied that he could more successfully revive the movement by
advocating cooperation of the workingmen in industrial enterprises. It
was to stir them into activity. He looked upon this merely as a means to
the real end of the movement. I have letters from him to this effect.”<sup class="enote"><a href="79-01-05n.html#n27" target=_blank>[27]</a></sup>
<p class="information">
“You would call it his nostrum?”<sup class="enote"><a href="79-01-05n.html#n28" target=_blank>[28]</a></sup></p>
<p class="indentb">
“Exactly. He called upon Bismarck, told him what he designed,
and Bismarck encouraged Lassalle’s course at that time in every possible
way.”</p>
<p class="information">
“What was his object?”</p>
<p class="indentb">
“He wished to use the working classes as a set-off against the
middle classes who instigated the troubles of 1848.”</p>
<p class="information">
“It is said that you are the head and front of socialism, Doctor,
and from your villa here pull the wires of all the associations, revolutions,
etc., now going on. What do you say about it?”</p>
<p class="indentb">
The old gentleman smiled: “I know it.”</p>
<p class="indentb">
<strong>“It Is Very Absurd</strong>
yet it has a comic side. For two months previous to the attempt of Hoedel,
Bismarck complained in his <i>North German Gazette</i> that I was in league
with Father Beck, the leader of the Jesuit movement, and that we were keeping
the socialist movement in such a condition that he could do nothing with
it.”</p>
<p class="information">
“But your International Society in London directs the movement?”</p>
<p class="indentb">
“The International Society has outlived its usefulness and exists
no longer.<sup class="enote"><a href="79-01-05n.html#n29" target=_blank>[29]</a></sup> It did exist and direct the movement; but the growth of socialism
of late years has been so great that its existence has become unnecessary.
Newspapers have been started in the various countries. These are interchanged.
That is about the only connection the parties in the different countries
have with one another. The International Society, in the first instance,
was created to bring the workmen together, and show the advisability of
effecting organization among their various nationalities. The interests
of each party in the different countries have no similarity. This specter
of the Internationalist leaders sitting at London is a mere invention.
It is true that we dictated to foreign societies when the Internationalist
organization was first accomplished. We were forced to exclude some sections
in New York, among them one in which Madam Woodhull was conspicuous.<sup class="enote"><a href="79-01-05n.html#n30" target=_blank>[30]</a></sup> that
was in 1871. there are several American politicians – I will not name
them – who wish to trade in the movement. They are well known to American
socialists.”</p>
<p class="information">
“You and your followers, Dr. Marx, have been credited with all
sorts of incendiary speeches against religion. Of course you would like
to see the whole system destroyed, root and branch.”</p>
<p class="indentb">
“We know,” he replied after a moment’s hesitation, “that violent
measures against religion are nonsense; but this is an opinion: as socialism
grows,
<strong>Religion Will Disappear</strong>.</p>
<p class="indentb">
Its disappearance must be done by social development, in which education
must play a part.”</p>
<p class="information">
“The Reverend Joseph Cook,<sup class="enote"><a href="79-01-05n.html#n31" target=_blank>[31]</a></sup> of Boston – you know him –”</p>
<p class="indentb">
“We have heard of him, a very badly informed man upon the subject
of socialism.”</p>
<p class="information">
“In a lecture lately upon the subject, he said, ‘Karl Marx is
credited now with saying that, in the United States, and in Great Britain,
and perhaps in France, a reform of labor will occur without bloody revolution,
but that blood must be shed in Germany, and in Russia, and in Italy, and
in Austria.’”</p>
<p class="indentb">
“No socialist,” remarked the Doctor, smiling, “need predict that
there will be a bloody revolution in Russia, Germany, Austria, and possibly
Italy if the Italians keep on in the policy they are now pursuing. The
deeds of the French Revolution may be enacted again in those countries.
That is apparent to any political student. But those revolutions will be
made by the majority. No revolution can be made by a party,
<strong>but By a Nation”</strong>.</p>
<p class="information">
“The reverend gentleman alluded to,” I remarked, “gave an extract from
a letter which he said you addressed to the Communists of Paris in 1871.
Here it is: </p>
<p class="quote">
‘We are as yet but 3,000,000 at most. In twenty years we shall
be 50,000,000 – 100,000,000 perhaps. Then the world will belong to us,
for it will be not only Paris, Lyon, Marseilles, which will rise against
odious capital, but Berlin, Munich, Dresden, London, Liverpool, Manchester,
Brussels, St. Petersburg, New York – in short, the whole world. And before
this new insurrection, such as history has not yet known, the past will
disappear like a hideous nightmare; for the popular conflagration, kindled
at a hundred points at once, will destroy even its memory!’</p>
<p class="information">
Now, Doctor, I suppose you admit the authorship of that extract?”</p>
<p class="indentb">
“I never wrote a word of it. I never write
<strong>Such Melodramatic Nonsense</strong>.</p>
<p class="indentb">
I am very careful what I do write. That was put in <i>Le Figaro</i>,
over my signature, about that time. There were hundreds of the same kind
of letters flying about them. I wrote to the London <i>Times</i> and declared
they were forgeries; but if I denied everything that has been said and
written of me, I would require a score of secretaries.”</p>
<p class="information">
“But you have written in sympathy with the Paris Communists?”</p>
<p class="indentb">
“Certainly I have, in consideration of what was written of them
in leading articles; but the correspondence from Paris in English papers
is quite sufficient to refute the blunders propagated in editorials. The
Commune killed only about sixty people; Marshal MacMahon and his slaughtering
army killed over 60,000. There has never been a movement so slandered as
that of the Commune.”</p>
<p class="information">
“Well, then, to carry out the principles of socialism do its believers
advocate assassination and bloodshed?”</p>
<p class="indentb">
“No great movement,” Karl answered, “has ever been inaugurated
<strong>Without Bloodshed</strong>.</p>
<p class="indentb">
“The independence of America was won by bloodshed, Napoleon captured
France through a bloody process, and he was overthrown by the same means.
Italy, England, Germany, and every other country gives proof of this, and
as for assassination,” he went on to say, “it is not a new thing, I need
scarcely say. Orsini tried to kill Napoleon; kings have killed more than
anybody else; the Jesuits have killed; the Puritans killed at the time
of Cromwell. These deeds were all done or attempted before socialism was
born. Every attempt, however, now made upon a royal or state individual
is attributed to socialism. The socialists would regret very much the death
of the German Emperor at the present time. He is very useful where he is;
and Bismarck has done more for the cause than any other statesman, by driving
things to extremes.”</p>
<p class="information">
I asked Dr. Marx
<strong>What He Thought of Bismarck</strong>.</p>
<p class="indentb">
He replied that “Napoleon was considered a genius until he fell; then
he was called a fool. Bismarck will follow in his wake. He began by building
up a despotism under the plea of unification. his course has been plain
to all. The last move is but an attempted imitation of a <i>coup d’etat</i>;
but it will fail. The socialists of Germany, as of France, protested against
the war of 1870 as merely dynastic. They issued manifestoes foretelling
the German people, if they allowed the pretended war of defense to be turned
into a war of conquest, they would be punished by the establishment of
military despotism and the ruthless oppression of the productive masses.
The Social-Democratic party in Germany, thereupon holding meetings and
publishing manifestoes for an honorable peace with France, were at once
prosecuted by the Prussian Government, and many of the leaders imprisoned.
Still their deputies alone dared to protest, and very vigorously too, in
the German Reichstag, against the forcible annexation of French provinces.
However, Bismarck carried his policy by force, and people spoke of the
genius of a Bismarck. The war was fought, and when he could make no conquests,
he was called upon for original ideas, and he has signally failed. The
people began to lose faith in him. His popularity was on the wane. He needs
money, and the state needs it. Under a sham constitution he has taxed the
people for his military and unification plans until he can tax them no
longer, and now he seeks to do it with no constitution at all. For the
purpose of levying as he chooses, he has raised the ghost of socialism,<sup class="enote"><a href="79-01-05n.html#n32" target=_blank>[32]</a></sup>
and has done everything in his power
<strong>To Create an <i>Emeute</i></strong>.”</p>
<p class="information">
“You have continual advice from Berlin?”</p>
<p class="indentb">
“Yes,” he said; “my friends keep me well advised. It is in a perfectly
quiet state, and Bismarck is disappointed. He has expelled forty-eight
prominent men – among them Deputies Hasselman and Fritsche and Rackow,
Bauman, and Adler, of the <i>Freie Presse</i>.<sup class="enote"><a href="79-01-05n.html#n33" target=_blank>[33]</a></sup> These men kept the workmen
of Berlin quiet. Bismarck knew this. He also knew that there were 75,000
workmen in that city upon the verge of starvation. Once those leaders were
gone, he was confident that the mob would rise, and that would be the cue
for a carnival of slaughter. The screws would then be put upon the whole
German Empire; his petty theory of blood and iron would then have full
sway, and taxation could be levied to any extent. So far no <i>emeute</i>
has occurred, and he stands today confounded at the situation and the ridicule
of all statesmen.”</p>

After the <a href="../../works/1871/civil-war-france/index.html" target=_blank>Paris Commune</a> shocked the world –
including the state-led massacres of the Communards that followed right after
– Karl Marx became a very famous person. The myth ran that he was the
mastermind behind the uprising and the International Working Men's
Association was a vast conspiratorial organization of destruction and
nefarious violence.

<p>Because of all this rumor-mongering going on – indeed, if you
read Usenet, still going on – the reporters in the following pieces usually
felt compelled to draw great attention to Marx's actual living conditions
or his general demeanor – which hardly befit the "diabolical genius" they
expected. As a British politician tells Queen Victoria's eldest daughter
in a private letter (below), after doing a wee bit of spying for her and
met with Marx:

<p class="quote">
"The face is somewhat round, the forehead well shaped and filled up
– the eye rather hard but the whole expression rather pleasant than not,
by no means that of a gentleman who is in the habit of eating babies in
their cradles – which is I daresay the view the Police takes of him."

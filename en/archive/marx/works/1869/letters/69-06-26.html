<h4>June 26, 1869</h4>
<p class="fst">When rearranging my bookshelves, I came across a small old edition of La Rochefoucauld’s <i>Réflexions etc. </i>Leafing through it I found this:</p>
<p class="indentb">“Sobriety is a mystery of the body, invented to hide the defects of the spirit.”</p>
<p><i>Thus Stern </i>pinched it from La Rochefoucauld!</p>
<p>Very nice, too:</p>
<p class="indentb">“We are all strong enough to suffer the misfortunes of others.”</p>
<p class="indentb">“The old like to give good precepts as a consolation for no longer being able to give bad examples.”</p>
<p class="indentb">“Kings mint people like coins; they give them any value they wish; and one is forced to accept them according to their rate of exchange, and not according to their true price.”</p>
<p class="indentb">“When vices abandon us, we flatter ourselves with the belief that it is we who have abandoned them.”</p>
<p class="indentb">“Moderation is languor and indolence of the soul, just as ambition is its activity and ardour.”</p>
<p class="indentb">“We often pardon those who bore us, but we can never pardon those whom we bore.”</p>
<p class="indentb">“The reason that lovers never tire of each other’s company, is that they always talk about themselves.”</p>

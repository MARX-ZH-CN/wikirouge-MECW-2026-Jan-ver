<h4>December 17, 1869</h4>
<p>Our Irish resolutions have been sent to all trade unions that maintain ties with us. Only one has protested, a small branch of the curriers, saying they are political and not within the Council’s sphere of action. We are sending a deputation to enlighten them. Mr. Odger now understands how useful it was for him that he voted <i>for </i>the resolutions despite all sorts of diplomatic objections. As a result the 3,000-4,000 Irish electors in Southwark have promised him their votes.</p>

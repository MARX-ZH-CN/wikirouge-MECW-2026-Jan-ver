<h4>Bremen, after July 27, 1839</h4>
<p>Dear Fritz,</p>
<p><i>Recepi litteras tuas hodie, et </i>jamque tibi respomurus sum. [I received your letter today, and I am already about to answer you.] I cannot write very much to you — you are still in my debt, and I am expecting a long letter from you. Is your brother Wilhelm on holiday too? Is Wurm now studying with you in Bonn? God bless fat Peter [Jonghaus] in his <i>studia militaria</i>. A little poem written on July 27 [the anniversary of the July 1830 revolution in France] may give you practice in liberalism and in reading ancient metre. Otherwise there is nothing in it.</p>
<h4>German July Days 1839</h4>
<p class="verse">
How the waves mount up in the roaring gale, how the storm comes relentlessly onwardst<br>
Tall as a man are the foaming waves, and the skiff goes rising and falling;<br>
From the Rhine there blows a whirling wind that musters the clouds in the heavens,<br>
That splits up oaks and whips up dust and lashes the waves in its fury.<br>
Of you I think in my tossing skiff, you German kings and you princes.<br>
How the patient people bore on their heads the gilded throne you ascended,<br>
In triumph carried you through the land and sent the bold conqueror fleeing. [allusion to Napoleon I]<br>
Brazenly arrogant then you became, you betrayed all the promises given.<br>
Now a storm blows up out of France, and the people rise up in their masses,<br>
And your throne is rocked like the skiff in the storm and your hand loses hold of the sceptre.<br>
You above all, Ernst August, I challenge with angry defiance.<br>
Despotic and reckless, you flouted the law-now hark to the storm as it rises!<br>
The people look up with piercing eyes and the sword barely rests in the scabbard.<br>
Speak! Are you safe on your golden throne, as I in my boat on the waters?</p>
<p>The business about the high waves on the Weser is quite true, also that I was sailing on it on the great day of the July revolution.</p>
<p>Give my regards to Wurm and tell him that he must write me a lot.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Yours,</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><i>Friedr. Engels</i></p>

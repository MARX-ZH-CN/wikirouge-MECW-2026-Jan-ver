<p class="verse">Why can you never leave what’s well alone <br>
And let a little honest striving<br>
Or well-meant words said in a kindly tone<br>
Do their good work among the living?<br>
To falsify what people really mean<br>
Is very easy to arrange.<br>
Bad in the good is all too quickly seen, <br>
But good to bad you'll never change.</p>
<p class="verse">Or is it that you seriously expect<br>
To gain advantages by making light<br>
Of others’ efforts? If you want respect,<br>
Then win respect in your own right.<br>
Use your own brains then; if you would succeed<br>
Prepare to make the upward climb;<br>
Hanging behind those who are in the lead, <br>
Belittling them, you waste your time.</p>
<p class="verse">Say, can you hope to do the courier wrong<br>
For whom you lay your spiteful snares?<br>
He carries news, so let him pass along<br>
As on his lawful way he fares.<br>
If truth he brings, truth shall indeed prevail, <br>
Transcending perfidy and fraud.<br>
The wise old saying hits it on the nail<br>
"Honesty is its own reward.”</p>

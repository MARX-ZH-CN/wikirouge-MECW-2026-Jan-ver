 We learn from the public papers, that the <i>Neue Preussische Zeitung</i> has, of late, published a series of revelations concerning that part of the German and particularly the Prussian emigration which, at the present moment, resides in London; that the above-named paper has spoken of certain relations existing between London and Berlin, and that it has brought the name of one of the undersigned in connexion with this subject.
</p><p>
 The Society of which we are members does not take in the <i>Neue Preussische Zeitung.</i> We therefore take the liberty of addressing ourselves to you, and we expect from your loyalty, that you, Sir, the official representative in this country, of our nationality, will have the <i>courtoisie</i> to furnish us with the numbers in question of the<i> Neue Preussische Zeitung.</i>
We have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servants

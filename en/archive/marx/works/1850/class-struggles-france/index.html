<p class="information">“Great importance must be attached to one of the
historical documents of the German labour movement: the Preface written by
Fredrick Engels for the 1895 re-issue of Marx's Class Struggles in France ...
looking back upon the year 1848, he showed that the belief that the socialist
revolution was imminent had become obsolete ... Engels demonstrated, as an
expert in military science, that it was a pure illusion to believe that the
workers could, in the existing state of military technique and of industry, and
in view of the characteristics of the great towns of today, successfully bring
about a revolution by street fighting.” <a href="../../../../luxemburg/1918/12/30.html" target=_blank>Rosa Luxemburg, 1918</a>.</p>

<p class="fst">With the exception of only a few chapters, every important part
of the revolutionary annals from 1848 to 1849 bear the heading: <i>Defeat of
the revolution!</i></p>
<p>What succumbed in these defeats was not the revolution. It was the
pre-revolutionary traditional appendages, results of social relationships which
had not yet come to the point of sharp class antagonisms — persons,
illusions, conceptions, projects from which the revolutionary party before the
February Revolution was not free, from which it could be freed not by the
<i>victory of February</i>, but only by a series of <i>defeats</i>.</p>
<p>In a word: The revolution made progress, forged ahead, not by its immediate
tragicomic achievements but, on the contrary, by the creation of a powerful,
united counterrevolution, by the creation of an opponent in combat with whom
the party of overthrow ripened into a really revolutionary party.</p>
<p>To prove this is the task of the following pages.</p>

<p class="information">Marx’s <i>The Class Struggles in France,
</i>1848 <i>to </i>1850 consists of a series of articles written between
January and October 1850 specially for the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung.
Politisch-ökonomische Revue </i>and published in it under the general title
“1848-1849.” This is a most important work summing up the results
of the 1848-49 revolution. In preparation for this work, Marx used French
newspaper reports, reports published in the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung,
</i>and accounts given by witnesses – French and German revolutionary
refugees, among them Ferdinand Wolff, the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung
</i>Paris correspondent, and another Communist League member, Sebastian
Seiler, who was a stenographer to the French National Assembly in 1848 and 1849
and wrote a pamphlet on the events of June 13, 1849, which he presented to
Marx. Marx was also probably familiar with Ledru-Rollin’s pamphlet on the
same subject.</p>
<p class="information">According to the original plan the work was to consist
of four articles: “The Defeat of June 1848,” “June 13,
1849,” “Repercussions of June 13 on the Continent” and
“Current Situation; England.” However, in Nos. 1, 2 and 3 of the
journal only three articles were published: “The Defeat of June
1848,” “June 13, 1849” and “Consequences of June 13,
1849.” The influence of the June 1849 events on the Continent and the
situation in England were treated in other items of the journal. particularly
in the international reviews written jointly by Marx and Engels.</p>
<p class="information">The work was not reprinted in full during Marx’s
lifetime. In 1895 it came out in book form in Berlin, with an Introduction by
Engels. The title <i>The Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850 </i>was
given by Engels and the work has since appeared under this title in various
languages. In the 1895 edition, Engels added the fourth chapter, which included
the sections of the third international review dealing with events in France.
Engels entitled this chapter “The Abolition of Universal Suffrage in
1850.” Engels wrote to Richard Fischer on February 13, 1895, that the
fourth chapter “will serve as a factual conclusion to the work as a
whole, without which it would have remained a fragment.” At the same
time, the headings of the first three chapters were changed: I. “From
February to June 1848,” II. “From June 1848 to June 13,
1849,” III. “From June 13, 1849, to March 10, 1850.” In the
present edition, the headings of the first three chapters are given according
to the journal, while the heading of the fourth chapter is given as in the 1895
edition.</p>
<p class="information">The publication of the series of Marx’s articles
drew the attention of the press. A short announcement of No. 1 of the <i>Neue
Rheinische Zeitung. Politisch-ökonomische Revue </i>and quotations from
Marx’s work were published in the <i>Freischütz. </i>Hamburg, No. 40,
April 2, 1850; a review in the <i>Wochenblatt der Hornisse, </i>Cassel, No.
3, April 15, 1850~ The preface and the first article were reprinted in the
<i>Deutsche Londoner Zeitung Nos. </i>262, 263 and 264, April 5, 12 arid 19,
1850. On January 1, 1852, the <i>Turn-Zeitung, </i>published by German
socialist emigrants in the USA, carried an article by Joseph Weydemeyer
“On the Dictatorship of the Proletariat,” written under the direct
influence of Marx’s work, the first work by Marx and Engels in which the
term “the dictatorship of the proletariat” was used. On the other
hand, the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat brought criticism of the
author from the petty-bourgeois democrats. The <i>Neue Deutsche Zeitung,
</i>whose editor was a former “true socialist,” Otto Luning,
published a review (Nos. 148-51, June 22-23, 25 and 26. 1850) of the four
numbers of the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung. Politisch-ökonomische Revue
</i>with unfavourable comments on this proposition and an incorrect
interpretation of it. Marx was obliged to write Lüning a special letter
rebuffing attempts to distort and dispute the idea of the dictatorship of the
proletariat.</p>
<p class="information">Marx and Engels attached great importance to the
popularisation of the ideas contained in <i>The Class Struggles in France
</i>among the English workers. Engels used this work in his <i>Letters from
France </i>published in <i>The Democratic Review</i> and, on the basis of
the first article in the series, wrote <i>Two Years of a Revolution,
</i>which was published in the same journal. Excerpts from Marx’s work
were cited by his contemporaries (Hermann Becker, Proudhon).</p>
<p class="information">Excerpts from <i>The Class Struggles in France
</i>were first published in English in the journal <i>The Marxian, </i>New
York, 1921, Vol. 1, No. 2, and it appeared in full as a separate edition by
Labour News Company, New York, 1924.</p>
<p class="information">In this volume, the work is published after the <i>Neue
Rheinische Zeitung. Politisch-ökonomische Revue </i>text, checked with that of
the 1895 edition prepared by Engels. The <i>Revue </i>published it from the
manuscript and since Marx’s handwriting was difficult to decipher,
mistakes cropped up. In the present edition, all changes in style, spelling,
punctuation and other corrections made by Engels have been taken into account,
as well as errata printed in the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung.
Politisch-ökonomische Revue </i>(to the first number in the second, and to the
second and third in the fourth).</p>
<p class="information">Account has also been taken of the analysis, carried out
by the editorial commission working on the Marx/EngeIs, <i>Gesamtausgabe</i>
(MEGA), erste Abteilung, 10. Bd. and kindly made available to us, of the marks
and corrections made by Marx and Engels in their copies of the journal.
Engels’ corrections apparently date f torn 1895 when he republished
<i>The Class Struggles </i>(in the 1895 edition, however, they were only
partly taken into account). It is also probable that Engels intended to
republish the <i>Revue </i>in full. Some corrections by Marx and Engels
coinciding with the errata printed in the <i>Revue </i>have been silently
inserted in the text of the present edition. Changes in meaning are indicated
in footnotes.</p>
<p class="information">Besides this, obviously inaccurate dates and factual
data, including those in the 1850 and 1895 editions, have also been silently
corrected. Comments are not usually made on Marx’s free translation of
quotations, except when the words Marx puts in quotation marks are not true
quotations but convey the general meaning of the cited passages. </p>

<p class="title">The Peasant War in Germany by Frederick Engels</p>
<h1>Chapter 4<br>
Uprising of the Nobility </h1>
<p class="fst">While the fourth Union Shoe Organisation was being suppressed in
the Black Forest, Luther, in Wittenberg, gave the signal to a movement which
was destined to draw all the estates into its torrent, and to shake the whole
empire. The theses of this Augustinian from Thuringia had the effect of
lightning in a powder magazine. The manifold and contradictory strivings of the
knights and the middle-class, the peasants and the plebeians, the princes
craving for sovereignty, the lower clergy, secretly playing at mysticism and
the learned writer's opposition of a satirical and burlesque nature, found in
Luther's theses a common expression around which they grouped themselves with
astounding rapidity. This alliance of all the opposing elements, though formed
overnight and of brief duration, suddenly revealed the enormous power of the
movement, and gave it further impetus.</p>
<p>But this very rapid growth of the movement was also destined to develop the
seeds of discord which were hidden in it. It was destined to tear asunder at
least those portions of the aroused mass which, by their very situation in
life, were directly opposed to each other, and to put them in their normal
state of mutual hostility. Already in the first years of the Reformation, the
assembling of the heterogeneous mass of the opposition around two central
points became a fact. Nobility and middle-class grouped themselves
unconditionally around Luther. Peasants and plebeians, yet failing to see in
Luther a direct enemy, formed a separate revolutionary party of the opposition.
This was nothing new, since now the movement bad become much more general, much
broader in scope and deeper than it was in the pre-Luther times, which
necessarily brought about a sharp antagonism and an open struggle between the
two parties. This direct opposition soon became apparent. Luther and Muenzer,
fighting in the press and in the pulpit, were as much opposed to each other as
were the armies of princes, knights and cities (consisting, as they did, mainly
of Lutherans or of forces at least inclined towards Lutherism), and the hordes
of peasants and plebeians routed by those armies.</p>
<p>The divergence of interests of the various elements accepting the
Reformation became apparent even before the Peasant War in the attempt of the
nobility to realise its demands as against the princes and the clergy.</p>
<p>The situation of the German nobility at the beginning of the Sixteenth
Century has been depicted above. The nobility was losing its independence to
the ever-increasing power of the lay and clerical princes. It realised that in
the same degree as it was going down as a group in society, the power of the
empire was going down as well, dissolving itself into a number of sovereign
principalities. The collapse of the nobility coincided, in its own opinion,
with the collapse of the German nation. Added to it was the fact that the
nobility, especially that section of it which was under the empire, by virtue
of its military occupation and its attitude towards the princes, directly
represented the empire and the imperial power. The nobility was the most
national of the estates, and it knew that the stronger were the imperial power
and the unity of Germany, and the weaker and less numerous the princes, the
more powerful would the nobility become. It was for that reason that the
knighthood was generally dissatisfied with the pitiful political situation of
Germany, with the powerlessness of the empire in foreign affairs, which
increased in the same degree as, by inheritance, the court was adding to the
empire one province after the other, with the intrigues of foreign powers
inside of Germany and with the plottings of German princes with foreign
countries against the power of the empire. It was for that reason, also, that
the demands of the nobility instantly assumed the form of a demand for the
reform of the empire, the victims of which were to be the princes and the
higher clergy. Ulrich of Hutten, the theoretician of the German nobility,
undertook to formulate this demand in combination with Franz von Sickingen, its
military and diplomatic representative.</p>
<p>The reform of the empire as demanded by the nobility was conceived by Hutten
in a very radical spirit and expressed very clearly. Hutten demanded nothing
else than the elimination of all princes, the secularisation of all church
principalities and estates, and the restoration of <i>a democracy of the
nobility</i> headed by a monarchy — a form of government reminiscent of
the heyday of the late Polish republic. Hutten and Sickingen believed that the
empire would again become united, free and powerful, should the rule of the
nobility, a predominantly military class, be reestablished, the princes, the
elements of disintegration, removed, the power of the priests annihilated, and
Germany tom away from under the dominance of the Roman Church.</p>
<p>Founded on serfdom this democracy of the nobility, the prototype of which
could be found in Poland and, in the empires conquered by the Germanic tribes,
at least in their first centuries, is one of the most primitive forms of
society, and its normal course of development is to become an extensive feudal
hierarchy, which was a considerable advance. Such a powerful democracy of the
nobility had already become an impossibility in Germany of the Sixteenth
Century, first of all because there existed at that time important and powerful
German cities and there was no prospect of an alliance between nobility and the
cities such as brought about in England the transformation of the feudal order
into a bourgeois constitutional monarchy. In Germany, the old nobility
survived, while in England it was exterminated by the <a href="notes.html#17" target=_blank>Wars of the Roses</a>, only twenty-eight families
remaining, and was superseded by a new nobility of middle-class derivation and
middle-class tendencies. In Germany, serfdom was still the common practice, the
nobility drawing its income from feudal sources, while in England serfdom had
been virtually eliminated, and the nobility had become plain middle-class land
owners, with a <i>middle-class</i> source of income — the ground rent.
Finally, that centralisation of absolute monarchial power which in France had
existed and kept growing since Louis XI due to the clash of interests between
nobility and middle-class, was impossible in Germany where conditions for
national centralisation existed in a very rudimentary form, if at all.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, the greater was Hutten's determination to carry out
his ideals in practice, the more concessions was he compelled to make, and the
more clouded did his plan of reforming the empire become. Nobility, alone,
lacked power to put the reform through. This was manifest from its weakness in
comparison with the princes. Allies were to be looked for, and these could only
be found either in the cities, or among the peasantry and the influential
advocates of reform. But the cities knew the nobility too well to trust them,
and they rejected all forms of alliance. The peasants justly saw in the
nobility, which exploited and mistreated them, their bitterest enemy, and as to
the theoreticians of reform, they made common cause with the middle-class, the
princes, or the peasants. What advantages, indeed, could the nobility promise
the middle-class or the peasants from a reform of the empire whose main task it
was to lift the nobility into a higher position? Under these circumstances
Hutten could only be silent in his propaganda writings about the future
interrelations between the nobility, the cities and the peasants, or to mention
them only briefly, putting all evils at the feet of the princes, the priests,
and the dependence upon Rome, and showing the middle-class that it was in their
interests to remain at least neutral in the coming struggle between the
nobility and the princes. No mention was ever made by Hutten of abolishing
serfdom or other burdens imposed upon the peasants by the nobility.</p>
<p>The attitude of the German nobility towards the peasants of that time was
exactly the same as that of the Polish nobility towards its peasants in the
insurrections since 1830. As in the modern Polish upheavals, the movement could
have been brought to a successful conclusion only by an alliance of all the
opposition parties, mainly the nobility and the peasants. But of all alliances,
this one was entirely impossible on either side. The nobility was not ready to
give up its political privileges and its feudal rights over the peasants, while
the revolutionary peasants could not be drawn by vague prospects into an
alliance with the nobility, the class which was most active in their
oppression. The nobility could not win over the German peasant in 1522, as it
failed in Poland in 1830. Only total abolition of serfdom, bondage and all
privileges of nobility could have united the rural population with it. The
nobility, like every privileged class, had not, however, the slightest desire
to give up its privileges, its favourable situation, and the major parts of its
sources of income.</p>
<p>Thus it came about that when the struggle broke out, the nobles were alone
in the field against the princes. It was obvious that the princes, who, for two
centuries had been taking the ground from under the nobility's feet, would this
time also gain a victory without much effort.</p>
<p>The course of the struggle itself is well known. Hutten and Sickingen,
already recognised as the political and military chiefs of the middle German
nobility, organised in Landau, in 1522, a union of the Rhenish, Suabian and
Franconian nobility for the duration of six years, ostensibly for self-defense.
Sickingen assembled an army, partly out of his own means and partly in
combination with the neighbouring knights. He organised the recruiting of
armies and reinforcements in Franconia, along the Lower Rhine, in the
Netherlands and in Westphalia, and in September, 1522, he opened hostilities by
declaring a feud against the Elector-Archbishop of Trier. While he was
stationed near Trier, his reinforcements were cut off by a quick intervention
of the princes. The Landgrave of Hesse and the Elector Palatine went to the aid
of the Archbishop of Trier, and Sickingen was hastily compelled to retreat to
his castle, Landstuhl. In spite of all the efforts of Hutten and the remainder
of his friends, the united nobility, intimidated by the concentrated and quick
action of the princes, left him in the lurch. Sickingen was mortally wounded,
surrendered Landstuhl, and soon afterwards he died. Hutten was compelled to
flee to Switzerland, where he died a few months later on the Isle of Ufnau, on
the Lake of Zurich.</p>
<p>With this defeat, and with the death of both leaders, the power of the
nobility as a body, independent of the princes, was broken. From then on the
nobility appeared only in the service and under the leadership of the princes.
The Peasant War, which soon broke out, drove the nobles still more deeply under
the direct or indirect protection of the princes. It proved that the German
nobility preferred to continue the exploitation of the peasants under princely
sovereignty, rather than overthrow the princes and priests through an open
alliance with the <i>emancipated</i> peasants.</p>

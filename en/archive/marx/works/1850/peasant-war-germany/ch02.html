<p class="title">The Peasant War in Germany by Frederick Engels</p>
<h1>Chapter 2<br>
The Main Opposition Groups and their Programmes; Luther and Muenzer </h1>
<p class="fst">The grouping of the numerous and variegated groups into bigger
units was at that time made impossible by decentralisation, by local and
provincial independence, by industrial and commercial isolation of the
provinces from each other, and by poor means of communication. This grouping
develops only with the general spread of revolutionary, religious and political
ideas, in the course of the Reformation. The various groups of the population
which either accept or oppose those ideas, concentrate the nation, very slowly
and only approximately indeed, into three large camps, the reactionary or
Catholic, the reformist middle-class or Lutheran, and the revolutionary
elements. If we discover little logic even in this great division of the
nation, if the first two camps include partly the same elements, it is due to
the fact that most of the official groupings brought over from the Middle Ages
had begun to dissolve and to become decentralised, which circumstance gave to
the same groups in different localities a momentary opposing orientation. In
the last years we have so often met with similar facts in Germany that we will
not be surprised at this apparent mixture of groups and classes under the much
more complicated conditions of the Sixteenth Century.</p>
<p>The German ideology of to-day sees in the struggles to which the Middle Ages
had succumbed nothing but violent theological bickerings, this notwithstanding
our modern experiences. Had the people of that time only been able to reach an
understanding concerning the celestial things, say our patriotic historians and
wise statesmen, there would have been no ground whatever for struggle over
earthly affairs. These ideologists were gullible enough to accept on their face
value all the illusions which an epoch maintains about itself, or which the
ideologists of a certain period maintained about that period. This class of
people, which saw in the revolution of 1789 nothing but a heated debate over
the advantages of a constitutional monarchy as compared with absolutism, would
see in the July Revolution a practical controversy over the untenability of the
empire by the grace of God, and in the 'February Revolution, an attempt at
solving the problem of a republic or monarchy, etc. Of the <i>class
struggles</i> which were being fought out in these convulsions, and whose mere
expression is being every time written as a political slogan on the banner of
these class struggles, our ideologists have no conception even at the present
time, although manifestations of them are audible enough not only abroad, but
also from the grumbling and the resentment of many thousands of home
proletarians.</p>
<p>In the so-called religious wars of the Sixteenth Century, very positive
material class-interests were at play, and those wars were class wars just as
were the later collisions in England and France. If the class struggles of that
time appear to bear religious earmarks, if the interests, requirements and
demands of the various classes hid themselves behind a religious screen, it
little changes the actual situation, and is to be explained by conditions of
the time.</p>
<p>The Middle Ages had developed out of raw primitiveness. It had done away
with old civilisation, old philosophy, politics and jurisprudence, in order to
begin anew in every respect. The only thing which it had retained from the old
shattered world was Christianity and a number of half-ruined cities deprived of
their civilisation. As a consequence, the clergy retained a monopoly of
intellectual education, a phenomenon to be found in every primitive stage of
development, and education itself had acquired a predominantly theological
nature.</p>
<p>In the hands of the clergy, politics and jurisprudence, as well as other
sciences, remained branches of theology, and were treated according to the
principles prevailing in the latter. The dogmas of the church were at the same
time political axioms, and Bible quotations had the validity of law in every
court. Even after the formation of a special class of jurists, jurisprudence
long remained under the tutelage of theology. This supremacy of theology in the
realm of intellectual activities was at the same time a logical consequence of
the situation of the church as the most general force coordinating and
sanctioning existing feudal domination.</p>
<p>It is obvious that under such conditions, all general and overt attacks on
feudalism, in the first place attacks on the church, all revolutionary, social
and political doctrines, necessarily became theological heresies. In order to
be attacked, existing social conditions had to be stripped of their aureole of
sanctity.</p>
<p>The revolutionary opposition to feudalism was alive throughout all the
Middle Ages. According to conditions of the time, it appeared either in the
form of mysticism, as open heresy, or of armed insurrection. As mysticism, it
is well known how indispensable it was for the reformers of the Sixteenth
Century. Muenzer himself was largely indebted to it. The heresies were partly
an expression of the reaction of the patriarchal Alpine shepherds against the
encroachments of feudalism in their realm( <a href="notes.html#4" target=_blank>Waldenses</a>,
partly an opposition to feudalism of the cities that had out-grown it (The
Albigenses, Arnold of Brescia, etc.), and partly direct insurrections of
peasants (John Ball, the master from Hungary in Picardy, etc.). We can omit, in
this connection, the patriarchal heresy of the Waldenses, as well as the
insurrection of the Swiss, which by form and contents, was a reactionary
attempt at stemming the tide of historic development, and of a purely local
importance. In the other two forms of mediaeval heresy, we find as early as the
Twelfth Century the precursors of the great division between the middle-class
and the peasant-plebeian opposition which caused the collapse of the peasant
war. This division is manifest throughout the later Middle Ages<a id="art">.</a></p>
<p>The heresy of the cities, which is the actual official heresy of the Middle
Ages, directed itself primarily against the clergy, whose riches and political
importance it attacked. In the very same manner as the bourgeoisie at present
demands a <i>"gouvernement à bon marché"</i> (cheap government), so the
middle-class of mediaeval times demanded first of all an <i>"église à bon
marché</i> (cheap church). Reactionary in form, as is every heresy which sees
in the further development of church and dogma, only a degeneration, the
middle-class heresy demanded the restoration of the ancient simple church
constitution and the abolition of an exclusive class of priests. This cheap
arrangement would eliminate the monks, the prelates, the Roman court, in brief,
everything which was expensive for the church. In their attack against papacy,
the cities, themselves republics although under the protection of monarchs,
expressed for the first time in a general form the idea that the normal form of
government for the bourgeoisie was the republic. Their hostility towards many a
dogma and church law is partly explained by the foregoing and partly by their
conditions. Why they were so bitter against celibacy, no one has given a better
explanation than Boccaccio. <a href="notes.html#5" target=_blank>Arnold of Brescia</a> in
Italy and Germany, the <a href="notes.html#6" target=_blank>Albigenses</a> in south France, <a href="notes.html#7" target=_blank>John Wycliffe</a> in England, <a href="notes.html#8" target=_blank>Huss</a>
and the <a href="notes.html#9" target=_blank>Calixtines</a> in Bohemia, were the chief
representatives of this opposition. That the opposition against feudalism
should appear here only as an opposition against religious feudalism, is easily
understood when one remembers that, at that time, the cities were already a
recognised estate sufficiently capable of fighting lay feudalism with its
privileges either by force of arms or in the city assemblies.</p>
<p>Here, as in south France, in England and Bohemia, we find the lower nobility
joining hands with the cities in their struggle against the clergy and in their
heresies, a phenomenon due to the dependence of the lower nobility upon the
cities and to the community of interests of both groups as against the princes
and the prelates. The same phenomenon is found in the peasant war.</p>
<p>A totally different character was assumed by that heresy which was a direct
expression of the peasant and plebeian demands, and which was almost always
connected with an insurrection. This heresy, sharing all the demands of
middle-class heresy relative to the clergy, the papacy, and the restoration of
the ancient Christian church organisation, went far beyond them. It demanded
the restoration of ancient Christian equality among the members of the
community, this to be recognised as a rule for the middle-class world as well.
From the equality of the children of God it made the implication as to civil
equality, and partly also as to equality of property. To make the nobility
equal to the peasant, the patricians and the privileged middle-class equal to
the plebeians, to abolish serfdom, ground rents, taxes, privileges, and at
least the most flagrant differences of property — these were demands put
forth with more or less definiteness and regarded as naturally emanating from
the ancient Christian doctrine. This peasant-plebeian heresy, in the fullness
of feudalism, e. g., among the Albigenses, hardly distinguishable from the
middle-class opposition, grew in the course of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth
Centuries to be a strongly defined party opinion appearing independently
alongside the heresy of the middle-class. This is the case with John Ball,
preacher of the Wat Tyler insurrection in England alongside the Wycliffe
movement. This is also the case with the Taborites alongside the Calixtines in
Bohemia. The Taborites showed even a republican tendency under theocratic
colouring, a view later developed by the representatives of the plebeians in
Germany in the Fifteenth and at the beginning of the Sixteenth Century.</p>
<p>This form of heresy was joined in by the dream visions of the mystic sects,
such as the <a href="notes.html#10" target=_blank>Scourging Friars</a>, the <a href="notes.html#11" target=_blank>Lollards</a>, etc., which in times of suppression continued
the revolutionary tradition.</p>
<p>The plebeians of that time were the only class outside of the existing
official society. It was outside the feudal, as well as outside the
middle-class organisation. It had neither privileges nor property; it was
deprived even of the possessions owned by peasant or petty bourgeois, burdened
with crushing duties as much as they might be; it was deprived of property and
rights in every respect; it lived in such a manner that it did not even come
into direct contact with the existing institutions, which ignored it
completely. It was a living symptom of the dissolution of the feudal and guild
middle-class societies, and it was at the same time the first precursor of
modern bourgeois society.</p>
<p>This position of the plebeians is sufficient explanation as to why the
plebeian opposition of that time could not be satisfied with fighting feudalism
and the privileged middle-class alone; why, in fantasy, at least, it reached
beyond modern bourgeois society then only in its inception; why, being an
absolutely propertyless faction, it questioned institutions, views and
conceptions common to every society based on division of classes. The <a href="notes.html#12" target=_blank>chiliastic dream-visions </a>ancient Christianity offered
in this respect a very serviceable starting-point. On the other hand, this
reaching out beyond not only the present but also the future, could not help
being violently fantastic. At the first practical application, it naturally
fell back into narrow limits set by prevailing conditions. The attack on
private property, the demand for community of possession had to solve itself
into a crude organisation of charity; vague Christian equality could result in
nothing but civic equality before the law; abolition of all officialdom
transformed itself finally in the organisation of republican governments
elected by the people. Anticipation of communism by human fantasy was in
reality anticipation of modern bourgeois conditions.</p>
<p>This anticipation of coming stages of historic development, forced in
itself, but a natural outcome of the life conditions of the plebeian group, is
first to be noted in Germany, in the teachings of Thomas Muenzer and his party.
Already the Taborites showed a kind of chiliastic community of property, but
this was a purely military measure. Only in the teachings of Muenzer did these
communist notions find expression as the desires of a vital section of society.
Through him they were formulated with a certain definiteness, and were
afterwards found in every great convulsion of the people, until gradually they
merged with the modern proletarian movement. Something similar we observe in
the Middle Ages, where the struggles of the free peasants against increasing
feudal domination merged with the struggles of the serfs and bondsmen for the
complete abolition of the feudal system.</p>
<p>While the first of the three large camps, the conservative Catholics,
embraced all the elements interested in maintaining the existing imperial
power, the ecclesiastical and a section of the lay princes, the richer
nobility, the prelates and the city patricians — the middle-class
moderate Lutheran reform gathered under its banner all the propertied elements
of the opposition, the mass of the lower nobility, the middle-class and even a
portion of the lay princes who hoped to enrich themselves through the
confiscation of the church estates and to seize the opportunity for
establishing greater independence from the empire. As to the peasants and
plebeians, they grouped themselves around the revolutionary party whose demands
and doctrines found their boldest expression in Muenzer.</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="Martin Luther" border="0" hspace="20" src="pwg2b.gif" vspace="20"/> <a href="notes.html#13" target=_blank>Luther</a> and Muenzer, in their
doctrines, in their characters, in their actions, accurately embodied the
tenets of their separate parties.</p>
<p>Between 1517 and 1525, Luther had gone through the same transformations as
the German constitutionalists between 1846 and 1849. This has been the case
with every middle-class party which, having marched for a while at the head of
the movement, has been overwhelmed by the plebeian-proletarian party pressing
from the rear.</p>
<p>When in 1517 opposition against the dogmas and the organisation of the
Catholic church was first raised by Luther, it still had no definite character.
Not exceeding the demands of the earlier middle-class heresy, it did not
exclude any trend of opinion which went further. It could not do so because the
first moment of the struggle demanded that all opposing elements be united, the
most aggressive revolutionary energy be utilised. and the totality of the
existing heresies fighting the Catholic orthodoxy be represented. In a similar
fashion, our liberal bourgeoisie of 1847 were still revolutionary. They called
themselves socialists and communists, and they discussed emancipation of the
working class. Luther's sturdy peasant nature asserted itself in the stormiest
fashion in the first period of his activities. "If the raging madness [of the
Roman churchmen] were to continue, it seems to me no better counsel and remedy
could be found against it than that kings and princes apply force, arm
themselves, attack those evil people who have poisoned the entire world, and
once and for all make an end to this game, with <i>arms, not with words</i>.
If thieves are being punished with swords, murderers with ropes, and heretics
with fire, why do we not seize, with arms in hand, all those evil teachers of
perdition, those popes, bishops, cardinals, and the entire crew of Roman Sodom?
Why do we not wash our hands in their blood?"</p>
<p>This revolutionary ardour did not last long. The lightning thrust by Luther
caused a conflagration. A movement started among the entire German people. In
his appeals against the clergy, in his preaching of Christian freedom, peasants
and plebeians perceived the signal for insurrection. Likewise, the moderate
middle-class and a large section of the lower nobility joined him, and even
princes were drawn into the torrent. While the former believed the day had come
in which to wreak vengeance upon all their oppressors, the latter only wished
to break the power of the clergy, the dependence upon Rome, the Catholic
hierarchy, and to enrich themselves through the confiscation of church
property. The parties became separated from each other, and each found a
different spokesman. Luther had to choose between the two. Luther, the protégé
of the Elector of Saxony, the respected professor of Wittenberg who had become
powerful and famous overnight, the great man who was surrounded by a coterie of
servile creatures and flatterers, did not hesitate a moment. He dropped the
popular elements of the movement, and joined the train of the middle-class, the
nobility and the princes. Appeals to war of extermination against Rome were
heard no more. Luther was now preaching <i>peaceful progress</i> and passive
resistance. (Cf. <i>To the nobility of the German nation,</i> 1520, etc.)
Invited by Hutten to visit him and Sickingen in the castle of Ebern, the centre
of the noble conspiracy against clergy and princes, Luther replied<i>: "I
should not like to see the Gospel defended by force and bloodshed. </i>The
world was conquered by the Word, the Church has maintained itself by the Word,
the Church will come into its own again through the Word, and as Antichrist
gained ascendancy without violence, so without violence he will fall."</p>
<p>Out of this turn of mind, or, to be more exact, out of this definite
delineation of Luther's policy, sprang that policy bartering and haggling over
institutions and dogmas to be retained or reformed, that ugly diplomatising,
conceding, intriguing and compromising, the result of which was the <a href="notes.html#13" target=_blank>Augsburg Confession</a>, the final draft of the
constitution the reformed middle-class church. It was the same petty trading
which, in the political field, repeated itself ad <i>nauseam</i> in the
recent German national assemblies, unity gatherings, chambers of revision, and
in the parliaments of Erfurt. The Philistine middle-class character of the
official reformation appeared in these negotiations most clearly.</p>
<p>There were valid reasons why Luther, now the recognised representative of
middle-class reform, chose to preach lawful progress. The mass of the cities
had joined the cause of moderate reform; the lower nobility became more and
more devoted to it; one section of the princes joined it, another vacillated.
Success was almost certain at least in a large portion of Germany. Under
continued peaceful development the other regions could not in the long run
withstand the pressure of moderate opposition. Violent convulsions, on the
other hand, were bound to result in a conflict between the moderates and the
extreme plebeian and peasant party, thus to alienate the princes, the nobility,
and a number of cities from the movement and to leave open the alternative of
either the middle-class party being overshadowed by the peasants and plebeians,
or the entire movement being crushed by Catholic restoration. How middle-class
parties, having achieved the slightest victory, attempt to steer their way
between the Scylla of revolution and the Charybdis of restoration by means of
lawful progress, we have had occasions enough to observe in the events of
recent times.</p>
<p>It was in the nature of the then prevailing social and political conditions
that the results of every change were advantageous to the princes, increasing
their power. Thus it came about that the middle-class reform, having parted
ways with the plebeian and peasant elements, fell more and more under the
control of the reform princes. Luther's subservience to them increased, and the
people knew very well what they were doing when they accused him of having
become a slave of the princes as were all the others, and when they pursued him
with stones in Orlamuende.</p>
<p>When the peasant war broke out, becoming more predominant in regions with
Catholic nobility and princes, Luther strove to maintain a conciliatory
position. He resolutely attacked the governments. He said it was due to their
oppression that the revolts had started, that not the peasants alone were
against them, but God as well. On the other hand, he also said that the revolt
was ungodly and against the Gospel. He advised both parties to yield, to reach
a peaceful understanding.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these sincere attempts at conciliation, however, the revolt
spread rapidly over large areas, including such sections as were dominated by
Protestant Lutheran princes, nobles and cities, and rapidly outgrew the
middle-class "circumspect" reform. The most determined faction of the
insurgents under Muenzer opened their headquarters in Luther's very proximity,
in Thuringia. A few more successes, and Germany would have been one big
conflagration, Luther would have been surrounded, perhaps piked as a traitor,
and middle-class reform would have been swept away by the tides of a
peasant-plebeian revolution. There was no more time for circumspection. In the
face of the revolution, all old animosities were forgotten. Compared with the
hordes of peasants, the servants of the Roman Sodom were innocent lambs,
sweet-tempered children of God. Burgher and prince, noble and clergyman, Luther
and the pope united "against the murderous and plundering hordes of the
peasants." "They should be knocked to pieces, strangled and stabbed, secretly
and openly, by everybody who can do it, just as one must kill a mad dog!"
Luther cried. "Therefore, dear gentlemen, hearken here, save there, stab,
knock, strangle them at will, and if thou diest, thou art blessed; no better
death canst thou ever attain." No false mercy was to be practised in relation
to the peasants. "Whoever hath pity on those whom God pities not, whom He
wishes punished and destroyed, shall be classed among the rebellious himself."
Later, he said, the peasants would learn to thank God when they had to give
away one cow in order that they might enjoy the other in peace. Through the
revolution, he said, the princes would learn the spirit of the mob which could
reign by force only. "The wise man says: <i>'Cibus, onus et virgam
asino.'</i> The heads of the peasants are full of chaff. They do not hearken
to the Word, and they are senseless, so they must hearken to the virga and the
gun, and this is only just. We must pray for them that they obey. Where they do
not, there should not be much mercy. Let the guns roar among them, or else they
will make it a thousand times worse."</p>
<p>It is the same language that was used by our late socialist and
philanthropic bourgeoisie, when, after the March days the proletariat also
demanded its share in the fruits of victory.</p>
<p>Luther had given the plebeian movement a powerful weapon — a
translation of the Bible. Through the Bible, he contrasted feudal Christianity
of his time with moderate Christianity of the first century. In opposition to
decaying feudal society, he held up the picture of another society which knew
nothing of the ramified and artificial feudal hierarchy. The peasants had made
extensive use of this weapon against the forces of the princes, the nobility,
and the clergy. Now Luther turned the same weapon against the peasants,
extracting from the Bible a veritable hymn to the authorities ordained by God
— a feat hardly exceeded by any lackey of absolute monarchy. Princedom by
the grace of God, passive resistance, even serfdom, were being sanctioned by
the Bible. Thus Luther repudiated not only the peasant insurrection but even
his own revolt against religious and lay authority. He not only betrayed the
popular movement to the princes, but the middle-class movement as well.</p>
<p>Need we mention other bourgeois who recently gave us examples of repudiating
their own past?</p>
<p><img align="left" alt="Thomas Munzer" border="1" height="396" hspace="20" src="pwg2c.gif" vspace="20" width="300"/> Let us now compare the plebeian
revolutionary, Muenzer, with the middle-class reformist, Luther.</p>
<p>Thomas Muenzer was born in Stolberg, in the Harz, in 1498. It is said that
his father died on the scaffold, a victim of the wilfulness of the Count of
Stolberg. In his fifteenth year, Muenzer organised at the Halle school a secret
union against the Archbishop of Magdeburg and the Roman Church in general. His
scholarly attainments in the theology of his time brought him early the
doctor's degree and the position of chaplain in a Halle nunnery. Here he began
to treat the dogmas and rites of the church with the greatest contempt. At mass
he omitted the words of the transubstantiation, and ate, as Luther said, the
almighty gods unconsecrated. Mediaeval mystics, especially the chiliastic works
of <a href="notes.html#14" target=_blank>Joachim of Calabria</a>, were the main subject of his
studies. It seemed to Muenzer that the millennium and the day of judgment over
the degenerated church and the corrupted world, as announced and pictured by
that mystic, had come in the form of the Reformation and the general
restlessness of his time. He preached in his neighbourhood with great success.
In 1520 he went to Zwickau as the first evangelist preacher. There he found one
of those dreamy chiliastic sects which continued their existence in many
localities, hiding behind an appearance of humility and detachment, the rankly
growing opposition of the lower strata of society against existing conditions,
and with the growth of agitation, beginning to press to the foreground more
boldly and with more endurance. It was the sect of the Anabaptists headed by <a href="notes.html#15" target=_blank>Nicolas Storch</a>. The Anabaptists preached the approach
of the Day of judgment and of the millennium; they had "visions, convulsions,
and the spirit of prophecy." They soon came into conflict with the council of
Zwickau. Muenzer defended them, though he had never joined them
unconditionally, and had rather brought them under his own influence. The
council took decisive steps against them, they were compelled to leave the
city, and Muenzer departed with them. This was at the end of 1521.</p>
<p>He then went to Prague and, in order to gain ground, attempted to join the
remnants of the Hussite movement. His proclamations, however, made it necessary
for him to flee Bohemia also. In 1522, he became preacher at Altstedt in
Thuringia. Here he started with reforming the cult. Before even Luther dared to
go so far, he entirely abolished the Latin language, and ordered the entire
Bible, not only the prescribed Sunday Gospels and epistles, to be read to the
people. At the same time, he organised propaganda in his locality. People
flocked to him from all directions, and soon Altstedt became the centre of the
popular anti-priest movement of entire Thuringia.</p>
<p>Muenzer at that time was still theologian before everything else. He
directed his attacks almost exclusively against the priests. He did not,
however, preach quiet debate and peaceful progress, as Luther had begun to do
at that time, but he continued the early violent preachments of Luther,
appealing to the princes of Saxony and the people to rise in arms against the
Roman priests. "Is it not Christ who said: 'I have come to bring, not peace,
but the sword'? What can you [the princes of Saxony] do with that sword? You
can do only one thing: If you wish to be the servants of God, you must drive
out and destroy the evil ones who stand in the way of the Gospel. Christ
ordered very earnestly (Luke, 19, 27): 'But these mine enemies, that would not
that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.' Do not
resort to empty assertions that the power of God could do it without aid of our
sword, since then it would have to rust in its sheath. We must destroy those
who stand in the way of God's revelation, we must do it mercilessly, as
Hezekiah, Cyrus, Josiah, Daniel and Elias destroyed the priests of Baal, else
the Christian Church will never come back to its origins. We must uproot the
weeds in God's vineyard at the time when the crops are ripe. God said in the
Fifth Book of Moses, 7, 'Thou shalt not show mercy unto the idolators, but ye
shall break down their altars, dash in pieces their graven images and burn them
with fire that I shall not be wroth at you.'" But these appeals to the princes
were of no avail, whereas the revolutionary agitation among the people grew day
by day. Muenzer, whose ideas became more definitely shaped and more courageous,
now definitely relinquished the middle-class reformation, and at the same time
appeared as a direct political agitator.</p>
<p>His theologic-philosophic doctrine attacked all the main points not only of
Catholicism but of Christianity as such. Under the cloak of Christian forms, he
preached a kind of pantheism, which curiously resembles the modern speculative
mode of contemplation, and at times even taught open atheism. He repudiated the
assertion that the Bible was the only infallible revelation. The only living
revelation, he said, was reason, a revelation which existed among all peoples
at all times. To contrast the Bible with reason, he maintained, was to kill the
spirit by the latter, for the Holy Spirit of which the Bible spoke was not a
thing outside of us; the Holy Spirit was our reason. Faith, he said, was
nothing else but reason become alive in man, therefore, he said, pagans could
also have faith. Through this faith, through reason come to life, man became
godlike and blessed, he said. Heaven was to be sought in this life, not beyond,
and it was, according to Muenzer, the task of the believers to establish
Heaven, the kingdom of God, here on earth. As there is no Heaven in the beyond,
so there is no Hell in the beyond, and no damnation, and there are no devils
but the evil desires and cravings of man. Christ, he said, was a man, as we
are, a prophet and a teacher, and his "Lord's Supper" is nothing but a plain
meal of commemoration wherein bread and wine are being consumed with mystic
additions.</p>
<p>Muenzer preached these doctrines mostly in a covert fashion, under the cloak
of Christian phraseology which the new philosophy was compelled to utilise for
some time. The fundamental heretic idea, however, is easily discernible in all
his writings, and it is obvious that the biblical cloak was for him of much
less importance than it was for many a disciple of Hegel in modern times.
Still, there is a distance of three hundred years between Muenzer and modern
philosophy.</p>
<p>Muenzer's political doctrine followed his revolutionary religious
conceptions very closely, and as his theology reached far beyond the current
conceptions of his time, so his political doctrine went beyond existing social
and political conditions. As Muenzer's philosophy of religion touched upon
atheism, so his political programme touched upon communism, and there is more
than one communist sect of modern times which, on the eve of the February
Revolution, did not possess a theoretical equipment as rich as that of Muenzer
of the Sixteenth Century. His programme, less a compilation of the demands of
the then existing plebeians than a genius's anticipation of the conditions for
the emancipation of the proletarian element that had just begun to develop
among the plebeians, demanded the immediate establishment of the kingdom of
God, of the prophesied millennium on earth. This was to be accomplished by the
return of the church to its origins and the abolition of all institutions that
were in conflict with what Muenzer conceived as original Christianity, which,
in fact, was the idea of a very modern church. By the kingdom of God, Muenzer
understood nothing else than a state of society without class differences,
without private property, and without superimposed state powers opposed to the
members of society. All existing authorities, as far as they did not submit and
join the revolution, he taught, must be overthrown, all work and all property
must be shared in common, and complete equality must be introduced. In his
conception, a union of the people was to be organised to realise this
programme, not only throughout Germany, but throughout entire Christendom.
Princes and nobles were to be invited to join, and should they refuse, the
union was to overthrow or kill them, with arms in hand, at the first
opportunity.</p>
<p>Muenzer immediately set to work to organise the union. His preachings
assumed a still more militant character. He attacked, not only the clergy, but
with equal passion the princes, the nobility and the patricians. He pictured in
burning colours the existing oppression, and contrasted it with the vision of
the millennium of social republican equality which he created out of his
imagination. He published one revolutionary pamphlet after another, sending
emissaries in all directions, while he personally organised the union in
Altstedt and its vicinity.</p>
<p>The first fruit of this propaganda was the destruction St. Mary's Chapel in
Mellerbach near Altstedt, according to the command of the Bible (Deut. 7, 5):
"Ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and hew
down their Asherim, and burn their graven images with fire." The princes of
Saxony came in person to Altstedt quell the upheaval, and they called Muenzer
to the castle. There he delivered a sermon, which they had never heard from
Luther, "that easy living flesh of Wittenberg," Muenzer called him. He insisted
that the ungodly rulers, especially the priests and monks who treated the
Gospel as heresy, must be killed; for confirmation he referred to the New
Testament. The ungodly have no right to live, he said, save by the mercy of the
chosen ones. If the princes would not exterminate the ungodly, he asserted, God
would take their sword from them because the right to wield the sword belongs
to the community. The source of the evil of usury, thievery and robbery, he
said, were the princes and the masters who had taken all creatures into their
private possession — the fishes in the water, the birds in the air, the
plants in the soil. And the usurpers, he said, still preached to the poor the
commandment, "Thou shalt not steal," while they grabbed everything, and robbed
and crushed the peasant and the artisan. "When, however, one of the latter
commits the slightest transgression," he said, "he has to hang, and Dr. Liar
says to all this: Amen." The masters themselves created a situation, he argued,
in which the poor man was forced to become their enemy. If they did not remove
the causes of the upheaval, how could things improve in times to come? he
asked. "Oh, my dear gentlemen, how the Lord will smite with an iron rod all
these old pots! When I say so, I am considered rebellious. So be it!" (Cf.
Zimmermann's <i>Peasant War,</i> II, p. 75.)</p>
<p>Muenzer had the sermon printed. His Altstedt printer was punished by Duke
Johann of Saxony with banishment. His own writings were to be henceforth
subjected to the censorship of the ducal government in Weimar. But he paid no
heed to this order. He immediately published a very inciting paper in the
imperial city of Muehlhausen, wherein he admonished the people "to widen the
hole so that all the world may see and comprehend who our fools are who have
blasphemously turned our Lord into a painted mannikin." He concluded with the
following words: "All the world must suffer a big jolt. The game will be such
that the ungodly will be thrown off their seats and the downtrodden will rise."
As a motto, Thomas Muenzer, "the man with the hammer," wrote the following on
the title page: "Beware, I have put my words into thy mouth; I have lifted thee
above the people and above the empires that thou mayest uproot, destroy,
scatter and overthrow, and that thou mayest build and plant. A wall of iron
against the kings, princes, priests, and for the people hath been erected. Let
them fight, for victory is wondrous, and the strong and godless tyrants will
perish."</p>
<p>The breach between Muenzer and Luther with his party had taken place long
before that. Luther himself was compelled to accept some church reforms which
were introduced by Muenzer without consulting him. Luther watched Muenzer's
activities with the nettled distrust of a moderate reformer towards an
energetic far-aiming radical. Already in the spring of 1524, in a letter to
Melanchthon, that model of a hectic stay-at-home Philistine, Muenzer wrote that
he and Luther did not understand the movement at all. They were seeking, he
said, to choke it by adherence to the letter of the Bible,, and their doctrine
was worm-eaten. "Dear brethren," he wrote, "stop your delaying and hesitating.
The time has come, the summer is knocking at our doors. Do not keep friendship
with the ungodly who prevent the Word from exercising its full force. Do not
flatter your princes in order that you may not perish With them. Ye tender,
bookish scholars, do not be wroth, for I cannot do otherwise."</p>
<p>Luther had more than once invited Muenzer to an open debate. The latter,
however, being always ready to accept battle in the presence of the people, did
not have the slightest desire to plunge into a theological squabble before the
partisan public of the Wittenberg University. He had no desire "to bring the
testimony of the spirit before the high school of learning exclusively." If
Luther was sincere, he wrote, let him use his influence to stop the chicaneries
against his, Muenzer's, printers, and to lift the censorship in order that
their controversy might be freely fought out in the press.</p>
<p>When the above-mentioned revolutionary brochure appeared, Luther openly
denounced Muenzer. In his "Letter to the Princes of Saxony Against the
Rebellious Spirit," he declared Muenzer to be an instrument of Satan, and
demanded of the princes to intervene, and drive the instigators of the upheaval
out of the country, since, he said, they did not confine themselves to
preaching their evil doctrine, but incited to insurrection, to violent lawless
action against the authorities.</p>
<p>On August 1st, Muenzer was compelled to appear before the princes in the
castle of Weimar, to defend himself against the accusation of incendiary
machinations. There were highly compromising facts quoted against him; his
secret union had been traced; his hand was discovered in the Organisation of
the pitmen and the peasants. He was being threatened with banishment. Upon
returning to AItstedt, he learned Duke Georg of Saxony demanded his
extradition. Union letters in his handwriting had been intercepted, wherein he
called Georg's subjects to armed resistance against the enemies of the Gospel.
The council would have extradited him had he not left the city.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the rising agitation among the peasants and the plebeians
had enormously lightened Muenzer's task of propaganda. In the person of the
Anabaptists he found invaluable agents. This sect, having no definite dogmas,
held together by common opposition against all ruling classes and by the common
symbol of second baptism, ascetic in their mode of living, untiring, fanatic
and intrepid in propaganda, had grouped itself more closely around Muenzer.
Made homeless by constant persecutions, its members wandered over the length
and breadth of Germany, announcing everywhere the new gospel wherein Muenzer
had made clear to them their own demands and wishes. Numberless Anabaptists
were put on the rack, burned or otherwise executed. But the courage and
endurance of these emissaries were unshaken, and the success of their
activities amidst the rapidly rising agitation of the people was enormous. That
was one of the reasons why, on his flight from Thuringia, Muenzer found the
ground prepared wherever he turned.</p>
<p>In Nuernberg, a peasant revolt had been nipped in the bud a month previous.
Here Muenzer conducted his propaganda under cover. Soon there appeared persons
who defended his most audacious theological doctrines of the non-obligatory
power of the Bible and the meaninglessness of sacraments, declaring Christ to
have been a mere man, and the power of lay authorities to be ungodly. "We see
there Satan stalking, the spirit of Altstedt!" Luther exclaimed. In Nuernberg,
Muenzer printed his reply to Luther. He accused him of flattering the princes
and supporting the reactionary party by his moderate position. "The people will
free themselves in spite of everything," he wrote, "and then the fate of Dr.
Luther will be that of a captive fox." The city council ordered the paper
confiscated, and Muenzer was compelled to leave the city. From there he went
through Suabia to Alsace, then to Switzerland, and then back to the Upper Black
Forest where the insurrection had started several months before, precipitated
largely by the Anabaptist emissaries. There is no doubt that this propaganda
trip of Muenzer's added much to the organisation of the people's party, to a
clear formulation of its demands and to the final general outbreak of the
insurrection in April, 1525. It was through this trip that the dual nature of
Muenzer's activities became more and more pronounced — on the one hand,
his propaganda among the people whom he approached in the only language then
comprehensible to the masses, that of religious prophecy; on the other hand,
his contact with the initiated, to whom he could disclose his ultimate aims.
Even previous to this journey he had grouped around himself in Thuringia a
circle of the most determined persons, not only from among the people, but also
from among the lower clergy, a circle whom he had put at the head of the secret
Organisation. Now he became the centre of the entire revolutionary movement of
southwest Germany, organising connections between Saxony and Thuringia through
Franconia and Suabia up to Alsace and the Swiss frontier and counting among his
disciples and the heads of the Organisation such men as Hubmaier of Waldshut,
Conrad Grebel of Zurich, Franz Rabmann of Griessen, Schappelar of Memmingen,
Jakob Wehe of Leipheim, and Dr. Mantel in Stuttgart, the most revolutionary of
priests. He kept himself mostly in Griessen on the Schaffhausen frontier,
undertaking journeys through the Hegau, Klettgau, etc. The bloody persecutions
undertaken by the alarmed princes and masters everywhere against this new
plebeian heresy, aided not a little in fanning the rebellious spirit and
closing the ranks of the Organisation. In this way, Muenzer passed five months
in upper Germany. When the outbreak of the general movement was at hand, he
returned to Thuringia, where he wished to lead the movement personally. There
we will find him later.</p>
<p>We shall see how truly the character and the behaviour of the two party
heads reflected the position of their respective parties. Luther's indecision,
his fear of the movement, assumed serious proportions; his cowardly servility
towards the princes corresponded closely to the hesitating, vacillating policy
of the middle-classes. The revolutionary energy and decisiveness of Muenzer, on
the other hand, was seen in the most advanced faction of the plebeians and
peasants. The difference was that while Luther confined himself to an
expression of the ideas and wishes of a majority of his class and thereby
acquired among it a very cheap popularity, Muenzer, on the contrary, went far
beyond the immediate ideas and demands of the plebeians and peasants,
organising out of the then existing revolutionary elements a party, which, as
far as it stood on the level of his ideas and shared his energy, still
represented only a small minority of the insurgent masses.</p>

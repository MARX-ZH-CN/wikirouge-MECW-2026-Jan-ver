<p class="title">The Peasant War in Germany by Frederick Engels</p>
<h1>The Twelve Articles of the Peasants</h1>
<p class="fst">The fundamental and correct chief articles of all the peasants
and of those subject to ecclesiastical lords, relating to these matters in
which they feel themselves aggrieved.</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i><b>M</b> cccc, quadratum, Ix et duplicatum</i><br>
<i><b>V</b> cum transit, christiana secta peribit.</i><br>
<i>Peace to the Christian Reader and the Grace of God through Christ.</i></p>
<p class="fst">There are many evil writings put forth of late which take
occasion, on account of the assembling of the peasants, to cast scorn upon the
gospel, saying: Is this the fruit of the new teaching, that no one should obey
but all should everywhere rise in revolt and rush together to reform or perhaps
destroy altogether the authorities, both ecclesiastic and lay? The articles
below shall answer these godless and criminal fault-finders, and serve in the
first place to remove the reproach from the word of God, and in the second
place to give a Christian excuse for the disobedience or even the revolt of the
entire Peasantry. In the first place the Gospel is not the cause of revolt and
disorder, since it is the message of Christ, the promised Messiah, the Word of
Life, teaching only love, peace, patience and concord. Thus, all who believe in
Christ should learn to be loving, peaceful, long-suffering and harmonious. This
is the foundation of all the articles of the peasants (as Will be seen) who
accept the Gospel and live according to it. How then can the evil reports
declare the Gospel to be a cause of revolt and disobedience? That the authors
of the evil reports and the enemies of the Gospel oppose themselves to these
demands is due, not to the Gospel, but to the Devil, the worst enemy of the
Gospel, who causes this opposition by raising doubts in the minds of his
followers, and thus the word of God, which teaches love, peace and concord, is
overcome. In the second place, it is clear that the peasants demand that this
Gospel be taught them as a guide in life and they ought not to be called
disobedient or disorderly. Whether God grant the peasants (earnestly wishing to
live according to His word) their requests or no, who shall find fault with the
will of the Most High? Who shall meddle in His judgments or oppose his majesty?
Did be not hear the children of Israel when they called upon Him and saved them
out of the hands of Pharaoh? Can He not save His own to-day? Yes, He will save
them and that speedily. Therefore, Christian reader, read the following
articles with care and then judge. Here follow the articles:</p>
<p class="fst"><i>The First Article</i>. — First, it is our humble
petition and desire, as also our will and resolution, that in the future we
should have power and authority so that each community should choose and
appoint a pastor, and that we should have the right to depose him should he
conduct himself improperly. The pastor thus chosen should teach us the Gospel
pure and simple, without any addition, doctrine or ordinance of man. For to
teach us continually the true faith will lead us to pray God that through His
grace this faith may increase within us and become part of us. For if His grace
work not within us we remain flesh and blood, which availeth nothing; since the
Scripture clearly teaches that only through true faith can we come to God. Only
through His mercy can we become holy. Hence such a guide and pastor is
necessary and in this fashion grounded upon the Scriptures.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>The Second Article</i>. — According as the just tithe
is established by the Old Testament and fulfilled in the New, we are ready and
willing to pay the fair tithe of grain. The word of God plainly provided that
in giving according to right to God and distributing to His people the services
of a pastor are required. We will that, for the future, our church provost,
whomsoever the community may appoint, shall gather and receive this tithe. From
this he shall give to the pastor, elected by the whole community, a decent and
sufficient maintenance for him and his, as shall seem right to the whole
community (or, with the knowledge of the community). What remains over shall be
given to the poor of the place, as the circumstances and the general opinion
demand. Should anything farther remain, let it be kept, lest any one should
have to leave the country from poverty. Provision should also be made from this
surplus to avoid laying any land tax on the poor. In case one or more villages
themselves have sold their tithes on account of want, and each village has
taken action as a whole, the buyer should not suffer loss, but we will that
some proper agreement be reached with him for the repayment of the sum by the
village with due interest. But those who have tithes which they have not
purchased from a village, but which were appropriated by their ancestors,
should not, and ought not, to be paid anything farther by the village which
shall apply its tithes to the support of the pastors elected as above
indicated, or to solace the poor as is taught by the Scriptures. The small
tithes, whether ecclesiastical or lay, we will not pay at an, for the Lord God
created cattle for the free use of man. We will not, therefore, pay farther an
unseemly tithe which is of man's invention.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>The Third Article</i>. — It has been the custom
hitherto for men to hold us as their own property, which is pitiable enough,
considering that Christ has delivered and redeemed us all, without exception,
by the shedding of His precious blood, the lowly as well as the great.
Accordingly, it is consistent with Scripture that we should be free and wish to
be so. Not that we would wish to be absolutely free and under no authority. God
does not teach us that we should lead a disorderly life in the lusts of the
flesh, but that we should love the Lord our God and our neighbour. We would
gladly observe all this as God has commanded us in the celebration of the
communion. He has not commanded us not to obey the authorities, but rather that
we should be humble, not only towards those in authority, but towards every
one. We are thus ready to yield obedience according to God's law to our elected
and regular authorities in all proper things becoming to a Christian. We,
therefore, take it for granted that you will release us from serfdom as true
Christians, unless it should be shown us from the Gospel that we are serfs.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>The Fourth Article</i>. — In the fourth place it has
been the custom heretofore, that no poor man should be allowed to catch venison
or wild fowl or fish in flowing water, which seems to us quite unseemly and
unbrotherly as well as selfish and not agreeable to the word of God. In some
places the authorities preserve the game to our great annoyance and loss,
recklessly permitting the unreasoning animals to destroy to no purpose our
crops which God suffers to grow for the use of man, and yet we must remain
quiet. This is neither godly or neighbourly. For when God created man he gave
him dominion over all the animals, over the birds of the air and over the fish
in the water. Accordingly it is our desire if a man holds possession of waters
that he should prove from satisfactory documents that his right has been
unwittingly acquired by purchase. We do not wish to take it from him by force,
but his rights should be exercised in a Christian and brotherly fashion. But
whosoever cannot produce such evidence should surrender his claim with good
grace.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>The Fifth Article</i>. — In the fifth place we are
aggrieved in the matter of wood-cutting, for the noble folk have appropriated
all the woods to themselves alone. If a poor man requires wood he must pay
double for it (or, perhaps, two pieces of money). It is our opinion in regard
to wood which has fallen into the hands of a lord whether spiritual or
temporal, that unless it was duly purchased it should revert again to the
community. It should, moreover, be free to every member of the community to
help himself to such fire-wood as he needs in his home. Also, if a man requires
wood for carpenter's purposes he should have it free, but with the knowledge of
a person appointed by the community for that purpose. Should, however, no such
forest be at the disposal of the community let that which has been duly bought
be administered in a brotherly and Christian manner. If the forest, although
unfairly appropriated in the first instance, was later duly sold let the matter
be adjusted in a friendly spirit and according to the Scriptures.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>The Sixth Article</i>. — Our sixth complaint is in
regard the excessive services demanded of us which are increase from day to
day. We ask that this matter be properly looked into so that we shall not
continue to be oppressed in this way, but that some gracious consideration be
given us, since our forefathers were required only to serve according to the
word of God.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>The Seventh Article.</i> — Seventh, we will not
hereafter allow ourselves to be farther oppressed by our lords, but will let
them demand only what is just and proper according to the word of the agreement
between the lord and the peasant. The lord should no longer try to force more
services or other dues from the peasant without payment, but permit the peasant
to enjoy his holding in peace and quiet. The peasant should, however, help the
lord when it is necessary, and at proper times when it will not be
disadvantageous to the peasant and for a suitable payment.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>The Eighth Article.</i> — In the eighth place, we are
greatly burdened by holdings which cannot support the rent exacted from them.
The peasants suffer loss in this way and are ruined, and we ask that the lords
may appoint persons of honour to inspect these holdings, and fix a rent in
accordance with justice, so that the peasants shall not work for nothing, since
the labourer is worthy of his hire.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>The Ninth Article</i>. — In the ninth place, we are
burdened with a great evil in the constant making of new laws. We are not
judged according to the offense, but sometimes with great ill will, and
sometimes much too leniently. In our opinion we should be judged according to
the old written law so that the case shall be decided according to its merits,
and not with partiality.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>The Tenth Article</i>. — In the tenth place, we are
aggrieved by the appropriation by individuals of meadows and fields which at
one time belonged to a community. These we will take again into our own hands.
It may, however, happen that the land was rightfully purchased. When, however,
the land has unfortunately been purchased in this way, some brotherly
arrangement should be made according to circumstances.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>The Eleventh Article</i>. — In the eleventh place we
will entirely abolish the due called <i>Todfall</i> (that is, heriot) and
will no longer endure it, nor allow widows and orphans to be thus shamefully
robbed against God's will, and in violation of justice and right, as has been
done in many places, and by those who should shield and protect them. These
have disgraced and despoiled us, and although they had little authority they
assumed it. God will suffer this no more, but it shall be wholly done away
with, and for the future no man shall be bound to give little or much.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>Conclusion.</i> — In the twelfth place it is our
conclusion and final resolution, that if any one or more of the articles here
set forth should not be in agreement with the word of God, as we think they
are, such article we will willingly recede from when it is proved really to be
against the word of God by a clear explanation of the Scripture. Or if articles
should now be conceded to us that are hereafter discovered to be unjust, from
that hour they shall be dead and null and without force. Likewise, if more
complaints should be discovered which are based upon truth and the Scriptures
and relate to offenses against God and our neighbour, we have determined to
reserve the right to present these also, and to exercise ourselves in all
Christian teaching. For this we shall pray God, since He can grant these, and
He alone. The peace of Christ abide with us all.</p>

<p class="title">The Campaign for the German Imperial Constitution, Engels
1850</p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p class="indentb" style="text-align: center;">Hecker, Struve, Blenker, Zitz
und Blum,<br>
Bringt die deutschen Fürsten um!</p>
<p>This refrain <span class="context">[Hecker, Struve, Blenker, Zitz and Blum,
slay the German princes!– Ed.]</span> which on every highway and in every
tavern from the Palatinate to the Swiss frontier rang out on the lips of the
South German "people's militia" to the well-known tune of "Surrounded by the
Sea", a mixture of chorale and barrel-organ–this refrain sums up the
whole character of the "magnificent uprising for the Imperial
Constitution".<sup class="enote"><a href="#134">[134]</a></sup> Here you have
in two lines their great men, their ultimate aims, their admirable staunchness,
their noble hatred for the "tyrants" and at the same time their entire insight
into the social and political situation.</p>
<p>Amidst all the movements and convulsions in Germany which followed in the
wake of the February Revolution and its subsequent development, the campaign
for the Imperial Constitution stands out owing to its classically German
character. Its occasion, its appearance, the way it conducted itself, its whole
course, were through and through German. In the same way as the June days of
1848 mark the degree of the social and political development of France, so the
campaign for the Imperial Constitution marks the degree of the social and
political development of Germany, and especially of South Germany. </p>
<p>The soul of the whole movement was the class of the <i>petty
bourgeoisie,</i> usually known as the <i>burghers,</i> and it is precisely
in Germany, and especially in South Germany, that this class is in
preponderance. It was the petty bourgeoisie which, in the "March Clubs",<sup class="enote"><a href="#135">[135]</a></sup> the democratic constitutional
clubs, the patriotic clubs, the multitude of so-called democratic press, swore
to the Imperial Constitution its Grutli oaths,<sup class="enote"><a href="#136">[136]</a></sup> as widespread as they were innocuous, and carried
on its fight against the "refractory" princes of which the only immediate
result was admittedly the elevating consciousness of having fulfilled one's
civic duty. It was the petty bourgeoisie, represented by the resolute and
so-called extreme Left of the Frankfurt Assembly, i.e. in particular by the
Stuttgart Parliament and the "Imperial Regency",<sup class="enote"><a href="#137">[137]</a></sup> which furnished the entire movement with its
official leadership; lastly, the petty bourgeoisie was dominant in the local
committees of the provincial diets, committees of public safety, provisional
governments and constituent assemblies which in Saxony, on the Rhine and in
South Germany won greater or lesser credit in the cause of the Imperial
Constitution.</p>
<p>It is most unlikely that the petty bourgeoisie, if left to its own devices,
would have gone outside the legal framework of lawful, peaceful and virtuous
struggle and taken up the musket and the paving-stone in place of the so-called
weapons of the spirit. The history of all political movements since 1830 in
Germany, as in France and England, shows that this class is invariably full of
bluster and loud protestations, at times even extreme as far as talking goes,
as long as it perceives no danger; faint-hearted, cautious and calculating as
soon as the slightest danger approaches; aghast, alarmed and wavering as soon
as the movement it provoked is seized upon and taken up seriously by other
classes; treacherous to the whole movement for the sake of its petty-bourgeois
existence as soon as there is any question of a struggle with weapons in hand
– and in the end, as a result of its indecisiveness, more often than not
cheated and ill-treated as soon as the reactionary side has achieved
victory.</p>
<p>Standing everywhere behind the petty bourgeoisie, however, are other classes
who take up the movement provoked by it and in its interest, give it a more
defined and energetic character and wherever possible seek to take it over: the
<i>proletariat</i> and a large part of the peasantry, to whom moreover the
more advanced section of the petty bourgeoisie usually attaches itself for a
while.</p>
<p>These classes, headed by the proletariat of the larger towns, took the
loudly protested assurances in favour of the Imperial Constitution more
seriously than was to the liking of the petty-bourgeois agitators. If the petty
bourgeois were prepared, as they swore at every moment, to stake "property and
life" <span class="context">[In the German original a paraphrase of "mit Gut
und Blut fur des Reichsgrundgesetz einzustehen" in the proclamation issued by
the Bavarian petty-bourgeois deputies in reply to the Bavarian King's refusal
to recognise the Imperial Constitution; the proclamation was published in the
<i>Kolnische Zeitung</i> No. 109, May 8, 1849.–Ed.]</span> for the
Imperial Constitution, the workers, and in many districts the peasants too,
were ready to do the same, but under the condition, admittedly unspoken but
perfectly understood by all parties, that after victory the petty bourgeoisie
would have to defend this same Imperial Constitution against these same workers
and peasants. These classes drove the petty bourgeoisie to an open break with
the existing state power. If they could not prevent their allies, with their
shopkeepers mentality, from betraying them even while the battle was still
going on, they at least had the satisfaction of seeing this treachery punished
after the victory of the counter-revolution by the counter-revolutionaries
themselves.</p>
<p>On the other hand at the beginning of the movement, the more resolute
section of the bigger and middle bourgeoisie likewise attached itself to the
petty bourgeoisie, just as we find in all earlier petty-bourgeois movements in
England and France. The bourgeoisie never rules in its entirety; apart from the
feudal castes which have still retained some degree of the political power,
even the big bourgeoisie itself splits, as soon as it has vanquished feudalism,
into a governing and an opposing party usually represented by the banks on the
one hand and the manufacturers on the other. The opposing, progressive section
of the big and middle bourgeoisie then has, against the ruling section, common
interests with the petty bourgeoisie and unites with it for a joint struggle.
In Germany, where the armed counter-revolution has restored the almost
exclusive rule of the army, the bureaucracy and the feudal nobility and where
the bourgeoisie, in spite of the continued existence of constitutional forms,
only plays a very subordinate and modest role, there are many more motives for
this alliance. For all that, however, the German bourgeoisie is also infinitely
more irresolute than its English and French counterparts and as soon as there
is the slightest chance of a return to anarchy, i.e. of the real, decisive
struggle, it retreats from the scene in fear and trembling. So also this time.
</p>
<p>Incidentally, the moment was not at all unfavourable for battle. In France
elections were at hand; whether they gave the majority to the monarchists or
the reds, they were bound to oust the centre parties of the Constituent
Assembly, strengthen the extreme parties and bring about through a popular
movement a speedy resolution of the intensified parliamentary struggle: in a
word, they were bound to bring about a <i>"journee".</i> <span class="context">[An "historic day".–Ed]</span> In Italy fighting was
going on under the walls of Rome, and the Roman Republic was holding out
against the French army of invasion. In Hungary the Magyars were pushing on
irresistibly; the imperial troops had been chased over the Waag and the Leitha;
in Vienna, where every day people imagined they could hear the roar of cannon,
the Hungarian revolutionary army was expected at any moment; in Galicia the
arrival of Dembinski with a Polish-Magyar army was imminent and the Russian
intervention, far from becoming dangerous to the Magyars, seemed much more
likely to transform the Hungarian struggle into a European one. Finally,
Germany was in a state of extreme ferment; the advances of the
counter-revolution, the growing insolence of the soldiery, the bureaucracy and
the nobility, the continually renewed betrayals by the old liberals in the
ministries and the rapid succession of broken promises on the part of the
princes precipitated into the arms of the active party whole sections of former
supporters of order.</p>
<p>In these circumstances the struggle broke out which we are about to describe
in the following passages.</p>
<p>The incompleteness and confusion that still prevails in the material, the
total unreliability of almost all the oral information that can be collected
and the purely personal designs that underlie every piece of writing so far
published about this struggle make it impossible to give a critical picture of
the whole course of events. In these circumstances we have no choice but to
restrict ourselves purely to recounting what we ourselves have seen and heard.
Fortunately this is quite enough to allow the character of the whole campaign
to emerge; and if, besides the movement in Saxony, we also lack personal
observation of Mieroslawski's campaign on the Neckar, perhaps the <i>Neue
Rheinische Zeitung</i> will soon find an opportunity of giving us the
necessary information at least as regards the latter.<sup class="enote"><a href="#138">[138]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many of the participants in the campaign for the Imperial Constitution are
still in prison. Some have managed to return home, others, still abroad, are
daily awaiting such an opportunity – and among them are by no means the
worst. The reader will understand the consideration we owe our comrades-in-arms
and find it natural if we remain silent about certain things; and many a one
who is now safely back home will not take it amiss if we also do not wish to
compromise him by narrating events in which he displayed truly magnificent
courage.</p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term"><a id="134"></a>134</span> The <i>Imperial Constitution</i>
was adopted by the Frankfurt National Assembly on March 28, 1849. While
proclaiming a number of civil liberties and introducing national central
institutions, the Constitution nevertheless shaped the united German state as a
monarchy. On March 28 the Prussian King Frerderick William IV was elected
"Emperor of the Germans" by the Frankfurt National Assembly. Prussian-oriented
liberal deputies of the Assembly in particular insisted on handing the imperial
crown to the Hohenzollerns. However, Frederick William IV refused to accept the
offer. Apart from the Prussian Government, those of almost all the larger
German states (including Saxony, Bavaria and Hanover) refused to recognise the
Constitution. Afraid of revolutionary action, liberals and democrats in the
Frankfurt National Assembly proved incapable of upholding the Constitution. The
people themselves were its sole defender, and in the spring and summer of 1849,
they started an armed struggle led by petty-bourgeois democrats. Despite its
limitations, the Constitution was seen by the people as the only remaining
achievement of the revolution. On May 3, an armed uprising broke out in Dresden
and later in a number of towns in Rhenish Prussia; however, these uprisings
were rapidly suppressed by troops. The most powerful struggle in support of the
Imperial Constitution developed in the Bavarian Palatinate and Baden, where
workers, urban petty bourgeoisie and peasants rose in its defence. They were
soon joined by military units, especially mounted units. In the middle of May
provisional governments were set up, Leopold, the Grand Duke of Baden, fled,
and the separation of the Palatinate from Bavaria was proclaimed. The
leadership of the movement, however, fell mainly into the hands of moderate
petty-bourgeois democrats, who were hesitant and refused to proclaim a
republic. They chose passive defensive tactics confining the movement to local
limits and preventing the uprising from spreading outside the Palatinate and
Baden. Nevertheless, the combined Palatinate-Baden insurgent army, in which
there were many workers' units, put up a strong resistance to the
Prussian-Bavarian-Wurttemberg troops who greatly exceeded the insurgents in
numbers and strength. The insurgents' last stronghold–Rastatt–fell
on July 23. The uprisings in the Palatinate and Baden in the spring and summer
of 1849 were the closing events of the German revolution. </p>
<!-- <a id="135"></a> -->
<p class="fst"><span class="term">135</span><a id="135"></a> The <i>March Association,</i>
thus named after the March 1848 revolution in Germany, was founded in Frankfurt
am Main at the end of November 1848 by Left-wing deputies to the Frankfurt
National Assembly and had branches in various towns in Germany. Frobel, Simon,
Wesendock, Eisenmann, Vogt and other petty-bourgeois democratic leaders of the
March associations confined themselves to revolutionary phrase-mongering and
showed indecision and inconsistency in the struggle against
counter-revolutionaries, for which Marx and Engels criticised them sharply. </p>
<!-- <a id="136"></a> -->
<p class="fst"><span class="term">136</span><a id="136"></a> The reference is to a legend of
the Swiss Confederation the origin of which dates back to the agreement between
the three mountain cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden in 1291. The legend
runs that representatives of the three cantons met in the Grutli (or Rutli)
meadow in 1307 and took an oath of loyalty in the joint struggle against
Austrian rule. </p>
<!--<a id="137"></a> -->
<p class="fst"><span class="term">137</span><a id="137"></a> The Left wing of the Frankfurt
National Assembly consisted of two factions: the Left (Robert Blum, Karl Vogt
and others) and the extreme Left, known as the radical-democratic party (Arnold
Ruge, Friedrich Wilhelm Schloffel, Franz Zitz, Samuel Truzschler and others),
which, in the main, represented the petty bourgeoisie, but was nevertheless
supported by a section of the German workers. The extreme Left vacillated and
took a halfway position on the basic problems of the German revolution -
abolition of the remnants of feudalism and unification of the country. In April
and May 1849, after the conservative and most of the liberal deputies had left
the Assembly, the Left and the extreme Left gained the majority. But they, too,
continued the policy of curbing the revolutionary actions of the masses. </p>
<p><i>The Regency of the Empire</i> was formed in Stuttgart on June 7 by what
remained of the Frankfurt National Assembly, instead of the Central Authority
headed by the Imperial Regent, Archduke John, who was openly
counter-revolutionary. The Regency consisted of five deputies representing the
Left faction (moderate democrats): Franz Raveaux, Karl Vogt, Ludwig Simon,
Friedrich Schuler, August Becher. They failed in their attempts to carry by
parliamentary means the Imperial Constitution that had been worked out by the
Frankfurt Assembly and rejected by the German princes: The Regency virtually
ceased its activities after the Frankfurt Assembly was finally dispersed on
June 18, 1849. Some of its former deputies emigrated to Switzerland. </p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term">138</span><a id="138"></a> Presumably Engels himself intended
to write this work to complement his essays on the campaign for the German
Imperial Constitution, but no article on this was ever published in the
<i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung. Politisch-okonomische Revue.</i></p>

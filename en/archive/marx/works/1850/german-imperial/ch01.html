<p class="title">The Campaign for the German Imperial Constitution, Frederick
Engels 1850</p>
<h1>I. Rhenish Prussia</h1>
<p>It will he remembered how the armed uprising for the Imperial Constitution
first broke out in <i>Dresden</i><sup class="enote"><a href="#139">[139]</a></sup> at the beginning of May. It is well known how the
Dresden barricade-fighters, supported by the rural population and betrayed by
the Leipzig philistines, were defeated by superior forces after six days'
fighting. They at no time had more than 2,500 combatants with a motley
collection of weapons and for their whole artillery two or three small mortars.
The royal troops consisted, apart from the Saxon battalions, of two regiments
of Prussians. They had cavalry, artillery, riflemen and a battalion equipped
with needle-guns <span class="context">[Dreyse Needle-gun, first breach loading
bolt-action rifle, introduced 1848]</span>. The royal troops appear to have
conducted themselves in an even more cowardly way in Dresden than elsewhere; at
the same time, however, it is clear that the men of Dresden fought more
courageously against these superior forces than was probably the case elsewhere
in the campaign for the Imperial Constitution. It must be added, however, that
street-fighting is something quite different from an engagement in the
field.</p>
<p>Berlin, disarmed and in a state of siege, remained quiet. Not once was the
railway torn up to hold up the Prussian reinforcements at Berlin. Breslau <span class="context">[The Polish name is Wroclaw.–Ed.]</span> attempted a
feeble barricade-fight <sup class="enote"><a href="#140">[140]</a></sup> for
which the government had long been prepared, and as a result the city only
ended up the more certainly under the dictatorship of the sabre. The rest of
North Germany, having no revolutionary centres, was paralysed. Only Rhenish
Prussia and South Germany could still be reckoned on, and in South Germany the
Palatinate already started to move just at that moment.</p>
<p>Since 1815 Rhenish Prussia has been considered one of the most progressive
provinces in Germany, and rightly so. It combines two advantages which are not
to be found in combination in any other part of Germany.</p>
<p>Rhenish Prussia shares with Luxembourg, Rhenish Hesse and the Palatinate the
advantage of having experienced since 1795 the French Revolution and the
social, administrative and legislative consolidation of its results under
Napoleon. When the revolutionary party in Paris succumbed, the armies carried
the revolution across the frontiers. Before these so recently liberated sons of
peasants not only the armies of the Holy Roman Empire<sup class="enote"><a href="#141">[141]</a></sup> but also the feudal rule of the nobility and the
priests fell to pieces. For two generations the left bank of the Rhine has no
longer known feudalism; the nobleman has been deprived of his privileges and
the landed property has passed from his hands and those of the church into the
hands of the peasants; the land has been divided up and the peasant is a free
landed proprietor as in France. In the towns, the guilds and the patriarchal
rule of the patricians disappeared ten years earlier than anywhere else in
Germany in the face of free competition, and the Napoleonic Code<sup class="enote"><a href="#142">[142]</a></sup> finally sanctioned the whole
changed situation by summing up all the revolutionary institutions.</p>
<p>Secondly, however, Rhenish Prussia possesses – and herein lies its
main advantage over the rest of the states on the left bank of the Rhine
– the most developed and diversified industry in the whole of Germany. In
the three administrative districts of Aachen, Cologne and Dusseldorf, almost
all branches of industry are represented: cotton, wool and silk industries of
all kinds, together with those branches dependent upon them such as bleaching,
textile printing and dyeing, iron-founding and engineering, are to be found
concentrated here, alongside mining, armaments manufacture and other metal
industries, within an area of a few square miles and employ a population of a
density unheard of in Germany. Directly adjoining the Rhine Province is the
iron and coal district of the Mark which provides it with a part of its raw
materials and from the industrial point of view belongs to it. The best
waterway in Germany, the proximity of the sea and the mineral wealth of the
region favour industry, which has also built numerous railways and is even now
daily further integrating its railway network. There is a mutual interaction
between this industry and an import and export trade, for Germany very
extensive, with all parts of the world, a considerable direct traffic with all
the great trading centres of the world market and a commensurate degree of
speculation in raw materials and railway shares. To sum up, the level of
industrial and commercial development in the Rhine Province is for Germany
unique, even if in world terms it is fairly insignificant.</p>
<p>The consequence of this industry – which also burgeoned under the
revolutionary rule of the French – and the trade connected with it is the
creation in Rhenish Prussia of a mighty industrial and commercial big
<i>bourgeoisie</i> and, in opposition to it, of a large industrial
<i>proletariat,</i> two classes which in the rest of Germany only exist in
isolated areas and in embryonic form but which almost exclusively dominate the
distinct political development of the Rhine Province.</p>
<p>Over the rest of the German states revolutionised by the French Rhenish
Prussia has the advantage of <i>industry</i> and over the rest of the German
industrial areas (Saxony and Silesia) the advantage of the <i>French
Revolution.</i> It is the only part of Germany whose social development has
almost reached the level of modern bourgeois society: developed industry,
extensive trade, accumulation of capital and free ownership of land; the
predominance in the towns of a strong bourgeoisie and a numerous proletariat
and in the countryside of a multitude of debt-ridden allotment peasants; rule
of the bourgeoisie over the proletariat by means of the wages system, over the
peasantry by means of the mortgage and over the petty bourgeoisie by means of
competition, and finally the sanctioning of bourgeois rule through the courts
of trade, the factory courts, the bourgeois jury and the entire body of
material legislation.</p>
<p>Is it easier now to understand the Rhinelander's hatred for everything that
is Prussian? Along with the Rhine Province Prussia incorporated the French
Revolution into its states and treated the Rhinelanders not only as a
subjugated and alien people but even as vanquished rebels. Far from developing
the Rhenish legislation in the spirit of the ever growing modern bourgeois
society, Prussia intended saddling the Rhinelanders with the pedantic, feudal,
philistine hotchpotch of Prussian Law,<sup class="enote"><a href="#143">[143]</a></sup> which was barely suitable any longer even for
Farther Pomerania.</p>
<p>The revolutionary change after February 1848 clearly showed the exceptional
position of the Rhine Province. It provided not only the Prussian but the whole
of the German bourgeoisie with its classical representatives,
<i>Camphausen</i> and <i>Hansemann,</i> and provided the German proletariat
with the sole organ in which it was championed not only in terms of fine words
or good will, but according to its true interests: the <i>Neue Rheinische
Zeitung. </i> How is it, then, that Rhenish Prussia for all that took so
little part in Germany's revolutionary movements?</p>
<p>It must not be forgotten that the 1830 movement in favour of a hollow
pettifogger's constitutionalism could not hope to interest Germany's Rhenish
bourgeoisie, who were busily engaged in much more real, industrial enterprises;
that, whereas people in the petty German states were still dreaming of a German
Empire, in Rhenish Prussia the proletariat was already beginning to come out
openly against the bourgeoisie; that from 1840 to 1847, at the time of the
bourgeois, truly constitutional movement, the Rhenish bourgeoisie stood in the
forefront and decisively tipped the balance in Berlin in March 1848. The
reason, however, why Rhenish Prussia could never achieve anything in an open
insurrection or even bring about a general insurrection of the whole province
is best explained by a straightforward account of the campaign for the Imperial
Constitution in the Rhineland.</p>
<p>The struggle had just broken out in Dresden; it might break out at any
moment in the Palatinate. In Baden, in Wurttemberg and in Franconia mass
rallies were launched and people barely concealed their determination to settle
the question by force of arms. In the whole of South Germany the troops were
wavering. Prussia was no less roused. The proletariat was only waiting for an
opportunity of revenging itself for having been tricked of the gains it
believed it had won for itself in March 1848. Everywhere the petty bourgeois
were busy welding together all the discontented elements into a great Imperial
Constitution party whose leadership they hoped to secure for themselves. Their
sworn promises to stand or fall with the Frankfurt Assembly and stake property
and life for the Imperial Constitution filled all the newspapers and rang out
in every club-room and every beer-house.</p>
<p>It was at this point that the Prussian Government opened hostilities by
calling up a large part of the army reserve,<sup class="enote"><a href="#144">[144]</a></sup> particularly in Westphalia and on the Rhine. To
order a call-up during a period of peace was illegal and not only the petty
bourgeoisie but also the bigger bourgeoisie rose up against it.</p>
<p>The Cologne municipal council proclaimed a congress of deputies of the
Rhenish municipal councils. The government banned it; conventions were
disregarded and the congress held in spite of the ban. The municipal councils,
representing the big and middle bourgeoisie, declared their recognition of the
Imperial Constitution, demanded its acceptance by the Prussian Government and
the dismissal of the ministry as well as the repeal of the order calling up the
army reserve, and threatened unambiguously enough that the Rhine Provinces
would secede from Prussia if these demands were not met.<sup class="enote"><a href="#145">[145]</a></sup></p>
<p class="quote">"Since the Prussian Government has dissolved the Second
Chamber following on the latter's pronouncement in favour of unconditional
acceptance of the German Constitution of March 28 of this year and has thereby
deprived the people of its representation and voice in the present critical
moment, the undersigned delegates of the towns and municipalities of the Rhine
Province have assembled to discuss the need of the fatherland.</p>
<p class="quote">"The meeting, chaired by Councillors Zell of Trier and Werner
of Coblenz and assisted by the clerks of the minutes, Councillors Boecker of
Cologne and Bloem II of Dusseldorf,</p>
<p class="quote"><i>has resolved as follows:</i></p>
<p class="quote">"1. This meeting declares that it recognises the Constitution
of the German Empire, as promulgated by the Reich Assembly on March 28 of this
year, as a definitive law and that in the conflict brought about by the
Prussian Government it stands on the side of the German Reich Assembly.</p>
<p class="quote">"2. The meeting calls upon the entire people of the Rhineland,
and in particular all men capable of bearing arms, to make collective
declarations in smaller or larger gatherings of its commitment and steadfast
intent to uphold the German Imperial Constitution and comply with the
ordinances of the Imperial Constitution.</p>
<p class="quote">"3. The meeting calls on the German Reich Assembly henceforth
and with the utmost dispatch to make greater efforts to give to the resistance
of the people in the separate German states and in particular in the Rhine
Province that unity and strength which alone is capable of thwarting the
well-organised counter-revolution.</p>
<p class="quote">"4. It calls on the imperial authorities to take steps as soon
as possible to tender to the imperial troops an oath of loyalty to the
Constitution and to decree a concentration of these troops.</p>
<p class="quote">"5. The undersigned pledge themselves to secure recognition of
the Imperial Constitution by all means at their disposal in the area of their
municipalities.</p>
<p class="quote">"6. The meeting considers the dismissal of the
Brandenburg-Manteuffel Ministry and the summoning of the Chambers, without
change in the existing system of voting, to be absolutely necessary.</p>
<p class="quote">"7. In particular it considers the recent partial call-up of
the army reserve to be an unnecessary measure which highly endangers the
internal peace, and experts its immediate repeal.</p>
<p class="quote">"8. Lastly the undersigned express their conviction that if
the content of this declaration is disregarded the fatherland is threatened by
the greatest dangers which could even jeopardise the continued existence of
Prussia as at present constituted. "Resolved on May 8, 1849, at Cologne." </p>

<p>We would only add that the same Herr Zell who presided over this meeting
went a few weeks later as imperial commissioner of the Frankfurt imperial
ministry<sup class="enote"><a href="#146">[146]</a></sup> to Baden, not only
for the purpose of appeasement, but also to plot with the local reactionaries
those counter-revolultionary coups which later broke out in Mannheim and
Karlsruhe. It is at least probable that at the same time he served imperial
General Peucker as a military spy. </p>
<p>We insist on firmly establishing this fact. The big bourgeoisie, the flower
of the pre-March liberalism of the Rhineland, sought from the very beginning to
place themselves at the head of the movement for the Imperial Constitution in
Rhenish Prussia. Their speeches, their resolutions, their whole demeanour
demonstrated their solidarity for the subsequent events. There were plenty of
people who took the words of the municipal councillors seriously, especially
the threat that the Rhine Province would secede. If the big bourgeoisie went
along with the movement, then the cause was as good as won from the beginning;
it would mean that every class of the population was taking part, and that one
could afford to take a risk. The petty bourgeois calculated along these lines
and hastened to strike a heroic pose, It goes without saying that his supposed
<i>associe</i> the big bourgeois, did not let this in any way deter him from
betraying the petty bourgeois at the first opportunity and afterwards, when the
whole affair had come to a truly miserable end, from ridiculing him for his
stupidity to boot.</p>
<p>In the meantime the excitement continually mounted; the news from all areas
of Germany sounded extremely warlike. At last steps were to be taken to fit out
the army reserve. The battalions met and declared categorically that they would
not let themselves be fitted out. The majors, in the absence of sufficient
military support, could do nothing and were happy if they escaped without
threats or actual attacks. They dismissed their men and set a new date for
fitting-out.</p>
<p>The government, which could easily have given the officers of the army
reserve the necessary backing, was purposely allowing things to go so far. It
now immediately used force.</p>
<p>The refractory army reserve units came in particular from the industrial
region of Berg and the Mark. Elberfeld and Iserlohn, Solingen and the Ennepe
valley were the centres of resistance. Troops were ordered at once to the first
two towns.<sup class="enote"><a href="#147">[147]</a></sup></p>
<p>A battalion of the 16th Regiment, a squadron of lancers and two pieces of
artillery moved to Elberfeld. The town was in a state of great confusion. The
army reserve had found on mature reflection that they were after all playing a
risky game. Many peasants and workers were politically apathetic and had merely
been unwilling to absent themselves from their homes for an indefinite period
to comply with some chance whim of the government. The consequences of
insubordination weighed heavily upon them: <i>species facti,</i> martial law,
confinement in irons and perhaps even the firing-squad! Suffice it to say, the
number of army reserve men up in arms (they had their weapons) dwindled and
dwindled, and in the end there were only about forty left. They had set up
their headquarters in an inn outside the town and were awaiting the Prussians
there. Around the town hall stood the civic militia and two citizens' rifle
corps, vacillating and negotiating with the army reserve but at all events
determined to protect their property. The people were thronging the streets:
petty bourgeois who had sworn loyalty to the Imperial Constitution in the
political club and proletarians of all levels, from the resolute, revolutionary
worker to the gin-swilling drayman. Nobody knew what to do or what would
happen.</p>
<p>The town council wanted to negotiate with the troops. The commander rejected
all overtures and marched into the town. The troops paraded through the streets
and drew up in front of the town hall, opposite the civic militia. There were
negotiations. Stones were thrown at the troops from the crowd. The army
reserve, about forty strong as earlier indicated, after lengthy discussions
also marched over from the other side of the town towards the troops.</p>
<p>Suddenly a cry was raised among the people for the freeing of the prisoners.
In the prison close to the town hall, sixty-nine Solingen workers had been in
custody for a year for demolishing the cast-steel works near the castle. They
were to be tried in a few days' time. Intent on freeing these men, the people
made a rush for the prison. The doors gave way, the people broke in and the
prisoners were free. At the same time, however, the troops advanced, a volley
rang out and the last prisoner, hurrying through the door, dropped to the
ground with a shattered skull.</p>
<p>The people fell back, but with the cry: "To the barricades!" In a trice the
approaches to the inner city were secured. Unarmed workers were there in
plenty, but there were at most only fifty men with arms behind the
barricades.</p>
<p>The artillery advanced. Like the infantry before it, it fired too high,
probably on purpose. Both bodies of troops were made up of Rhinelanders or
Westphalians, and were good. Eventually Captain von Uttenhoven advanced at the
head of the 8th Company of the 16th Regiment.</p>
<p>Three armed men were behind the first barricade. "Don't shoot at us," they
cried, "we only shoot at officers!" The captain ordered halt. "Just order ready
and there you'll lie," one of the riflemen behind the barricade shouted at him.
"Ready! Present! Fire!" A salvo rang out, but at the very same moment the
captain slumped to the ground. The bullet had hit him through the heart.</p>
<p>The platoon retreated in all haste, not even taking back the captain's body.
A few more shots rang out, a few soldiers were wounded and the commanding
officer, who did not relish staying overnight in the rebellious town, pulled
out again and bivouacked with his troops an hour's march outside the town. As
the soldiers withdrew, barricades were at once raised on all sides.</p>
<p>The same evening the news of the retreat of the Prussians reached
Dusseldorf. Numerous groups formed in the streets; the petty bourgeois and the
workers were in a state of extreme excitement. Then the rumour that fresh
troops were to be sent to Elberfeld gave the signal for action. Without giving
a thought to the lack of weapons (the civic militia had been disarmed since
November 1848), the relatively strong garrison and the disadvantage posed by
the broad, straight streets of the little ex-capital, some workers raised a
call to the barricades. In Neustrasse and Bolkerstrasse a few fortifications
were thrown up; the other parts of the town were kept free partly by the troops
who had already been consigned there beforehand and partly by the fear of the
big and petty bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>Towards evening the fighting began. Here, as elsewhere, there were only a
few fighters on the barricades. And where were they to get weapons and
ammunition! Suffice it to say that they fought back bravely for a long time
against superior odds and only after extensive use of artillery, towards
morning, were the half-dozen barricades that could be defended in the hands of
the Prussians. As we know, on the following day these cautious heroes took
their bloody revenge on servant girls, old folk and other peaceful people.</p>
<p>On the same day that the Prussians were beaten back from Elberfeld, another
battalion, from the 13th Regiment if I am not mistaken, was to enter Iserlohn
and bring the army reserve there to reason. But here too the plan was
frustrated; as soon as the news of the advance of the troops became known, the
army reserve and the people fortified all the approaches to the town and
awaited the enemy with rifles at the ready. The battalion did not dare to make
an attack and withdrew again.</p>
<p>The fighting in Elberfeld and Dusseldorf and the barricading of Iserlohn
gave the signal for the uprising of the greater part of the industrial region
of Berg and the Mark. The people of Solingen stormed the Grafrath arsenal and
armed themselves with the rifles and cartridges they took from it; the people
of Hagen joined the movement en masse, armed themselves, occupied the
approaches to the Ruhr and sent out reconnaissance patrols; Solingen, Ronsdorf,
Remscheid, Barmen, etc., sent their contingents to Elberfeld. In the other
localities of the region the army reserve declared itself for the movement and
placed itself at the disposal of the Frankfurt Assembly. Elberfeld, Solingen,
Hagen and Iserlohn replaced the district and the local authorities, who had
been driven out, with committees of public safety.</p>
<p>Needless to say the news of these events was monstrously exaggerated. The
whole of the Wupper and Ruhr area was pictured as one huge, organised camp of
insurrection. There were said to be 15,000 armed men in Elberfeld and as many
in Iserlohn and Hagen. The panic which suddenly seized the government and at
one blow paralysed all its measures to deal with this uprising in the most
loyal districts played no small part in making these exaggerations credible.</p>
<p>After making all reasonable allowances for probable exaggerations, the
undeniable fact remained that the main centres of the industrial region of Berg
and the Mark were engaged in an open and so far victorious uprising. That was a
fact. There was further the news that Dresden was still holding out, that
Silesia was in a state of ferment, that the movement in the Palatinate was
consolidating, that in Baden a victorious military revolt had broken out and
the Grand Duke <span class="context">[Leopold–Ed.]</span> had fled and
that the Magyars stood on the banks of the Jablunka and the Leitha. To sum up,
of all the revolutionary opportunities that had presented themselves to the
democratic and workers' party since March 1848 this was by far the most
favourable, and of course it had to be seized. The left bank of the Rhine could
not leave the right bank in the lurch.</p>
<p>What should be done now?</p>
<p>All the larger towns of the Rhine Province are either fortress towns like
Cologne and Coblenz, dominated by strong citadels and forts, or they have
numerous garrisons like Aachen, Dusseldorf and Trier. In addition to this the
province is further kept in check by the Wesel, Julich, Luxembourg, Saarlouis
and even the Mainz and Minden fortresses. In these fortresses and garrisons
there were altogether at least 30,000 men. Finally, Cologne, Dusseldorf, Aachen
and Trier had been disarmed for some time. So the revolutionary centres of the
province were paralysed. Here every attempt at an uprising, as had already been
demonstrated in Dusseldorf, would inevitably end in a victory for the military;
another such victory, e.g. in Cologne, would mean the moral crushing of the
uprising in Berg and the Mark, in spite of the otherwise favourable news. On
the left bank of the Rhine a movement was possible on the Moselle, in the Eifel
and the Krefeld industrial district; but this region was encircled by six
fortresses and three garrison towns. On the other hand, those districts on the
right bank of the Rhine which were already in insurrection offered a densely
populated, extensive terrain which with its woods an mountains seemed to be
made for an insurrectionary war.</p>
<p>If the intention was to support the insurgent districts, then there was only
one course open:</p>
<p>above all things avoid unnecessary disorders in the fortresses and garrison
towns;</p>
<p>make a diversion on the left bank of the Rhine in the smaller towns, in the
factory areas and in the countryside in order to hold the Rhine garrisons in
check;</p>
<p>finally, throw all available forces into the insurgent district on the right
bank of the Rhine, spread the insurrection further and attempt to organise here
the nucleus of a revolutionary army around the army reserve.</p>
<p>Prussia's new heroes, who specialise in revelations, should not rejoice too
soon over the treasonable conspiracy here revealed. Unfortunately no conspiracy
existed. The above three measures are no conspiratorial plan but a simple
suggestion put forward by the writer of these lines when he himself left for
Elberfeld to see to the execution of the third point.<sup class="enote"><a href="#148">[148]</a></sup> Thanks to the dilapidated organisation of the
democratic and workers' party, thanks to the indecision and shrewd cautiousness
of most of the local leaders who had come from the petty bourgeoisie, and
finally thanks to the lack of time, it never came to a conspiracy. Therefore if
the beginnings of a diversion did indeed materialise on the left bank of the
Rhine and if in Kempen, Neuss and the surrounding country disorders did break
out and the arsenal in Prum was stormed,<sup class="enote"><a href="#149">[149]</a></sup> these incidents were by no means the outcome of a
common plan but were merely a manifestation of the revolutionary instinct of
the people.</p>
<p>In the insurgent districts in the meantime things looked completely
different from what the rest of the province would lead one to suppose. It must
be admitted that Elberfeld with its barricades (which were, however, extremely
unplanned and thrown together in a hurry), with its many sentinels, patrols and
other armed men, with its whole population in the streets, only the big
bourgeoisie apparently missing, and with its red flags and tricolours<sup class="enote"><a href="#150">[150]</a></sup> did not look at all bad, but
otherwise the greatest confusion reigned in the town. Through the Committee of
Public Safety formed in the first moments, the petty bourgeoisie had taken the
direction of affairs into its hands. It had scarcely got thus far when it took
fright at its power, limited as it was. The first thing it did was to get
legitimation from the town council, i.e. from the big bourgeoisie, and out of
gratitude for the town council's kindness to take five of its members into the
Committee of Public Safety. Reinforced in this way, the Committee forthwith
washed its hands of all dangerous activity by transferring the responsibility
for external security to a military commission, over which, however, it
reserved for itself a moderating and restraining control. Secured in this
fashion from all contact with the uprising and transplanted by the fathers of
the town onto the ground of legality, the trembling petty bourgeois on the
Committee of Public Safety were able to confine themselves to calming tempers,
looking after day-to-day business, clearing up "misunderstandings", quietening
people down, procrastinating and paralysing every form of energetic activity
under the pretext that it was first necessary to await the answers given to the
deputations sent to Berlin and Frankfurt. The rest of the petty bourgeoisie
naturally went hand in hand with the Committee of Public Safety, quietened
things down everywhere, did all they could to hinder the continuation of
defence measures and distribution of arms and constantly wavered as to how far
they would go with the uprising. Only a small part of this class was determined
to defend itself weapons in hand in the event of an attack on the town. The
great majority sought to persuade themselves that their threats alone and
aversion to the almost inevitable bombardment of Elberfeld would move the
government to make concessions; nevertheless they covered themselves against
all eventualities.</p>
<p>The big bourgeoisie, in the first moments after the battle, was as if
thunderstruck. In its terror it saw fantastic visions of arson, murder, looting
and God knows what abominations rising up out of the ground. Therefore the
setting up of the Committee of Public Safety whose majority (town councillors,
lawyers, public prosecutors, sober people) suddenly offered it a guarantee for
life and property, filled it with more than fanatical delight. The selfsame big
merchants, dyers and manufacturers who up to now had decried Messrs. Karl
Hecker, Riotte, Hochster, etc.,as bloodthirsty terrorists, now hurried <i>en
masse</i> to the town hall, embraced the same alleged butchers with the most
feverish passion and deposited thousands of talers on the table of the
Committee of Public Safety. It goes without saying that when the movement was
ended these same enthusiastic admirers and supporters of the Committee of
Public Safety spread abroad the most extravagant and basest lies not only about
the movement itself but also about the Committee of Public Safety and its
members, and thanked the Prussians with a similar intensity of feeling for
liberation from a terror which had never existed. Innocent constitutional
bourgeois, like Messrs. Hecker, Hochster and Public Prosecutor Heintzmann, were
once more depicted as bugbears and man-eaters whose affinity to Robespierre and
Danton stood written all over their faces. For our part we consider it our duty
completely to exonerate these honourable gentlemen from any such accusation.
For the rest, the greater portion of the big bourgeoisie placed themselves,
their wives and their children with the utmost dispatch under the protection of
the Dusseldorf state of siege and only the smaller, more courageous portion
stayed behind to protect their property against any eventuality. The Chief
Burgomaster <span class="context">[Johann Adolph Carnap.–Ed.]</span>
stayed hidden in an overturned, manure-covered cab for the duration of the
uprising. The proletariat, united in the heat of the struggle, split as soon as
the Committee of Public Safety and the petty bourgeoisie began to waver. The
artisans, the actual factory workers and a section of the silk-weavers backed
the movement up to the hilt; but they, who formed the core of the proletariat,
were almost entirely without weapons. The dye-workers, a robust, well-paid
working class, coarse and consequently reactionary like all sections of workers
whose occupation demands more physical strength than skill, had lost all
interest even during the first days. They alone of all the industrial workers
stayed at work while the barricades were up and did not allow themselves to be
disturbed. Finally the lumpenproletariat was here as elsewhere corruptible from
the second day of the movement onwards, demanding weapons and pay from the
Committee of Public Safety in the morning and selling itself to the big
bourgeois in the afternoon to protect their buildings or rip down the
barricades when evening fell. On the whole it stood on the side of the
bourgeoisie, which paid it most and with whose money it led a gay life as long
as the movement lasted.</p>
<p>The negligence and cowardice of the Committee of Public Safety and the
discord in the military commission, in which the party of inaction initially
had the majority, prevented any decisive action from the very beginning. From
the second day onwards reaction set in. From the outset it became evident that
in Elberfeld the only chance of success was under the banner of the Imperial
Constitution and in agreement with the petty bourgeoisie. On the one hand, the
proletariat had, here in particular, only too recently freed itself from the
slough of gin and pietism for even the slightest notion of the conditions of
its liberation to penetrate the masses, and on the other hand it had a too
instinctive hatred for the bourgeoisie and was much too indifferent towards the
bourgeois question of the Imperial Constitution to work up any enthusiasm for
such tricolour interests. This put the resolute party, the only one to consider
the question of defence seriously, in a false position. It declared itself for
the Imperial Constitution. The petty bourgeoisie, however, did not trust it,
maligned it in every way to the people and impeded all the measures it took to
distribute arms and erect fortifications. Every order that could really serve
to put the town in a state of defence was immediately countermanded by the
first member of the Committee of Public Safety to come along. Every philistine
in front of whose house a barricade was set up at once hurried to the town hall
and procured a reversal of the order. The funds for the payment of the
barricade-workers (and they asked for the very minimum to avoid starvation)
could only be squeezed out of the Committee of Public Safety with great effort
and in paltry amounts. Wages and rations for those bearing arms were provided
irregularly and were often insufficient. For five to six days there was neither
roll-call nor muster of armed men, with the result that nobody knew how many
fighters could be reckoned on if an emergency arose. Not until the fifth day
was an attempt made to detail the armed men, but the attempt was never carried
into effect and was based on a total ignorance of the number of the fighting
forces. Every member of the Committee of Public Safety acted on his own. There
was a clash of the most contradictory orders and the only thing most of them
had in common was to add to the easy-going confusion and prevent any energetic
steps being taken. As a result of this the proletariat became heartily sick of
the whole movement and after a few days the big bourgeoisie and the petty
bourgeoisie succeeded in their aim of making the workers as apathetic as
possible.</p>
<p>When I reached Elberfeld on May 11, the armed men numbered at least 2,500 to
3,000. Of these, however, only the reinforcements from outside and the handful
of armed Elberfeld workers were reliable. The army reserve was vacillating;
most of them had a mighty dread of imprisonment in chains. At first there were
not many of them, but they were reinforced by the admission of all the
shilly-shallying and faint-hearted elements from the other detachments. Finally
the civic militia, reactionary here from the very first and set up specifically
to suppress the workers, declared itself neutral and wanted nothing but merely
to protect its property. All this only came to light in the course of the next
few days; in the meantime, however, a section of the reinforcements from
outside and the workers dispersed and the number of actual fighting forces
dwindled as a result of the stagnation of the movement, while the civic militia
held together more and more and with every day more openly expressed its
reactionary desires. During the last few nights it was already tearing down a
number of the barricades. The armed reinforcements, who certainly numbered at
first more than a thousand men, were already reduced to half on the 12th or
13th, and when at length there was a general roll-call it became evident that
the entire armed force upon which one could reckon by now numbered at the most
700 to 800 men. The army reserve and the civic militia refused to appear at
this roll-call.</p>
<p>That is not all. Insurgent Elberfeld was surrounded by places all of which
were alleged to be "neutral". Barmen, Kronenberg, Lennep, Luttringhausen, etc.,
had not joined the movement. The revolutionary workers of these places, insofar
as they had weapons, had marched to Elberfeld. The civic militia, which in all
these places was purely an instrument in the hands of the manufacturers for
holding down the workers, and was composed of the manufacturers, their factory
overseers and the shopkeepers wholly dependent on the manufacturers, ruled here
in the interests of "order" and the manufacturers. The workers themselves, who
because of their dispersion in the more rural areas were rather out of touch
with the political movement, had been partially brought over to the side of the
manufacturers by the familiar means of coercion and by slanders about the
character of the Elberfeld movement; among the peasants these slanders always
worked unfailingly. In addition, the movement had come at a time when the
manufacturers, after a business crisis of fifteen months, at last had full
order books again; and it is common knowledge that no revolution can be made
with regularly employed workers – a circumstance which also had a very
significant effect in Elberfeld. It is obvious that under all these conditions
the "neutral" neighbours were only so many covert enemies.</p>
<p>And there was still more to it than that. No links were established with the
other insurgent districts. From time to time odd individuals came over from
Hagen; as good as nothing was known of Iserlohn. Some individuals offered their
services as commissaries, but none of them was to be trusted. Several couriers
between Elberfeld and Hagen were said to have been arrested by the civic
militia in Barmen and the surrounding area. The only place with which there was
regular communication was Solingen, and the situation there looked no different
from that in Elberfeld. That it looked no worse there was due only to the good
organisation and determination of the Solingen workers, who had sent 400 to 500
armed men to Elberfeld and yet were still strong enough to keep their own
bourgeoisie and civic militia in check. If the Elberfeld workers had been as
developed and as organised as the Solingen workers, the chances would have been
completely different.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances there was only one possibility left: to take
swift, energetic measures to inject new life into the movement, provide it with
new fighting forces, cripple its internal enemies and organise it as strongly
as possible throughout the whole industrial area of Berg and the Mark. The
first step was to disarm the Elberfeld civic militia, distribute its weapons
among the workers and impose a compulsory tax for the maintenance of the
workers thus armed. This step would have broken decisively with all the
slackness which had hitherto characterised the Committee of Public Safety,
given the proletariat new life and crippled the "neutral" districts' capacity
for resistance. How then to go about getting weapons from these districts too,
spreading the insurrection and regularly organising the defence of the whole
region depended on the success of this first step With an order from the
Committee of Public Safety and with no more than the 400 Solingen workers the
Elberfeld civic militia would have been disarmed in no time. Courage was not
their strong point.</p>
<p>For the safety of those Elberfelders charged in May and still in prison, I
owe the declaration that I alone was responsible for all these proposals. I
began to call for the disarming of the civic militia immediately when the
Committee of Public Safety's funds began to run out.</p>
<p>But the commendable Committee of Public Safety did not at all consider that
it was necessary to take such "terroristic measures" The only thing I managed
to get carried out, or rather, directed on my own initiative together with a
few corps leaders – who all got away safely and some of whom are already
in America, was to fetch some eighty rifles belonging to the Kronenberg civic
militia which were kept in the town hall there. And these rifles, distributed
with extreme carelessness, ended up for the most part in the hands of gin-happy
lumpenproletarians, who sold them that very evening to the bourgeoisie. These
same bourgeois gentlemen were sending agents among the people to buy up as many
rifles as possible and they paid quite a high price for them. In this way the
Elberfeld lumpenproletarians delivered up to the bourgeoisie several hundred
rifles, which had got into their hands through the negligence and lack of order
of the improvised authorities. With these rifles the factory overseers, the
most reliable dye-workers, etc., etc., were armed and the ranks of the
"well-disposed" civic militia strengthened from day to day.</p>
<p>The gentlemen of the Committee of Public Safety answered every proposal for
improving the town's defences by saying that there was no point, the Prussians
would take care not to come there, they would never venture into the mountains,
and so on. They themselves were fully aware that in saying this they were
spreading the most barefaced lies, that the town could be bombarded from all
the heights even with field-guns, that no arrangements at all had been made for
any at all serious defence and that, the insurrection having come to a halt and
the Prussians possessing a colossal superiority, only really extraordinary
events could now save the Elberfeld uprising.</p>
<p>The Prussian generals, however, did not seem to be particularly anxious to
venture into a terrain which was as good as totally unknown to them, at least
not until they had assembled a truly overwhelming force. The four unfortified
towns of Elberfeld, Hagen, Iserlohn and Solingen made such an impression on
these cautious military heroes that they had an entire army of twenty thousand
men and large numbers of cavalry and artillery brought up, partly by rail, from
Wesel, Westphalia and the eastern provinces. Not daring to attack, they had a
regular strategic formation drawn up the other side of the Ruhr. High command
and general staff, right flank, centre. everything was in the most beautiful
order, just as if they were facing a colossal enemy army, as if it were a
question of giving battle to a Bem or a Dembiriski and not of an unequal fight
against a few hundred unorganised workers, badly armed, virtually leaderless
and betrayed behind their backs by those who had put the weapons into their
hands.</p>
<p>We know how the insurrection ended.<sup class="enote"><a href="#151">[151]</a></sup> We know how the workers, disgusted with the petty
bourgeoisie's constant procrastination, its faint-hearted shilly-shallying and
its treacherous lulling into a false sense of security, finally moved out of
Elberfeld to fight their way through to the first state they came to where the
Imperial Constitution offered them the slightest refuge. We know how they were
hunted by Prussian lancers and by incited peasants. We know how immediately
after their departure the big bourgeoisie crawled out into the open again, had
the barricades carried off and built triumphal arches for the approaching
Prussian heroes. We know how Haben and Solingen were played into the hands of
the Prussians through direct betrayal by the bourgeoisie and how only Iserlohn
put up a fight, unequal and lasting two hours, against the 24th Regiment, the
conquerors of Dresden, who were already laden with booty.</p>
<p>Some of the Elberfeld, Solingen and Mulheim workers got safely through to
the Palatinate. Here they met with their fellow-countrymen, the fugitives from
the storming of the Prum arsenal. Together with these they formed a company
consisting almost exclusively of Rhinelanders in Willich's volunteer corps. All
their comrades will surely testify that whenever they came under fire, and
especially in the last decisive battle on the Murg, they fought very
bravely.</p>
<p>The Elberfeld insurrection deserved this more detailed description because
it was here that the position of the different classes in the Imperial
Constitution movement was most sharply pronounced and furthest developed. In
the other towns in Berg and the Mark the movement resembled that in Elberfeld
in every way, except that there the participation or non-participation in the
movement by the various classes was less clearly defined, the classes
themselves not being so sharply differentiated as in the industrial centre of
the area. In the Palatinate and in Baden, where concentrated large-scale
industry and along with it a developed big bourgeoisie are almost non-existent,
where the class relationships merge into each other in a much more easy-going
and patriarchal way, the mixture of the classes that were the mainstay of the
movement was even more confused. We shall see this later, but we shall also see
at the same time how all these admixtures to the uprising likewise end up by
grouping themselves around the petty bourgeoisie as the core for the
crystallisation of the whole splendour of the Imperial Constitution.</p>
<p>It is abundantly clear from the attempted uprisings in Rhenish Prussia in
May of last year what position this part of Germany is capable of occupying in
a revolutionary movement. Surrounded by seven fortresses, three of them
first-class for Germany, constantly manned by almost a third of the entire
Prussian army, intersected in all directions by railways and with an entire
fleet of transport steamers at the disposal of the military authorities, a
Rhineland uprising has no prospect of succeeding except under quite exceptional
circumstances. Only when the citadels are in the hands of the people can the
Rhinelanders hope to achieve anything by force of arms. And such an eventuality
can only arise either if the military authorities are terrorised by tremendous
external events and lose their heads, or if the military declare themselves
wholly or partly for the movement. In every other case an uprising in the Rhine
Province is doomed in advance. A swift march on Frankfurt by the Badeners and
on Trier by the Palatines would probably have led to the uprising immediately
breaking out on the Moselle and in the Eifel, in Nassau and in both parts of
Hesse, and the troops of the central Rhenish states, who at that time were
still favourably disposed, joining the movement. There is no doubt that all the
Rhenish troops, and especially the entire 7th and 8th artillery brigades, would
have followed their example, that they would at least have given loud enough
vent to their feelings to cause the Prussian generals to lose their heads.
Probably several fortresses would have fallen into the hands of the people, and
even if not Elberfeld, at least most of the left bank of the Rhine would have
been saved. All that, and perhaps much more, was forfeited as a result of the
shabby, cowardly and philistine policies of the wiseacres on the Baden
Provincial Committee.</p>
<p>With the defeat of the Rhenish workers died the only newspaper in which they
saw their interests openly and resolutely championed: the <i>Neue Rheinische
Zeitung.</i> The editor-in-chief,<span class="context">[Karl
Marx–ed.]</span> though a native of Rhenish Prussia, was expelled from
Prussia and the other editors had either direct arrest or immediate expulsion
hanging over their heads. The Cologne police explained this with extreme
naivete and went to great lengths to prove that they had enough against each
one of them to take proceedings along one or the other of these lines. In this
way the newspaper was forced to cease publication at the very moment when the
unprecedentedly rapid increase in its circulation more than secured its
existence. The editors scattered across the various German provinces where
uprisings had taken place or were still to take place; several went to Paris,
where yet again a critical moment was impending.<sup class="enote"><a href="#152">[152]</a></sup> There is not one of them who during or as a result
of the movements of this summer was not arrested or expelled, so experiencing
the fate which the Cologne police were kind enough to prepare for him. A number
of the compositors went to the Palatinate and joined the army.</p>
<p>The Rhenish uprising too had to end tragically. After three-quarters of the
Rhine Province had been placed in a state of siege, after hundreds had been
thrown into prison, it closed with the shooting on the eve of Frederick William
IV of Hohenzollern's birthday of three of the men who had stormed the Prum
arsenal." Vae victis!<span class="context">[Woe to the

<p class="fst"><span class="term">139</span><a id="139"></a> From May 3 to 9,
1849, Dresden, the capital of Saxony, was the scene of an armed uprising caused
by the refusal of the Saxon King to recognise the Imperial Constitution. The
insurgents captured a considerable part of the city, with the workers playing
the most active part in the barricade fighting, and formed a Provisional
Government headed by the radical demcocrat Samuel Tzschirner. The moderate line
pursued by the other members of the Provisional Government, the desertion of
the bourgeois civic militia and the treacherous actions of the bourgeoisie in
Leipzig where they suppressed the workers' solidarity movement, weakened the
insurgents' resistance to the counter-revolutionary forces. The uprising was
crushed by Saxon and Prussian troops. The Russian revolutionary Mikhail
Bakunin, the German working-class leader Stephan Born and the composer Richard
Wagner took an active part in the uprising.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">140</span><a id="140"></a> On May 6 and 7,
1849, workers and other democratic elements in Breslau (Wroclaw) erected
barricades in protest to the dispatch of artillery to suppress the Dresden
uprising, but they were defeated by vastly superior counterrevolutionary
forces. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">141</span><a id="141"></a> The <i>Holy
Roman Empire of the German Nation</i> (962-1806) included, at different times,
German, Italian, Austrian, Hungarian and Bohemian lands, Switzerland and the

structures, legal standards and customs.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">142</span><a id="142"></a> The Napoleonic
Code (Code Napoleon) – Napoleon's 1804 civil code which he introduced
into the conquered regions of Western and South Western Germany. It remained in

<p class="fst"><span class="term">143</span><a id="143"></a> <i>Prussian Law
(Allgemeines Landrecht fur die Preussischen Staaten)</i> was promulgated in
1794. It included criminal, state, civil, administrative and ecclesiastical law
and bore the distinct imprint of obsolete feudal legal standards.</p>
<p>After the annexation of the Rhine Province to Prussia in 1815, the Prussian
Government tried to introduce Prussian Law into various legal spheres there to
replace the French bourgeois codes in force in the province. This was done by
introducing a series of laws, edicts and instructions aimed at restoring the
feudal privileges of the nobility (primogeniture), Prussian criminal and
marriage law, etc. These measures were resolutely opposed in the province and
were repealed after the March revolution by special decrees issued on April 15,
1848. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">144</span><a id="144"></a> The army reserve
(Landwehr) was formed in Prussia at the time of the struggle against Napoleonic
rule. In the 1840s it was made up of persons up to 40 years of age who had
served three years in the army and been on the reserve list for at least two
years. As distinct from the regular troops, the army reserve was mobilised only
in special emergencies (war or threat of war). </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">145</span><a id="145"></a> On May 1, 1849,
the Cologne Municipal Council, composed mainly of representatives of the
liberal bourgeoisie, issued an appeal for the convocation, on May 5, 1849, of a
meeting of all the municipal councils of the Rhine Province to discuss the new
situation in Prussia resulting from the dissolution by the Prussian Government
on April 27 of the Second Chamber of the Prussian Provincial Diet, which had
approved the Imperial Constitution despite the King's intention to reject it.
The Prussian Government banned the meeting. Even so, the Cologne Municipal
Council convoked a congress in Cologne of delegates from the Rhine cities on
May 8, 1849. The congress came out in support of the Imperial Constitution and
demanded that the dissolved Diet be convoked. It was made clear that, if the
Prussian Government ignored the resolution of the congress (Engels quotes it
below), the Rhine Province would consider secession from Prussia. This threat,
however, proved empty as it was not backed up by resolute action on the part of
the liberal majority of the congress, which rejected a proposal for arming the
people and offering resistance to the authorities. </p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term">146</span> The Holy Roman Empire of the
German Nation (962-1806) included, at different times, German, Italian,

<a id="147"></a>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">147</span> The description of revolutionary
events given below deals mainly with Elberfeld, which was one of the main
centres of the uprising in Rhenish Prussia in defence of the Imperial
Constitution.</p>
<p>The Elbefeld uprising involved mainly workers and petty-bourgeois strata. It
flared up on May 9, 1849, and served as a signal for armed struggle in a number
of towns in the Rhine Province (Dusseldorf, Iserlohn, Solingen and others). The
immediate cause of the uprising was the Prussian Government's attempt to
suppress the revolutionary uprising on the Rhine with arms. crush democratic
organisations and the press and disarm those army reserve units which had
refused to take orders and backed the demand for the Imperial Constitution (the
army reserve had been mobilised by the Prussian Government itself). After the
expulsion of the Prussian troops who tried to capture the city, power in
Elberfeld passed into the hands of the Committee of Public Safety, composed
mainly of moderate democrats and liberals. In contrast to Elberfeld, the
uprising that broke out in Dusseldorf on May 9 was suppressed by troops on the
following day. In Elberfeld and other towns the insurgents were able to hold
out longer. </p>
<a id="148"></a>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">148</span> Engels arrived in Elberfeld on May
11, 1849, from insurgent Solingen, where, the day before, he had formed a
detachment of workers to help the Elberfeld insurgents. In Elberfeld he worked
for a reform of the bourgeois civic militia, the imposition of a war tax on the
bourgeoisie and the extensive arming of workers with a view to creating the
nucleus of a Rhenish revolutionary army and uniting localised uprisings. These
efforts were counteracted by the Committee of Public Safety, in which
considerable influence was wielded by representatives of the bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>Under pressure from bourgeois circles, Engels was deported from the city on
the morning of May 15. On May 17, the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> carried
an article, entitled "Elberfeld", describing the situation in the insurgent
city and Engels' activities there. Later an action was brought against Engels
for his part in the Elberfeld uprising. Engels also touches on his stay in
Elberfeld during the uprising in this series of articles. </p>
<a id="149"></a>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">149</span> The arsenal in Priim was stormed
by democrats and workers from Trier and neighbouring townships on May 17 and
18, 1849. Their aim was to seize the arms and extend the uprising in defence of
the Imperial Constitution to the areas on the left bank of the Rhine. The
insurgents succeeded in capturing the arsenal, but government troops soon
arrived on the scene and the movement was suppressed. </p>
<a id="150"></a>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">150</span> The <i>tricolour</i>–the
black-red-and-gold flag, symbolising Germany's national unity, was the banner
of the movement in support of the Imperial Constitution. </p>
<a id="151"></a>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">151</span> As a result of behind-the-scenes
negotiations between a delegation of the Elberfeld bourgeoisie and the
government, and the defeatist attitude of the Committee of Public Safety, the
Committee was dissolved by the city authorities on May 16, 1849. On the night
of May 17, the workers' detachments, including reinforcements from other towns,
were led out of Elberfeld under false pretences and the previous order was
restored in the city. The failure of the Elberfeld uprising brought the triumph
of reaction throughout Rhenish Prussia. </p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">152</span><a id="152"></a> Immediately
after the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> ceased publication, Marx and Engels
went to Frankfurt am Main and then to insurgent Baden and the Palatinate. Their
attempts to convince the Left deputies to the Frankfurt Assembly and members of
the Baden and Palatinate provisional governments of the need to extend the
movement throughout Germany, to mount a resolute offensive, and to persuade the
Assembly openly to join in the uprising proved, however, unavailing. In late
May 1849, Marx and Engels arrived in Bingen (Hesse) where they parted. Marx
went on to France to establish contacts with French democrats and socialists,
while Engels returned to the Palatinate to take a direct part in the impending
armed struggle against the concentrating counterrevolutionary troops. Besides
Marx, two other editors of the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung,</i> Ferdinand
Wolff and Ernst Dronke, went to Paris, where the Montagne party and the
revolutionary clubs were preparing for mass actions against the ruling party of
Order.</p>

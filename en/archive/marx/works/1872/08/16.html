<p>Sir, — In your issue of to-day I find a paragraph headed “The International,” containing, after “the Paris papers,” a pretended circular of the “Grand Council” of that Association, and bearing my signature as “General Secretary.”</p>
<p>I beg to state, in reply, that this document is from beginning to end a forgery. No such circular was ever issued by the General Council of the International Working Men’s Association, nor could 1 have signed anything of the sort as General Secretary, inasmuch as I have never occupied that position.</p>
<p>I request you to publish the above in your next number, and remain, Sir, your obedient servant,</p>
<p class="sig">Karl Marx</p>
<p>1, Maitland-park-road, N. W., Aug. 15.</p>

<p>Sir, — In <i>The National Reformer </i>of January 7th, Mr. Charles Bradlaugh says:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“We only meant to allege that Dr. Marx had, in former times, given information to his own Government.” </p>
<p>I simply declare that this is a calumny, as ridiculous as it is infamous. I call upon Mr. Bradlaugh to publish any fact that could afford him even the slightest pretext for his statement. For his personal tranquility I add that he shall not he “challenged.”</p>
<p>I am, Sir, yours obediently,</p>
<p class="sig">Karl Marx</p>

<p class="information">
During the 1870s, a major polemical debate unfolded
in Germany’s worker/democratic press on the shortage of housing available
to workers in major industrial centres. The influx and increase of the
proletariat created a housing crisis.</p>
<p class="information">
On June 26 1872, Engels contributed the first of a series of articles
to the <i>Volksstaat</i>, entitled “The Housing Question.” The last appeared
on February 22 1873. Engels’ central point was that the revolutionary class
policy of the proletariat cannot be replaced by a policy of reforms, because
"it is not that the solution of the housing question simultaneously solves
the social question, but that only by the solution of the social question,
that is, by the abolition of the capitalist mode of production, is the
solution of the housing question made possible."</p>

<p class="information">
The series criticizes Proudhonism (and petty-bourgeois socialism
in general, including Lassalleanism). It also discusses things like the
nature of the State, the dictatorship of the proletariat, the eradication
of the antithesis between town and country, the solution of the agrarian
problem, forms of the socialist reconstruction of society and the tasks
of the proletarian party.</p>

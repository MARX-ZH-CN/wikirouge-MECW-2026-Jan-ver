<p class="title">The Housing Question by Frederick Engels</p>
<h1>Part Three<br>
Supplement on Proudhon and the Housing Question</h1>
<p class="fst">In No. 86 of the <i>Volksstaat</i>, A. Mülberger
reveals himself as the author of the articles criticized by me in No. 51
and subsequent numbers of the paper. In his answer he overwhelms me with
such a series of reproaches, and at the same time distorts to such an extent
all the points of view which are at issue, that, willy-nilly, I am compelled
to reply to him. I shall attempt to give my reply, which to my regret must
be made to a large extent on the field of personal polemics enjoined upon
me by Mülberger himself, a general interest by presenting once again the
chief points and if possible more clearly than before, even at the risk
of being told once again by Mülberger that all this contains “nothing essentially
new either for him or for the other readers of the <i>Volksstaat</i>.” </p>
<p>Mülberger complains of the form and the content of my criticism.
As far as the form is concerned, it will be sufficient to reply that at
the time I did not even know who had written the articles in question.
There can therefore be no question of any personal “prejudice” against
their author; against the solution of the housing question put forward
in the articles I was certainly in so far “prejudiced” that I was long
ago acquainted with it from Proudhon and my opinion on it was firmly fixed.</p>
<p>I am not going to quarrel with friend Mülberger about the “tone” 
of my criticism. When one has been so long in the movement as I have, one
develops a fairly thick skin against attacks, and therefore one easily
presumes also the existence of the same in others. In order to compensate
Mülberger I shall try this time to bring my “tone” into the right relation
to the sensitiveness of his epidermis.</p>
<p>Mülberger complains with particular bitterness that I called him
a Proudhonist, and he protests that he is not one. Naturally, I must believe
him, but I shall adduce the proof that the articles in question – and
I had to do with them alone – contain nothing but undiluted Proudhonism.</p>
<p>But according to Mülberger I have also criticized Proudhon “frivolously” 
and have done him a serious injustice. “The doctrine of the petty-bourgeois
Proudhon has become an accepted dogma in Germany, which is even proclaimed
by many who have never read a line of him.” When I express regret that
for twenty years the workers of the Latin countries have had no other mental
nourishment than the works of Proudhon, Mülberger answers that as far as
the workers of the Latin countries are concerned, “the principles formulated
by Proudhon are almost everywhere the driving spirit of the movement.” 
This I am compelled to deny. First of all, the “driving spirit” of the
working class movement nowhere lies in “principles,” but everywhere in
the development of large-scale industry and its effects, the accumulation
and concentration of capital on the one hand and of the proletariat on
the other. Secondly, it is not correct that in the Latin countries Proudhon’s
so-called “principles” play the decisive role ascribed to them by Mülberger;
that “the principles of anarchism, of the organization of the forces economiques,
of the liquidation sociale, etc., have become the true bearers of the revolutionary
movement.” Not to speak of Spain and Italy, where the Proudhonist universal
panacea has only gained some influence in the still more botched form presented
by Bakunin, it is a notorious fact for anyone who knows the international
working class movement that in France the Proudhonists are nothing more
than an insignificant sect, while the masses of the French workers refuse
to have anything to do with the social reform plan drawn up by Proudhon
under the title Liquidation sociale and Organization des forces economiques.
This was shown, among other things, in the Commune. Although the Proudhonists
were strongly represented in the Commune, not the slightest attempt was
made to liquidate the old society or to organize the economic forces according
to Proudhon’s proposals. On the contrary, it is to the great honor of the
Commune that in all its economic measures the “driving spirit” was not
any set of “principles,” but simple, practical needs. And therefore the
measures taken by the Commune – abolition of night work in the bakeries,
prohibition of monetary fines in the factories, confiscation of idle factories
and workshops and their handing over to workers’ associations – were not
at all in accordance with the spirit of Proudhonism, but certainly in accordance
with the spirit of German scientific socialism. The only social measure
which the Proudhonists put through was the decision not to seize the Bank
of France, and this was partly responsible for the downfall of the Commune.
In the same way, when the so-called Blanquists made an attempt to transform
themselves from mere political revolutionaries into a socialist workers’
fraction with a definite programme – as was done by the Blanquist fugitives
in London in their manifesto, Internationale et Revolution – they did
not proclaim the “principles” of the Proudhonist plan of social salvation,
but rather adopted, and almost literally at that, the views of German scientific
socialism on the necessity of the political action of the proletariat and
of the dictatorship of the proletariat as the transitional stage to the
abolition of classes and with them of the state, views such as had already
been expressed in The Communist Manifesto and since then on innumerable
occasions. And if Mülberger even concludes, from the disapproval of Proudhon
by the Germans, a lack of understanding of the movement in the Latin countries
 “down to the Paris Commune,” then let him as a proof of this lack tell
us what work from the Latin side has even approximately so correctly understood
and described the Commune as the Address of the General Council of the
International on the Civil War in France, written by the German, Marx.</p>
<p>The only country where the working class movement is directly
under the influence of Proudhonist “principles” is Belgium, and precisely
as a result of this the Belgian movement comes, as Hegel would say, “from
nothing, through nothing, to nothing.” </p>
<p>When I consider it a misfortune that for twenty years the workers
of the Latin countries were fed directly or indirectly on Proudhon, I do
not mean that thoroughly mythical dominance of Proudhon’s reform recipe
– termed by Mülberger the “principles” – but the fact that their economic
criticism of existing society was infected by the absolutely false Proudhonist
phrases and that their political actions were bungled by Proudhonist influence.
Whether thus the “Proudhonized workers of the Latin countries” “stand more
in the revolution” than the German workers, who, in any case, understand
the meaning of German scientific socialism infinitely better than the workers
of the Latin countries understand their Proudhon, we shall be able to answer
when we have discovered what to “stand in the revolution” really means.
We have heard talk of people who “stand in the Grace of God, in the true
faith, in Christianity,” etc. But “standing” in the revolution, in the
most violent of all movements? Is then “the revolution” a dogmatic religion
in which one must have faith?</p>
<p>Mülberger further accuses me of having asserted, in defiance of
the express wording of his articles, that he had declared the housing question
to be an exclusively working class question.</p>
<p>This time Mülberger is really right. I overlooked the passage
in question. It was irresponsible of me to overlook it, for it is one of
the most characteristic of the whole tendency of his articles. Mülberger
writes actually in plain words:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “As we have been so frequently and largely exposed to the absurd
 accusation of pursuing a class policy, of striving for class
 domination, and such like, we wish to stress first of all and
 expressly that the housing question is by no means a question
 which affects the proletariat exclusively, but that, on the
 contrary, it interests to a quite outstanding extent the actual
 middle classes, the small tradesmen, the petty bourgeoisie, the
 whole bureaucracy.... The housing question is precisely that point
 of social reform which more than any other appears calculated to
 reveal the absolute inner identity of the interests of the
 proletariat on the one hand, and the interests of the actual
 middle classes of society on the other. The middle classes suffer
 just as much as, and perhaps even more than, the proletariat under
 the oppressive fetters of the rented dwelling. Today the actual
 middle classes of society are faced with the question of
 whether... they can summon up sufficient strength... to
 participate in the process of the transformation of society in
 alliance with the youthful, vigorous and energetic workers party,
 a transformation whose blessings will be enjoyed above all by the
 middle classes.” </p>
<p class="fst">
Friend Mülberger, therefore, lays down the following points here:</p>
<ol class="numbered">
<li>
 “We” are not pursuing any “class policy” and are not striving for “class
domination.” But the German Social-Democratic Party, just because it is
a working-class party, does inevitably pursue a “class policy,” the policy
of the working class. Since each political party sets out to win dominance
in the state, so the German Social-Democratic Party is necessarily striving
for its domination, that of the working class, hence a “class domination.” 
Moreover, every real proletarian party, from the English Chartists onward,
has put forward a class policy, the organization of the proletariat as
an independent political party, as the primary condition of its struggle,
and the dictatorship of the proletariat as the immediate aim of the struggle.
By declaring this to be “absurd,” Mülberger puts himself outside the
proletarian movement and into the camp of petty-bourgeois socialism.</li>
<li>
The housing question has the advantage that it is not an exclusively working
class question, but a question which “interests to a quite outstanding
extent” the petty bourgeoisie, in that, “the actual middle classes” suffer
from it “just as much as, and perhaps even more than, the proletariat.” 
If anyone declares that the petty bourgeoisie suffers, even if in one connection
only, “perhaps even more than the proletariat,” then he can hardly complain
when one counts him among the petty-bourgeois socialists. Has Mülberger
therefore any grounds for complaint when I say:</li>
</ol>
<p class="quoteb"> “It is with just such sufferings as these, which the working class
 endures in common with other classes, and particularly the petty
 bourgeoisie, that petty-bourgeois socialism, to which Proudhon
 belongs, prefers to occupy itself. And thus it is not at all
 accidental that our German Proudhonist occupies himself chiefly
 with the housing question, which, as we have seen, is by no means
 exclusively a working class question.” </p>
<ol class="numbered" start="3">
<li>
There is an “absolute inner identity” between the interests of “the actual
middle classes of society” and the interests of the proletariat, and it
is not the proletariat, but these actual middle classes who will “enjoy
above all” the “blessings” of the coming transformation of society.</li>
</ol>
<p class="fst">
The workers, therefore, are going to make the coming social revolution
 “above all” in the interests of the petty bourgeoisie. And further, there
is an absolute inner identity of the interests of the petty bourgeoisie
and those of the proletariat. If the interests of the petty bourgeoisie
have an inner identity with those of the workers, then the interests of
the workers have an inner identity with those of the petty bourgeoisie.
The petty-bourgeois standpoint has thus as much right to exist in the movement
as the proletarian standpoint has, and it is precisely the assertion of
this equality of right that is called petty-bourgeois socialism.</p>
<p>It is, therefore also perfectly logical when, on page 25 of the
reprint, Mülberger extols “small enterprise” as the “actual buttress of
society,” because “in accordance with its own nature, it unites the three
factors: labor – acquisition – property, and because in the unification
of these three factors it places no bounds to the capacity for development
of the individual,” and when he reproaches modern industry in particular
with destroying this nursery for the production of normal human beings
and “making out of a vigorous class continually reproducing itself, a helpless
mass of human beings who do not know whither to direct their anxious glances.” 
The petty bourgeois is thus Mülberger’s model human being and small-scale
enterprise is Mülberger’s model mode of production. Did I defame him therefore
when I put him among the petty-bourgeois socialists?</p>
<p>As Mülberger rejects all responsibility for Proudhon, it would
be superfluous to discuss here any further how Proudhon’s reform plans
aim at transforming all members of society into petty bourgeois and small
peasants. It will be just as unnecessary to deal here with the alleged
identity of the interests of the petty bourgeoisie and the workers. What
is necessary is to be found already in The Communist Manifesto. (Leipzig
Edition, 1872, pp. 12, 21.)</p>
<p>The result of our examination is therefore that side by side with
the “myth of the petty bourgeois Proudhon” appears the reality of the petty
bourgeois Mülberger.</p>
<h3><a id="s2">II</a></h3>
<p class="fst">We now come to one of the main points. I accused Mülberger’s articles
of falsifying economic relationships after the manner of Proudhon by translating
them into legal terminology. As an example of this, I picked out the following
passage of Mülberger:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “The house, once it has been built, serves as a perpetual legal
 title to a definite fraction of social labor although the real
 value of the house has already long ago been more than paid out in
 the form of rent to the owner. Thus it comes about that a house
 that, for instance, was built fifty years ago, during this period
 covers the original cost two, three, five, ten or more times over
 in its rent yield.” </p>
<p class="fst">
Mülberger now complains as follows:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “This simple, sober statement of fact causes Engels to enlighten
 me to the effect that I should have explained how the house became
 a ‘legal title’ – something which was quite outside the scope of
 my task.... A description is one thing, an explanation another.
 When I say with Proudhon that the economic life of society should
 be pervaded by a conception of justice, then I am describing
 present-day society as one in which, it is true, not all
 conceptions of justice are absent, but in which the conception of
 justice of the revolution is absent, a fact which even Engels will
 admit.” </p>
<p class="fst">
Let us keep for the moment to the house which has been built. The house,
once it has been let, brings in for its builder ground rent, repairing
costs, and interest on the building capital invested, as well as the profit
made thereon in the form of rent, and, according to the circumstances,
the rent installments can gradually amount to twice, thrice, five times,
or ten times as much as the original cost price of the house. This, friend
Mülberger, is the “simple, sober statement of fact,” an economic fact,
and if we want to know “how it happens” that it exists, then we must conduct
our examination on the economic field. Let us, therefore, look a little
closer at the fact so that not even a child may misunderstand it any longer.
As is known, the sale of a commodity consists in the fact that its owner
relinquishes its use value and puts its exchange value into his pocket.
The use values of commodities differ from one another among other things
in the varying periods of time required for their consumption. A loaf of
bread is consumed in a day, a pair of trousers will be worn out in a year,
and a house, if you like, in a hundred years. Hence, in the case of commodities
with a long period of wear, the possibility arises of selling their use
value piecemeal and each time for a definite period, that is to say, to
let it out. The piecemeal sale therefore realizes the exchange value only
gradually. As a compensation for his renouncing the immediate repayment
of the capital advanced and the profit earned on it, the seller receives
an increased price, interest, whose rate is determined by the laws of political
economy and not by any means in an arbitrary fashion. At the end of the
hundred years the house is used up, worn out and no longer habitable. If
we then deduct from the total rent paid for the house the following: 1.
The ground rent together with any increase that may have occurred to it
during the period in question, and 2. the sums expended for current repairs,
we shall find that the remainder is composed on an average as follows:
1. the building capital originally invested in the house; 2. the profit
on this, and 3. the interest on the gradually maturing capital and on the
profit. Now it is true that at the end of this period the tenant has no
house, but neither has the house owner. The latter has only the site (provided
that it belongs to him) and the building material on it, which, however,
is no longer a house. And although in the meantime the house may have brought
in a sum “which covers five or ten times the original cost price,” we shall
see that this is solely due to an increase of ground rent. This process
is a secret to no one in such cities as London where the landowner and
the house owner are usually two different persons. Such tremendous rent
increases occur in rapidly growing towns, but not in a village, where the
ground rent for building sites remains practically unchanged. It is indeed
a notorious fact that, apart from increases in the ground rent, rents produce
on an average no more than seven per cent per annum on the invested capital
(including profit) for the house owner, and out of this sum, repair costs,
etc., must be paid. In short, the rent agreement is quite an ordinary commodity
transaction which is, theoretically speaking, of no greater and no lesser
interest to the worker than any other commodity transaction, with the exception
of that which concerns the buying and selling of labor power, and, practically,
the worker comes face to face with the rent agreement as one of the thousand
forms of bourgeois cheating which I dealt with on page 4 of the reprint,
but even then, as I proved there, it is subject to economic regulation.</p>
<p>Mülberger, on the other hand, regards the rent agreement as nothing
but pure “arbitrariness” (page 19 of the reprint) and when I prove the
contrary to him he complains that I am telling him “all sorts of things
which unfortunately” he “already knew.” </p>
<p>But with all the economic investigations into house rent we are
not able to turn the abolition of the rented dwelling into “one of the
most fruitful and magnificent efforts which has ever sprung from the womb
of the revolutionary idea.” In order to accomplish this we must translate
the simple fact from sober economics into the far more ideological sphere
of legal talk. “The house serves as a perpetual legal title” to house rent,
and “<i>thus it comes about</i>” that the value of a house can be paid back in
rent two, three, five or ten times. In order to discover how it really
comes about, the “legal title” does not help us in the least and therefore
I said that Mülberger would have been able to find out how it “thus comes
about” by first of all inquiring how the house becomes a legal title. We
discover this only after we have examined, as I did, the economic nature
of house rent, instead of getting angry at the legal expression under which
the ruling class sanctions it. Whoever proposes the taking of economic
steps to abolish rent ought surely, first of all, to know more about house
rent than that it is “the tribute which the tenant must pay to the perpetual
title of capital.” But to this Mülberger answers, “a description is one
thing, an explanation another.” </p>
<p>We have, therefore, converted the house, although it is by no
means everlasting, into a perpetual legal title to house rent. We find
no matter how “it thus comes about,” that by virtue of this legal title,
the house brings in its original value several times over in the form of
rent. By the translation into legal phraseology we are happily so far removed
from economics that we can see no more than the phenomenon that a house
can gradually get paid for in gross rent several times over. As we are
thinking and talking in legal terms, we apply to this phenomenon the measure
of equality and justice, and we discover that it is unjust, that it is
not in accordance with the “conception of justice of the revolution,” whatever
kind of a thing that may be, and that therefore the legal title is no good.
We find further that the same holds good for interest-bearing capital and
leased agricultural land, and we now have the excuse for separating these
classes of property from the others and subjecting them to exceptional
treatment. This consists in the demands: 1. to deprive the owner of the
right to give notice, the right to demand the return of his property; 2.
to give the lessee, borrower or tenant the use without payment of the object
handed over to him, but not belonging to him; and 3. to pay off the owner
in installments over a long period without interest. And with this we have
exhausted the Proudhonist “principles” from this angle. This is Proudhon’s
 “social liquidation.” </p>
<p>Incidentally, it is obvious that this whole reform plan is to
benefit almost exclusively the petty bourgeois and the small peasants in
that it consolidates them in their position as petty bourgeois and small
peasants. Here we can observe that “the petty bourgeois, Proudhon,” who
is a mythical figure according to Mülberger, suddenly takes on a very tangible
historical existence.</p>
<p>Mülberger continues:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “When I say with Proudhon that the economic life of society should
 be pervaded by a conception of justice, then I am describing
 present-day society as one in which, it is true, not all
 conceptions of justice are absent, but in which the conception of
 justice of the resolution is absent, a fact which even Engels will
 admit.” </p>
<p class="fst">
Unfortunately I am not in a position to do Mülberger this favor. Mülberger
demands that society should be pervaded with a conception of justice, and
calls that a description. If a court sends a bailiff to me with a summons
for the payment of a debt, then, according to Mülberger, it is doing no
more than describing me as a man who does not pay his debts! A description
is one thing, and a presumptuous demand is another. And precisely therein
lies the essential difference between German scientific socialism and Proudhon.
We describe – and despite Mülberger every real description is at the same
time an explanation – economic relationships as they are and as they are
developing, and we provide the proof, strictly economically, that their
development is at the same time the development of the elements of a social
revolution, the development on the one hand of a class whose conditions
of life necessarily drive it to social revolution, the proletariat, and
on the other hand of productive forces which, having grown beyond the framework
of capitalist society, must necessarily burst that framework, and which
at the same time offer the means for abolishing class differences once
and for all in the interests of social progress itself. Proudhon, on the
contrary, demands from present-day society that it shall transform itself
not according to the laws of its own economic development, but according
to the prescriptions of justice (the “conception of justice” does not belong
to him, but to Mülberger). Where we prove, Proudhon, and with him Mülberger,
<i>preaches</i> and laments.</p>
<p>What kind of a thing “the conception of justice of the revolution” 
is, I am quite unable to guess. Proudhon, it is true, makes a sort of goddess
out of “<i>the</i> Revolution,” the bearer and executor of his “Justice” in doing
which he then falls into the peculiar error of mixing up the bourgeois
revolution of 1739-94 with the coming proletarian revolution. He does this
in almost all his works and particularly since 1848; 1 shall quote only
one as an example, namely, the “<i>Idée générale de la révolution</i>,” pages
39 and 40 of the 1868 edition. As, however, Mülberger rejects all and every
responsibility for Proudhon I am not allowed to explain “the <i>conception</i>
of justice of the revolution” from Proudhon and remain therefore in Egyptian
darkness. Mülberger says further:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “But neither Proudhon nor I appeal to an ‘eternal justice’ in
 order thereby to explain the existing unjust conditions, or even
 expect, as Engels imputes to me, the improvement of these
 conditions from the appeal to this justice.” </p>
<p class="fst">
Mülberger apparently reckons on the fact that, “in Germany Proudhon is
as good as unknown.” In all his works Proudhon measures all social, legal,
political and religious propositions by the measure of “justice,” and condemns
or recognizes them according to whether they conform or do not conform
to what he calls “justice.” In the “Contradictions economiques” this justice
is still called “eternal justice,” “justice eternelle.” Later on, nothing
more is said about eternity, but the idea remains in essence. For instance,
in “De la Justice dans la Revolution et dans l’Eglise,” 1858 edition, the
following passage is the text of the whole three-volume sermon (Vol. 1,
page 42):</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “What is the basic principle, the organic, regulating, sovereign
 principle of all societies, the principle which subordinates all
 others to itself, which rules, protects, represses, punishes, and
 in case of need even suppresses all rebellious elements? Is it
 religion, idealism or interest? In my opinion this principle is
 justice. What is justice? It is the essence of humanity itself.
 What has it been since the beginning of the world? Nothing. What
 should it be? Everything.” </p>
<p class="fst">
Justice which is the essence of humanity itself, what is that if it is
not eternal justice? Justice which is the organic, regulating, sovereign
basic principle of all societies, which has nevertheless been nothing up
to the present, but which ought to be everything – what is that if it
is not the standard with which to measure all human affairs, if it is not
the final arbiter to be appealed to in all conflicts? And did I assert
anything else than that Proudhon cloaks his economic ignorance and helplessness
by judging all economic conditions not according to economic laws, but
according to whether they conform or do not conform to his conception of
this eternal justice? And what is the difference between Mülberger and
Proudhon when Mülberger demands that “all these exchanges in the life of
modern society” should be “pervaded by a conception of justice, that is
to say, if they took place always according to the strict demands of justice?” 
Is it that I can’t read, or that Mülberger can’t write?</p>
<p>Mülberger says further:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “Proudhon knows as well as Marx and Engels that the actual driving
 spirit in human society is the economic and not the juridical
 relations; he also knows that the given conceptions of justice of
 a people are only the expression, the impression, the product of
 the economic – and in particular the production relations.... In
 a word, for Proudhon justice is the historically evolved economic
 product.” </p>
<p class="fst">
If Proudhon knows all this (I am prepared to let the unclear expressions
used by Mülberger pass and take the good will for the deed), if he knows
it all “as well as Marx and Engels,” what is there left to quarrel about?
However, the situation is in fact somewhat different with regard to Proudhon’s
science. The economic relations of a given society present themselves in
the first place as interests. But in the passage which has just been quoted
from his main work, Proudhon says in so many words that the “regulating,
organic, sovereign basic principle of all societies, the principle which
subordinates all others to itself” is not interest, but justice. And he
repeats the same thing in all the decisive passages of all his works, although
this does not prevent Mülberger from continuing:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “... the idea of economic justice, as it was developed by Proudhon
 most profoundly of all in La Guerre et la Paix, [War and
 Peace.-Ed.] completely coincides with that basic idea of Lassalle
 so excellently expressed by him in his foreword to the System of
 Acquired Rights.” </p>
<p class="fst">
<i>La guerre et la paix</i> is perhaps the most schoolboyish of all the many
schoolboyish works of Proudhon and I would not have expected it to be put
forward as a proof for Proudhon’s alleged understanding of the German materialist
conception of history which explains all historical events and ideas, all
politics, philosophy and religion from the material, economic conditions
of life of the historical period in question. The book is so little materialist
that it cannot even construct its conception of war without calling in
the help of the <i>creator</i>:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“However, the creator who chose this form of life
for us had his aims.” (Vol. II, page 100, 1869 edition.)</p>
<p class="fst">
On what historical knowledge the book is based can be judged from the fact that it believes
in the historical existence of the Golden Age:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“In the beginning when the
human race was thinly spread over the earth’s surface, nature supplied
its needs without difficulty. It was the Golden Age, the age of peace and
plenty.” (Ibid., page 102.)</p>
<p class="fst">Its economic standpoint is that of the crassest
Malthusianism.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“When production is doubled, the population will soon be
doubled also.” (Page 105.)</p>
<p class="fst">In what does the materialism of this book consist
then? In that it declares the cause of war to have been always and still
to be: “pauperism” (for instance, page 143). Uncle Brasig was just such
a materialist when in his 1848 speech he launched the great truth into
the world, “the cause of the great impoverishment is the great <i>pauvreté</i>.” </p>
<p>Lassalle’s <i>System of Acquired Rights</i> is caught in the trammels
not only of the whole illusion of the jurists, but also in that of the
Old-Hegelians. On page VII, Lassalle declares expressly that also “in economics
the conception of acquired right is the driving force of all further development” 
and he seeks to prove that “justice is a reasonable organism developing
out of itself” (and not therefore out of economic prerequisites). (Page
IX.) For Lassalle it is a question of evolving justice not out of economic
relations, but from</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “the concept of will itself of which the philosophy
of law is only the development and exposition.” (Page X.)</p>
<p class="fst">
What therefore is the point of bringing in the book here? The only difference between
Proudhon and Lassalle is that the latter was really a jurist and Hegelian,
while in both jurisprudence and philosophy, as in all other matters, Proudhon
was merely a dilettante.</p>
<p>I know perfectly well that Proudhon, who notoriously continually
contradicts himself, occasionally made an utterance here and there which
looked as though he explained ideas on the basis of facts, but such utterances
are without any significance as against the basic tendency of his thought,
and where they do occur they are extremely confused and inherently illogical.
At a certain, very primitive stage of the development of society, the need
arises to co-ordinate under a common regulation the daily recurring acts
of production, distribution and exchange of products, to see to it that
the individual subordinates himself to the common conditions of production
and exchange. This regulation, which is at first custom, soon becomes law.
With law, organs necessarily arise which are entrusted with its maintenance
– public authority, the state. With further social development, law develops
into a more or less comprehensive legal system. The more complicated this
legal system becomes, the more its terminology becomes removed from that
in which the usual economic conditions of the life of society are expressed.
It appears as an independent element which derives the justification for
its existence and the reason for its further development not out of the
existing economic conditions, but out of its own inner logic, or, if you
like, out of “the concept of will.” People forget the derivation of their
legal system from their economic conditions of life, just as they have
forgotten their own derivation from the animal world. With the development
of the legal system into a complicated and comprehensive whole the necessity
arises for a new social division of labor; an order of professional jurists
develops and with these legal science comes into being. In its further
development this science compares the legal systems of various peoples
and various times, not as the expression of the given economic relationships,
but as systems which find their justification in themselves. The comparison
assumes something common to them all, and this the jurists find by summing
up that which is more or less common to all these legal systems as natural
law. However, the standard which is taken to determine what is natural
law and what is not, is precisely the most abstract expression of law itself,
namely, <i>justice</i>. From this point on, therefore, the development of law
for the jurists, and for those who believe them uncritically, is nothing
more than the striving to bring human conditions, so far as they are expressed
in legal terms, into closer and closer conformity with the ideal of justice,
eternal justice. And this justice is never anything but the ideologized,
glorified expression of the existing economic relations, at times from
the conservative side, at times from the revolutionary side. The justice
of the Greeks and Romans held slavery to be just. The justice of the bourgeois
of 1789 demanded the abolition of feudalism because it was unjust. For
the Prussian Junker even the miserable Kreisordnung <span class="context">[legislation establishing
distinct local authorities.-Ed.]</span> is a violation of eternal justice. The
conception of eternal justice therefore varies not only according to time
and place, but also according to persons, and it belongs among those things
of which Mülberger correctly says, “everyone understands something different.” 
While in everyday life, in view of the simplicity of the relations which
come into question, expressions like right, wrong, justice, conception
of justice, can be used without misunderstanding even in relation to social
matters, they create, as we have seen, hopeless confusion in any scientific
investigation of economic relations, in fact, much the same confusion as
would be create in modern chemistry if the terminology of the phlogiston
theory were to be retained. The confusion becomes still worse if one, like
Proudhon, believes in this social phlogiston, “justice,” or if one, like
Mülberger, declares that the phlogiston theory no less than the oxygen
theory is perfectly correct.</p>
<p>[Before the discovery of oxygen the chemists explained the burning of
substances in atmospheric air by assuming the existence of a special igneous
substance, phlogiston, which escaped during the process of combustion.
Since they found that simple substances on combustion weighed more after
having been burned than they did before, they declared that phlogiston
had a negative weight so that a substance without its phlogiston weighed
more than one with it. In this way all the main properties of oxygen were
gradually ascribed to phlogiston, but all in an inverted form. The discovery
that combustion consists in a combination of the burning substance with
another substance, oxygen, and the preparation of this oxygen disposed
of the original assumption, but only after long resistance on the part
of the older chemists. – Note by F. Engels.]</p>
<h3><a id="s3">III</a></h3>
<p class="fst">Mülberger further complains that I called his “emphatic” utterance,</p>
<p class="quoteb">
 “that there is no more terrible mockery of the whole culture of our lauded
century than the fact that in the big cities 90 per cent and more of the
population have no place that they can call their own”</p>
<p class="fst">
 – a reactionary jeremiad. Certainly, I did. If Mülberger had confined himself, as he pretends,
to describing “the horrors of the present time” I should certainly not
have said one ill word about “him and his modest words.” In fact however,
he does something quite different; he describes these “horrors” as the
result of the fact that the workers “have no place that they can call their
own.” Whether one regrets “the horrors of the present time” as a result
of the fact that the workers no longer own their own dwellings, or, as
the Junkers do, as a result of the fact that feudalism and the guilds have
been abolished, in both cases nothing more can come of it than a reactionary
jeremiad, a song of sorrow at the coming of the inevitable, of the historically
necessary. The reactionary character of Mülberger’s attitude lies precisely
in the fact that he wishes to re-establish individual house ownership for
the workers – a matter which history has long ago put an end to – that
he can conceive of the emancipation of the workers in no other way than
by making everyone once again the owner of his own house.</p>
<p>And further:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “I declare most emphatically, the real struggle is to be waged
 against the capitalist mode of production; only by its
 transformation is an improvement of housing conditions to be hoped
 for. Engels sees nothing of all this.... I presuppose the whole
 solution of the social question in order to be able to proceed to
 the abolition of the rented dwelling.” </p>
<p class="fst">
Unfortunately, I still see nothing of all this even now. It is surely impossible
for me to know what someone, whose name I did not even know, presupposes
in the secret recesses of his mind. All I can do is to stick to the printed
articles of Mülberger. And there I find even today (pages 15 and 16 of
the reprint) that Mülberger, in order to be able to proceed to the abolition
of the rented dwelling, presupposes nothing more than the rented dwelling
itself. Only on page 17 does he take “the productivity of capital by the
horns,” and we shall come back to this later. Even in his answer he confirms
this when he says: </p>
<p class="quoteb">
“It was rather a question of showing how under existing
conditions a complete transformation in the housing question can be achieved.” </p>
<p class="fst">
Under existing conditions, and by the transformation (it should be abolition)
of the capitalist mode of production, are surely things diametrically opposed.</p>
<p>No wonder Mülberger complains when I regard the philanthropic
efforts of Dollfus and other manufacturers to assist the workers to obtain
houses of their own as the only possible practical realization of his Proudhonist
projects. If he were to realize that Proudhon’s plan for social salvation
is a fantasy resting completely on the basis of bourgeois society, then
he would naturally not believe in it. I have never at any time called his
good will into question. But why then does he praise Dr. Reschauer for
proposing to the Vienna Town Council that it should imitate the projects
of Dollfus?</p>
<p>Mülberger further declares:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “As far as the antithesis between town and country is particularly
 concerned. It is utopian to want to abolish it. This antithesis
 has become a natural, or more correctly, a historical one. The
 question is not one of abolishing this antithesis, but of finding
 political and social forms in which it would be harmless, indeed
 even fruitful. In this way it would be possible to expect a
 peaceful solution, a gradual balancing of interests.” </p>
<p class="fst">
So the abolition of the antithesis between town and country is utopian,
<i>because</i> this antithesis has become a natural, or more correctly, a historical
one. Let us apply this same logic to other antitheses in modern society
and see where we arrive then. For instance:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “As far as the antithesis between the capitalists and the wage
 workers is particularly concerned, it is utopian to want to
 abolish it. This antithesis has become a natural, or more
 correctly, a historical one. The question is not one of abolishing
 this antagonism, but of finding political and social forms in
 which it would be harmless, indeed even fruitful. In this way it
 would be possible to expect a peaceful solution, a gradual
 balancing of interests.” </p>
<p class="fst">
And with this we have once again arrived at Schulze-Delitzsch.</p>
<p>The abolition of the antithesis between town and country is no
more and no less utopian than the abolition of the antithesis between capitalists
and wage workers. From day to day it is becoming more and more a practical
demand of both industrial and agricultural production. No one has demanded
this more energetically then Liebig in his writings on the chemistry of
agriculture, in which his first demand has always been that man shall give
back to the land what he takes from it, and in which he proves that only
the existence of the towns, and in particular the big towns, prevents this.
When one observes how here in London alone a greater quantity of manure
than is produced by the whole kingdom of Saxony is poured away every day
into the sea with an expenditure of enormous sums, and when one observes
what colossal works are necessary in order to prevent this manure from
poisoning the whole of London, then the utopian proposal to abolish the
antithesis between town and country is given a peculiarly practical basis.
And even comparatively insignificant Berlin has been wallowing in its own
filth for at least thirty years.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is completely utopian to want, like Proudhon,
to transform present-day bourgeois society while maintaining the peasant
as such. Only as uniform a distribution as possible of the population over
the whole country, only an integral connection between industrial and agricultural
production together with the thereby necessary extension of the means of
communication – presupposing the abolition of the capitalist mode of production
 – would be able to save the rural population from the isolation and stupor in which
it has vegetated almost unchanged for thousands of years. It is not utopian
to declare that the emancipation of humanity from the chains which its
historic past has forged will only be complete when the antithesis between
town and country has been abolished; the utopia begins when one undertakes
 “from existing conditions” to prescribe the form in which this or any other
of the antitheses of present-day society is to be solved. And this is what
Mülberger does by adopting the Proudhonist formula for the solution of
the housing question.</p>
<p>Mülberger then complains that I have made him to a certain extent
co-responsible for “the monstrous views of Proudhon on capital and interest” 
and declares:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “I presuppose the alteration of the production relations <i>as an
 accomplished fact</i>, and the transitional law regulating the rate of
 interest does not refer to production relations, but to the social
 turnover, to the conditions of circulation.... The alteration of
 production relations, or, as the German school says more
 accurately, the abolition of the capitalist mode of production.
 certainly does not result, as Engels <i>tries to make me say</i>, from a
 transitional law abolishing interest, but from the <i>actual seizure
 of all the instruments of labor</i>, from the seizure of industry as a
 whole by the working people. Whether in this the working people
 will pay allegiance (!) more to the idea of gradual redemption or
 immediate expropriation is not for either Engels or myself to
 decide.” </p>
<p class="fst">
I rub my eyes in astonishment. I have read Mülberger’s article through
once again from beginning to end in order to find the passage where he
presupposes as an accomplished fact, “the actual seizure of all the instruments
of labor... the seizure of industry as a whole by the working people,” 
as a prerequisite for redemption of the rented dwelling, but I have been
unable to find it. It does not exist. There is nowhere mention of “actual
seizure,” etc., but there is the following:</p>
<p class="qutoeb"> “Let us now assume that the productivity of capital <i>is really
 taken by the horns</i>, as it must be sooner or later, for instance <i>by
 a transitional law which fixes the interest on all capitals at one
 per cent</i>, but mark you, with the tendency to make even this rate
 of interest approximate more and more to the zero point.... Like
 all other products, houses and dwellings are naturally also
 included within the framework of this law.... We see, therefore,
 that from this angle the redemption of the rented dwelling <i>is a
 necessary consequence of the abolition of the productivity of
 capital in general</i>.” </p>
<p class="fst">
Thus, it is said here in plain words, quite contrary to Mülberger’s latest
about-face, that the productivity of capital, by which confused phrase
he admittedly means the capitalist mode of production, is really “taken
by the horns” by the law abolishing interest, and that precisely as a result
of this law, “the redemption of the rented dwelling is a necessary consequence
of the abolition of the productivity of capital in general.” Not at all,
says Mülberger now. That transitional law “does not refer to <i>production</i>
relations, but to the conditions of <i>circulation</i>.” In view of this crass
contradiction, as Goethe would say, “equally mysterious for wise men as
for fools,” all that is left for me is to assume that I have to do with
two separate and distinct Mülbergers, one of whom complains with justification
that I have “tried to make him say” what the other one caused to be printed.</p>
<p>It is certainly true that the working people will ask neither
me nor Mülberger whether in the actual seizure it will “pay allegiance
more to the idea of gradual redemption or immediate expropriation.” In
all probability it will prefer not to “pay allegiance” at all. However,
there was never any question of the actual seizure of all the instruments
of labor by the working people, but only of Mülberger’s assertion (page
17) that “the whole content of the solution of the housing question is
given in the expression: gradual redemption.” And if he now declares this
gradual redemption to be extremely doubtful, what was the reason for giving
ourselves and our readers all the unnecessary trouble?</p>
<p>For the rest, it must be pointed out that the “actual seizure” 
of all the instruments of labor, the seizure of industry as a whole by
the working people, is the exact contrary of the Proudhonist theory of
 “gradual redemption.” Under the latter the individual worker becomes the
owner of the dwelling, the peasant farm, the instruments of labor; under
the former the “working people” remain the collective owners of the houses,
factories and instruments of labor and would hardly permit their use, at
least in a transitional period, by individuals or associations without
compensation for the cost. Just as the abolition of property in land is
not the abolition of ground rent, but its transfer, although in a modified
form, to society. The actual seizure of all the instruments of labor by
the working people therefore does not at all exclude the retention of the
rent relations.</p>
<p>In general, the question is not whether the proletariat when it
comes to power will simply seize by force the tools of production, the
raw materials and means of subsistence, whether it will pay immediate compensation
for them, or whether it will redeem property therein by installments spread
over a long period. To attempt to answer such a question in advance and
for all cases would be utopia-making, and I leave that to others.</p>
<h3><a id="s4">IV</a></h3>
<p class="fst">It has been necessary to write very much in order to work our way finally
through Mülberger’s evasions and twistings to the real point at issue,
a point which Mülberger carefully avoids touching on in his answer.</p>
<p>What were Mülberger’s positive statements in his articles?</p>
<p>Firstly: that “the difference between the original cost price
of a house, building site, etc., and its present value” belongs by right
to society. In the language of economics, this difference is called ground
rent Proudhon also wants to appropriate this for society, as one may read
in his “<i>Idée générale de la révolution</i>,” page 219 of the 1868 edition.</p>
<p>Secondly: that the solution of the housing question consists in
everyone being the owner instead of the tenant of his dwelling.</p>
<p>Thirdly: that this solution takes place by the passing of a law
turning rent payments into installment payments on the purchase price of
the dwelling. These points 2 and 3 are both taken from Proudhon as anyone
can see in the “<i>Idée générale de la révolution</i>,” page 199 et seq., where
on page 203 a project of the law in question is to be found already drafted.</p>
<p>Fourthly: that the productivity of capital is taken by the horns
by a transitional law reducing the rate of interest temporarily to one
per cent, subject to reducing it still further later on. This point has
also been taken from Proudhon and can be read in detail on pages 182 to
186 of the <i>Idée générale de la révolution</i>.</p>
<p>With regard to each of these points I have cited the passage of
Proudhon where the original of the Mülberger copy is to be found, and I
ask now whether I was justified in calling the author of a series of articles
containing completely Proudhonist and nothing but Proudhonist views, a
Proudhonist or not? Nevertheless Mülberger complains about nothing more
bitterly than that I call him a Proudhonist because I “came upon a few
expressions such as are peculiar to Proudhon!” Quite the contrary. The
expressions all belong to Mülberger, their content belongs to Proudhon.
And when I then supplement the Proudhonist articles from Proudhon himself,
Mülberger complains that I am ascribing to him “the monstrous ideas” of
Proudhon!</p>
<p>What did I reply to this Proudhonist plan?</p>
<p>Firstly: that the transfer of ground rent to the state is identical
with the abolition of individual property in land.</p>
<p>Secondly: that the gradual redemption of the rented dwelling and
the transfer of property in the dwelling to the tenants does not at all
affect the capitalist mode of production.</p>
<p>Thirdly: that with the present development of large-scale industry
and towns, this proposal is as absurd as it is reactionary, and that the
reintroduction of ownership of his dwelling by each individual would be
a step backward.</p>
<p>Fourthly: that the compulsory reduction of the rate of interest
on capital would by no means attack the capitalist Mode of production,
and that, on the contrary, as the usury laws prove, the idea is as old
as it is impossible.</p>
<p>Fifthly: that the abolition of interest on capital by no means
abolishes the payment of rent for houses.</p>
<p>Mülberger has now admitted points 2 and 4. To the other points
he makes no reply whatever. Nevertheless, these are just the points around
which the whole debate centered. Mülberger’s answer, however, is not a
refutation; it carefully avoids dealing with all economic points, which
are, of course, the decisive ones. It is a personal complaint, nothing
more. For instance, he complains when I anticipate his promised solution
of other questions, for instance, state debts, private debts and credit,
and say that the solution would be the same in each case as his solution
of the housing question, namely, the abolition of interest, the transformation
of interest payments into installments for paying off the capital sum,
and free credit. Nevertheless, I am still ready to bet that if these articles
of Mülberger ever see the light of day, their essential content will coincide
with Proudhon’s <i>Idée générale de la révolution</i>: credit, page 182; state
debts, page 186; private debts, page 196; just as his articles on the housing
question coincided with the passages I have quoted from the same book.</p>
<p>Mülberger takes this opportunity of informing me that questions
such as taxation, state debts, private debts and credit, to which is now
added the question of municipal autonomy, are of the greatest importance
to the peasant and for propaganda in the countryside. To a great extent
I agree, but, 1. up to the moment there has been no mention of the peasant,
and 2. Proudhon’s “solutions” of all these questions are just as absurd
economically and just as essentially bourgeois as his solution of the housing
question. <i>I</i> need hardly defend myself against Mülberger’s suggestion that
I fail to appreciate the necessity of drawing the peasants into the movement.
However, I certainly consider it folly to recommend to them for this purpose
the Proudhonian quackery. There is still very much large-scale landed property
in Germany. According to Proudhon’s theory all this ought to be divided
up into small peasant farms, which, in the present state of agriculture
and after the experience of small landownership in France and in Western
Germany, would be positively reactionary. The large-scale landed estates
which still exist will rather afford us a welcome opportunity of conducting
agriculture on a large scale – the only way which can utilize modern equipment
machinery, etc. – by associated workers, and thus demonstrating to the
small peasants the advantages of large-scale enterprise by means of associations.
The Danish socialists, who in this respect are ahead of all others, have
realized this long ago.</p>
<p>It is equally unnecessary for me to defend myself against the
suggestion that I regard the existing infamous housing conditions as “an
insignificant detail.” As far as I know, I was the first to describe in
German these conditions in their classical form as they exist in England.
I did not do that, as Mülberger suggests, because they “violated my sense
of justice” – whoever insisted on writing books about all the facts which
violated his sense of justice would have a lot to do – but as can be read
in the introduction to my book, by describing the social conditions created
by modern large-scale industry, to provide an actual basis for German socialism,
which was then arising and was expending itself in empty phrases. However,
it does not occur to me to try to solve the so-called housing question
any more than I occupy myself with the details of the still more important
food question. I am satisfied if I can prove that the production of our
modern society is sufficient to provide all its members with enough to
eat, and that there are houses enough in existence to provide the working
masses for the time being with roomy and healthy living accommodation.
To speculate as to how a future society would organize the distribution
of food and dwellings leads directly to utopia. The utmost we can do is
to note, from an understanding of the basic conditions of all modes of
production up to now, that with the downfall of the capitalist mode of
production certain forms of appropriation by society hitherto will become
impossible. Even the transitional measures will everywhere have to be in
accordance with the conditions in existence at the moment; in countries
of small-scale landownership quite different from those in countries where
large-scale landownership prevails, etc. Mülberger himself shows us better
than anyone else where one arrives at if one attempts to find isolated
solutions for so-called practical questions, such as the housing question,
when he takes 28 pages to explain to us that, “the whole content of the
solution of the housing question is given in the expression: gradual redemption,” 
but who, when one presses him hard, begins to stammer in embarrassment
that it is really very doubtful whether, when it comes to a question of
the actual seizure of the houses, “the working people will pay allegiance
more to the idea of gradual redemption” or to some other form of expropriation.</p>
<p>Mülberger demands that we should become practical, that we should
not “come forward merely with dead and abstract formulas” when “faced with
real practical conditions,” that we should, “proceed beyond abstract socialism
and <i>come close to the definite concrete conditions of society</i>.” If Mülberger
had done this himself he might perhaps have rendered great service to
the movement. The first step in coming close to the definite and concrete
conditions of society is surely that one should learn what they are, that
one should examine them according to their existing economic interrelations.
But what do we find in Mülberger’s articles? Two whole sentences, namely:</p>
<p class="quoteb">1. “As the wage worker in relation to the capitalist, so is the
tenant in relation to the house owner.” </p>
<p class="fst">
I have already, proved on page six of the reprint that this is totally false, and Mülberger has not a word to say in reply.</p>
<p class="quoteb">2. “However, the bull which” (in any social reform)
 “must be taken by the horns is <i>the productivity of capital</i>, 
 as the liberal school of political
economy calls it, a thing which <i>in reality does not exist</i>, but which in
its apparent existence serves as a cloak for all the inequality which burdens
present-day society.”</p>
<p class="fst">
Thus, the bull which has to be taken by the horns
 “<i>in reality does not exist</i>,” and therefore also has no “horns.” Not the
bull itself is the ; evil, but, its “<i>apparent existence</i>.” Despite this,
 “the so-called productivity” (of capital) “is able to conjure up houses
and towns” whose existence is anything but “apparent.” And a man who,
although Marx’s <i>Capital</i> “is familiar also to him,” jabbers in this hopelessly confused fashion about the relation of capital and labour, takes on the
task of showing the German workers a new and better path, and presents
himself as the “master builder” who is </p>
<p class="quoteb">
“clear about the architectural structure
of the future society at least in its main outlines!” </p>
<p class="fst">
No one has come closer “to the definite and concrete conditions
of society” than Marx in Capital. He spent twenty-five years in investigating
them from all angles, and the results of his criticism contain throughout
the kernels of so-called solutions, in as far as they are possible at all
today. But that is not enough for friend Mülberger. That is all abstract
socialism, dead and abstract formulas. Instead of studying “the definite
and concrete conditions of society” for himself, friend Mülberger contents
himself with reading through a few volumes of Proudhon which, although
they offer him next to nothing concerning the definite concrete conditions
of society, do offer him very definite and concrete miraculous remedies
for all social evils. He then presents this ready-made plan for social
salvation, this Proudhonian system, to the German workers under the pretext
that <i>he</i> wants “to say good-bye to the <i>systems</i>,” 
while I “choose the
opposite path.” In order to grasp this I must assume that I am blind and
Mülberger deaf so that any understanding between us is utterly impossible.</p>
<p>But enough. If this polemic serves for nothing else it has the
value in any case of having provided proof of how impractical these so-called
 “practical” socialists really are. These practical proposals for the abolition
of all social evils, these universal social panaceas, have always and everywhere
been the work of sectarians who appeared at a time when the proletarian
movement was still in its infancy. Proudhon also belongs among them. The
development of the proletariat soon casts aside these swaddling-clothes
and produces in the working class itself the understanding that nothing
is less practical than these “practical solutions,” concocted in advance
and universally applicable, and that practical socialism consists rather
in a correct knowledge of the capitalist mode of production from all its
various sides. A working class which is secure in this knowledge will never
be in doubt in any given case against which social institutions, and in
what manner, its main attacks should be directed.</p>

<p class="fst">Dear Kugelmann</p>
<p>My best thanks for the gift of £15 for Jennychen. I have worked myself so hard that today (in two hours) I am leaving London with Engels for four or five days, and going to the sea (Ramsgate). From the date of my return until 2 September (the International Congress at the Hague) I shall have my hands more than full, but from then on I shall again be more free. But this freedom will only begin in the middle of September, because I shall myself go to the Hague.</p>
<p>Perhaps we could see each other later (that is, you could see me, for I would not be safe in Germany).</p>
<p class="sig">Adio<br>
Yours<br>

<p>As soon as the first instalments (German or French) are out, you will of course receive them. <sup class="enote"><a href="#n1">[1]</a></sup> <i>I am highly dissatisfied with Meissner</i>. <sup class="enote"><a href="#n2">[2]</a></sup> He has led me by the nose  –  first overworked me due to the sudden and unexpected haste with which he announced the second edition (end of November 1871); then lost months and let the best time slip by. He is a wretched little philistine.</p>
<p>To punish Meissner it would be good if <i>you were to write him</i>, on the pretext of wanting to know when the ‘first’ instalment will finally appear. You can then remark, quite in passing, that from my last letters it seemed to you that I am very embittered against Meissner and very dissatisfied with him; what is the reason for that? It is not my usual manner! The fellow has really annoyed me very much by his ‘if you don’t come today, come tomorrow’ manner.</p>

<p class="information">The majority of the following were written during
the second European-Chinese War. Marx and Engels both contributed to a
series of articles for the New York <i>Daily Tribune</i> spanning several
years — though the byline was always Marx's. These articles were part
of that journalistic flow.</p>
<p class="information">
China was, at this time, in upheaval. It was the most populous
region in the world (400 million people in 1834). The "Celestial Empire"
had long operated with trade surpluses, but by the 1840s, serious trade
deficits plagued China. The first European-Chinese conflict (The Opium
War) began in 1839 and ended with the 1842 Treaty of Nanking. During
this period, famines wracked the land. It is estimated maybe 14 million
people died in 1849, and another 20 million between 1854 and 1860.</p>
<p class="information">
At the same time, the Taiping rebellion broke out in 1850 and
attacked the status quo Confucianist Manchu Dynasty -- which had ruled
since 1644. The rebellion was based in social revolutionary ideas of equality
and was popular among the masses. It abolished private property, established
sexual equality, and banned drugs (from alcohol to opium). By 1853, it dominated
much of SE China. It would not be until 1864 that the Taiping capital of
Nanking was captured by the imperial Manchu government.</p>
<p class="information">
The "Lorcha War" (also sometimes called the Second Opium War)
ran from 1856-58. It began over the "mistreatment" of a British flag on
a Chinese junk, or a "lorcha." It officially ended with the 1858 Treaty
of Tientsin.</p>
<p class="information">
In 1860, Beijing was sacked by the Europeans. However, the Europeans
generally supported the Manchu Dynasty against the Taiping rebels, preferring
to keep the government installed for fear of what chaos the rebels might
bring to trade relations. The Manchu dynasty would not fall until 1911
revolution, when the entire dynastic system collapsed with the provisional
government of Sun Yat Sen.</p>

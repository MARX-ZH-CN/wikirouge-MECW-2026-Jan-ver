<h4>[London,] 30 September 1853, 28 Dean Street, Soho</h4>
<p>Dear Frederic,</p>
<p>Your piece on the war <span class="context">[<i>The Russians in Turkey</i>]</span> is capital. I myself had serious <strong>misgivings</strong> about the westward advance of the <strong>Russian forces</strong> but did not, of course, dare <strong>trust to my judgment</strong> in such matters. I have already written a whole series of <strong>strike</strong> articles, produced at intervals throughout the 6 months during which the thing has been going on. Now, however, the affair has taken a new <strong>turn</strong>. In the article where I used your <strong>strike-generalities</strong>, I have mentioned a host of <strong>strike-localities</strong> by <i>name</i>, also the Preston  and Wigan affairs. I couldn’t get hold of any particulars about Manchester. I have depicted the manoeuvring in Preston (very briefly, mind you) 1. as an attempt by the manufacturers to use the operatives, whose demands are forcing the closure of the <strong>mills</strong>, to <i>cover</i> their <i>retreat</i> from over-production; 2. as an attempt to <strong>starve the operatives into submission</strong>.</p>
<p>As you can see, <strong>my history of strikes</strong> goes no further than last Tuesday and doesn’t touch on Manchester.</p>
<p>You might, perhaps, expand somewhat the notes on yarn and <strong>cotton</strong> prices and, if possible, the price of <strong>goods</strong>, so that they amount to at least one paragraph of an article.</p>
<p>In each article, besides the subject proper, I naturally have to follow step by step the Russian Notes and England’s <strong>foreign policy</strong> (and right brave it is!), since the <i>jackasses </i>in New York consider this to be of prime importance and, <strong>after all</strong>., nothing is easier to write about than this business of <strong>high</strong> politics.</p>
<p>Next Tuesday <i>week </i>I shall have finished an article on the ‘<strong>Oriental Church’,</strong> and <i>next Friday</i> <i>week </i>the first of three articles on Denmark where next month the various assemblies of estates will be again taking the stage.</p>
<p>Should there be any military <strong>movement</strong>, I shall count on receiving immediate information from the Ministry of War in Manchester, and the same applies to <strong>cottons</strong> and <strong>yarns</strong> which are wretchedly covered by the papers down here.</p>
<p>Above all I want to slay the fellows with my pen, the moment being propitious, and if at the same time you keep me supplied with material, I can spin out the various themes over longer periods. What is more, without my secretary <span class="context">[Pieper]</span> I feel a little nervous about my English.</p>
<p><i>No</i> regards to Lupus.</p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>

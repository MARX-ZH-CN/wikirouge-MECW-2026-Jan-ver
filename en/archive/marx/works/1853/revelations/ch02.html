<p class="title">Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne by Karl
Marx 1853</p>
<h1>II The Dietz Archive</h1>
<p class="fst">The document found in the possession of the accused, the
<i>Manifesto of the Communist Party</i>, which had been printed before the
February revolution and had been available from booksellers for some years,
could neither in its form nor in its aims be the programme of a
“plot”. The confiscated <i>Addresses </i>of the Central Authority
were concerned exclusively with the relations of the Communists to the future
democratic government and therefore not to the government of Frederick William
IV. Lastly, the “Rules” were indeed the rules of a secret
propaganda society, but the <i>Code pénal</i> prescribes no penalties for
secret societies. The ultimate aim of this propaganda is said to be the
destruction of existing society; but the Prussian state has already perished
once and could perish ten times more and indeed for good and all without the
existing social order being even the slightest bit harmed. The Communists can
help accelerate the dissolution of bourgeois society and yet leave the
dissolution of the Prussian state in the hands of bourgeois society. If a man
whose immediate aim was the overthrow of the Prussian state were to preach the
destruction of the social order as a means to this end he would be like that
deranged engineer who wished to blow up the whole planet in order to remove a
rubbish-heap.</p>
<p>But if the final goal of the League is the <i>overthrowing of the social
order</i>, the method by which this is to be achieved is necessarily that of
<i>political revolution</i> and this entails the overthrow of the Prussian
state, just as an earthquake entails the overthrow of a chicken-house. The
accused, however, proceed in fact from the outrageous assumption that the
present Prussian government would collapse without their having to lift a
finger. They accordingly did not found a league to overturn the present
government of Prussia, and were not guilty of any “treasonable
conspiracy”.</p>
<p>Has anyone ever accused the early Christians of aiming at the overthrow of
some obscure Roman prefect? The Prussian political philosophers from Leibniz to
Hegel have laboured to dethrone God, and if I dethrone God I also dethrone the
king who reigns by the grace of God. But has anyone ever prosecuted them for
<i>lèse-majesté</i> against the house of Hohenzollern?</p>
<p>From whatever angle one looked at it, when the <i>corpus</i> <i>delicti
</i>was subjected to public scrutiny it vanished like a ghost. The complaint
of the indictment board that there was “<i>no</i> <i>indictable
offence</i>” remained valid and the “Marx party” was
spiteful enough to refrain from providing <i>one single iota for the
indictment </i>during the whole year and a half of the preliminary
investigation.</p>
<p>Such an embarrassing situation had to be remedied. The Willich-Schapper
party, in conjunction with the police, remedied it.</p>
<p>Let us see how Herr Stieber, the midwife of this party, introduces it into
the trial in Cologne. (See Stieber’s testimony in the sitting of October
18, 1852.)</p>
<p>While Stieber was in London in the spring of 1851, allegedly to protect the
visitors to the Great Exhibition from pilferers and thieves, the Berlin police
headquarters sent him a copy of the papers found in Nothjung’s home.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“<i>In particular</i>,” Stieber swore,
“my attention was directed to the conspirators’ archive which
according to <i>papers found in Nothjung’s home were in the possession
of a certain Oswald Dietz in London and which would undoubtedly contain the
whole correspondence of the League’s members</i>.”</p>
<p>The conspirators’ archive? The whole correspondence of the
League’s members? But Dietz was the secretary of the Willich-Schapper
Central Authority. If the archive of a conspiracy was in his possession it was
the archive of the Willich-Schapper conspiracy. If Dietz had correspondence
belonging to the League it could only be the correspondence of the separate
league that was hostile to the accused in Cologne. But even more became clear
from the scrutiny of the documents found in Nothjung’s home, namely that
nothing in them points to the fact of Oswald Dietz being the keeper of an
archive. Moreover, how should Nothjung, who was in Leipzig, know what was not
even known to the “<i>Marx</i> party” in London?</p>
<p>Stieber could not say outright: Now note this, Gentlemen of the jury! I have
made amazing discoveries in London. Unfortunately they refer to a conspiracy
with which the accused in Cologne have nothing to do and which it is not the
task of the Cologne jury to judge, but which provided a pretext for keeping the
accused in solitary confinement for one and a half years. Stieber could not say
this. The intervention of Nothjung was indispensable to create even the
semblance of a connection between the revelations and documents from London and
the trial in Cologne.</p>
<p>Stieber then swore on oath that a man offered to buy the archive for cash
from Oswald Dietz. The plain fact is that a certain Reuter, a Prussian police
spy who has never belonged to a communist society, lived in the same house as
Dietz and, during the latter’s absence, broke into his desk and stole his
papers. That Herr Stieber paid him for the theft is quite credible, but this
would hardly have protected Stieber from a journey to Van Diemen’s Land
<span class="context">[i.e., Tasmania, to which British convicts were
transported]</span> if the manoeuvre had become public knowledge while he was
in London.</p>
<p>On August 5, 1851, Stieber, who was in Berlin, received from London the
Dietz archive, “in a bulky parcel wrapped in stout oil-cloth”,
which turned out to be a heap of documents consisting of “60 separate
items”. To this Stieber could swear, and at the same time he swore that
the parcel he received on August <i>5</i>, 1851 contained also letters from
the leading district in Berlin dated August <i>20</i>, 1851. If someone were
to assert that Stieber was perjuring himself when he claimed that he received
on August 5, 1851 letters dated August 20, 1851, Stieber would justly retort
that a royal Prussian counsellor, like the Evangelist Matthew, has the right to
perform chronological miracles.</p>
<p><i>En passant</i>. From the list of documents stolen from the
Willich-Schapper party and from the dates of these documents it follows that
although the party had been warned by Reuter’s burglary, it still
constantly found ways and means of having its documents stolen and allowing
them to fall into the hands of the Prussian police.</p>
<p>When Stieber found himself in possession of the treasure wrapped in stout
oil-cloth he was beside himself with joy. “The whole network,” he
swore, “lay revealed before my eyes.” And what did the
treasure-trove contain about the “Marx party” and the accused in
Cologne? According to Stieber’s own testimony, nothing at all except
for</p>
<p class="quoteb">“the original of a declaration by several members of
the Central Authority, who obviously formed the nucleus of the ‘Marx
party’; it was dated London, September 17, 1850, and concerned their
resignation from the communist society consequent on the well-known breach of
September 15, 1850”.</p>
<p>Stieber says so himself but even in this simple statement he is unable
simply to confine himself to the facts. He is compelled to raise them to a
higher plane in order to make them truly worthy of the police. For the original
declaration contained nothing more than a statement of three lines to the
effect that the majority members of the former Central Authority and their
friends were resigning from the <i>public Workers’ Society </i>of Great
Windmill Street<sup class="enote"><a href="footnote.html#269" target=_blank>[269]</a></sup>;
but they did not resign from a “<i>communist society</i>”.</p>
<p>Stieber could have spared his correspondents the oil-cloth and his
authorities the postal dues. He had only to ‘rummage’ [<span class="context">a pun on Stieber's name</span>] through the various German
papers of September 1850 and he would have found in black and white the
declaration of the “nucleus of the Marx party” announcing their
resignation from the Refugee Committee and also from the Workers’ Society
of Great Windmill Street.</p>
<p>The immediate product of Stieber’s researches was then the amazing
discovery that the “nucleus of the Marx party” had resigned from
the public Society of Great Windmill Street on September 17, 1850. “The
whole network of the Cologne plot lay revealed before his eyes.” But the
public couldn’t believe their eyes.</p>

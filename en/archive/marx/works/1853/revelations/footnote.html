<p class="title">Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne by Karl
Marx 1853</p>
<h1>Footnotes</h1>
<a id="265"></a>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">265</span> The reference here is to the
Willich-Schapper group, which Marx and Engels called the Sonderbund - perhaps
an allusion to the separatist union of the seven economically backward Catholic
cantons of Switzerland formed in the 1840s to resist progressive bourgeois
reforms. This sectarian-adventurist group split away from the Communist League
after September 15, 1850, and formed an independent organisation with its own
Central Authority. In view of the factionalists’ refusal to abide by the
decision to transfer the Central Authority to Cologne and because of their
disorganising activities, on November 11, 1850 the London District proposed to
the Cologne Central Authority to expel the members of the Sonderbund from the
League (see present edition, Vol. 10, p. 633). The Central Authority endorsed
the proposal and gave notification of this in its Address of December 1. By
their activities the members of the Willich-Schapper group helped the Prussian
police to discover the League’s illegal communities in Germany and frame
a case in Cologne in 1852 against prominent members of the League. </p>
<a id="269"></a>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">269</span> The reference is to the German
Workers’ Educational <i>Society </i>in London which was founded in
February 1840 by Karl Schapper, Joseph Moll and other members of the League of
the Just (an organisation of German artisans and workers and also of emigrant
workers of other nationalities). After the reorganisation of the League of the
Just in the summer of 1847 and the founding of the Communist League, the
League’s local communities played the leading role in the Society. During
various periods of its activity, the Society had branches in working-class
districts in London. In 1847 and 1849-50 Marx and Engels took an active part in
the Society’s work, but on September 17, 1850 Marx, Engels and a number
of their followers withdrew because the Willich-Schapper sectarian and
adventurist faction had temporarily increased its influence in the Society,
causing a split in the Communist League. In the late 1850s Marx and Engels
resumed their work in the Educational Society, which existed up to 1918, when
it was closed down by the British Government. </p>
<a id="274"></a>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">274</span> Marx emphasises the fact that
Cherval was admitted into the League of the Just prior to its reorganisation
into the Communist League in June 1847. Though Marx and Engels were not members
of the League of theJust, founded in 1836, they were in touch with its leaders.
They agreed to join the League and take part in its reorganisation provided it
became transformed from a conspiratorial society into an association built on
democratic principles, and provided it adopted the principles of scientific
communism as its programme.</p>
<a id="276"></a>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">276</span> Marx adduced fresh data exposing
Cherval as a spy and an <i>agent provocateur </i>in his, work <i>Herr
Vogt</i>, in the appendices to it, and in the Postscript to the 1875 edition
of his <i>Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne</i>.
According to these data, Cherval, whose real name was Joseph Crémer, was an
agent of the Prussian envoy in Paris and a French spy. He escaped from prison
with the connivance of the French and Prussian police. On his arrival in London
in May 1852 he was admitted into the German Workers’ Educational Society
led by Schapper but was soon expelled from it because of his role of
provocateur in the case of the so-called German-French plot.</p>
<a id="277"></a>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">277</span> The reference is to the book
<i>Die Communisten-Verschwörungen des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts</i> (Berlin,
Part One 1853, Part Two 1854) by the police officials Wermuth and Stieber. In
his article “On the History of the Communist League” (1885), Engels
describes it as a “crude compilation, which bristles with deliberate
falsifications, fabricated by two of the most contemptible police scoundrels of
our century”. The appendices to the first part, which purported to tell
the history of the workers’ movement for the information of police
agents, reproduced some of the League’s documents that had fallen into
the hands of the police. The second part contained a “black list”
and biographical particulars of people connected with the workers’ and
democratic movement.</p>
<a id="281"></a>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">281</span> This refers to the workers’
society founded in London in January 1852 with Marx’s support, its
president being a Hanoverian refugee, the joiner Gottlieb Stechan. It included
workers who broke away from the German Workers’ Educational Society,
which had come under the influence of the Willich-Schapper group. Georg
Lochner, a worker close to Marx and Engels and member of the Communist League,
also took an active part in organising this society. Later, many of its
members, including Stechan himself, became influenced by the Willich-Schapper
group and joined the earlier organisation. </p>
<a id="282"></a>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">282</span> Among Marx’s manuscripts is
preserved a draft in Marx’s own hand of a reply to Stieber which contains
a sharp accusation of him as a police spy (see present edition, Vol. 38). The
letter refutes Stieber’s attempts to dispute the revelations concerning
his activities as a spy, in particular in Silesia before the revolution of
1848-49, made in a report from Frankfurt am Main which was published in issue
No. 177 of the <i>Neue Rheinische </i>Zeitung on December 24, 1848 under the
title “Dr. Stieber”. Concerning Stieber’s attempts to depict
himself as a more consistent democrat than representatives of the democratic
trends and his attacks against the latter, Marx limited himself to this remark:
“We excuse the lectures on democracy and democratic organs contained in
your letter on the grounds of novelty.” At the same time the editors of
the newspaper thought fit to publish, in a supplement to issue No. 182,
December 30, an official correction to the passage of the above-mentioned
report which said that Stieber went to Frankfurt in connection with the popular
uprising in September 1848, and pointed out that he went there to arrange
personal matters.</p>
<p>The reply to Stieber drafted by Marx was in all probability sent over the
signature of another editor of the <i>Neue Rheinische </i>Zeitung, most
likely Wilhelm Wolff, who may have been well aware of Stieber’s activity
in Silesia. </p>
<a id="283"></a>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">283</span> Engels refers to the first
supplement to the 1875 and 1885 editions of the <i>Revelations Concerning
</i><i>the Communist Trial in Cologne</i>, which reproduced without the
title Appendix 4 (“The Communist Trial in Cologne”) to Marx’s
pamphlet <i>Herr Vogt </i>(1860). It said that soon after the Cologne trial
Fleury was charged with forgery and sentenced to several years’ penal
servitude. </p>
<a id="284"></a>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">284</span> In the Postscript to the 1875
edition of his work Marx pointed out that the <i>Red Catechism</i> had been
written not by Moses Hess but by a certain Levy. However, it turned out later
that Marx had been right in affirming that the <i>Red </i><i>Catechism</i>
had in fact been written by Hess. This can he proved in particular by a letter
of Hess to Weydemeyer of July 21, 1850, which Marx did not know about.</p>
<a id="285"></a>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">285</span> The reference is apparently to the
German-American Revolutionary Association - an organisation of German emigrants
in the USA founded in January 1852 by the petty-bourgeois democrats Goegg and
Fickler who went to the USA to place the so-called German-American
revolutionary loan. </p>
<a id="287"></a>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">287</span> Criticism of the behaviour of the
leader of the sectarian group and some of his followers during the Cologne
Communist trial evoked a mordant reaction on the part of Willich. On October 28
and November 4, 1853 he published his article “Doctor Karl Marx und seine
‘Enthüllungen'” (<i>Belletristisches Journal und New-Yorker
Criminal-Zeitung</i>, Nos. 33 and 34) violently attacking Marx and his work
<i>Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne</i>. Marx replied
with his pamphlet <i>Knight</i> <i>of Noble Consciousness </i>published
with the help of Adolf Cluss and Joseph Weydemeyer in New York in January
1854.</p>

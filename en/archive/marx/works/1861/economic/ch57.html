Marx first describes the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, on the basis of the decreasing proportion of capital invested in wages, in <i>The Grundrisse</i>, <a href="../../1857/grundrisse/ch15.html" target=_blank>Notebook VII</a>, written February - March 1858. The idea is completed in <a href="../../1894-c3/ch13.html" target=_blank>Volume III</a> of <i>Capital</i>, put together from Marx's notes by Engels and published in 1894.</p>
<hr class="end"/>
<p class="fst">We have seen (6 g)) that real profit — i.e. the current average profit and its rate — is different for the individual capital from profit, and therefore from the rate of profit, in so far as the latter consists of the surplus value really produced by the individual capital and the rate of profit therefore = the ratio of the surplus value to the total amount of the capital advanced. But it was also shown that considering the sum total of the capitals which are employed in the various particular spheres of production, the total amount of the social capital, or, and this is the same thing, the <i>total capital of the capitalist class, </i>the average rate of profit is nothing other than the total surplus value related to and calculated on this total capital; that it is related to the total capital exactly in the way in which profit — and therefore the rate of profit — is related to the individual capital, in so far as profit is considered only as surplus value which has been converted formally. Here, therefore, we once again stand on firm ground, where, without entering into the competition of the many capitals, we can derive the general law directly from the general nature of capital as so far developed. This law, and it is the most important law of political economy, is that the <i>rate of profit has a tendency to fall with the progress of capitalist production.</i></p>
<p><span class="context">[XVI-1000]</span><a id="XVI-1000"></a> Since the general rate of profit is nothing but the ratio of the total amount of surplus value to the total amount of capital employed by the capitalist class, we are not concerned here with the different branches into which surplus value is divided, such as industrial profit, interest, rent. Since all these different forms of surplus value are only components of the total surplus value, one part may increase because the other declines. We are concerned here, however, with a fall in the rate of the total surplus value. Even the rent of land — as Adam Smith has already correctly noted — falls with the development of capitalist production, instead of rising, not in proportion to the particular area of land of which it <i>appears </i>to be the product, but in proportion to the <i>capital </i>invested in agriculture, therefore precisely in the form in which it steps forth directly as a component of surplus value. This law is confirmed by the whole of modern agronomy. (See Dombasle, Jones, etc.)</p>
<p>So where does this tendency for the general rate of profit to fall come from? Before this question is answered, one may point out that it has caused a great deal of anxiety to bourgeois political economy. The whole of the Ricardian and Malthusian school is a cry of woe over the day of judgement this process would inevitably bring about, since capitalist production is the production of profit, hence loses its stimulus, the soul which animates it, with the fall in this profit. Other economists have brought forward grounds of consolation, which are not less characteristic. But apart from theory there is also the practice, the crises from superabundance of capital or, what comes to the same, the mad adventures capital enters upon in consequence of the lowering of [the] rate of profit. Hence crises — see Fullarton — acknowledged as a necessary violent means for the cure of the plethora of capital, and the restoration of a sound rate of profit.</p>
<p>//Fluctuations in the rate of profit, independent of organic <strong>changes</strong> in the components of capital, or of the absolute magnitude of capital, are possible if the <i>value </i>of the capital advanced, whether it is engaged in the form of fixed capital, or exists as raw material, finished commodities, etc., rises or falls in consequence of an increase or reduction, independent of the already existing capital, in the labour time needed for its <i>reproduction, </i>since the value of every commodity — hence also of the commodities of which the capital consists — is conditioned not only by the necessary labour time contained in it itself, but by the necessary — socially necessary — labour time which is required for its <i>reproduction </i>and this reproduction may occur under circumstances which hinder or facilitate it, and are different from the conditions of the original production. If under the changed circumstances twice as much labour time, or, inversely, half as much, is generally required to reproduce the same capital, as was needed to produce it, that capital, presupposing that the value of money remains permanently unchanged, would now be worth 200 thalers, if it was previously worth 100, or, if it was previously worth 100, it might now only be worth 50. If this increase or decline in value were to affect uniformly all sections of capital, profit too, like the capital, would now be expressed in twice as many or in half as many thalers. The rate would remain unchanged. 5 is related to 50 as 10 to 100 or 20:200. Let us assume however that the nominal value of fixed capital and raw material alone rises, and that they form 4/5 of 100, hence 80, the variable capital forming 1/5, hence 20. In this case the surplus value, hence the profit, would continue to be expressed in <span class="context">[XVI-1001]</span><a id="XVI-1001"></a> the same sum of money. Thus the rate of profit would have risen or fallen. In the first case surplus value = 10 thalers, which makes 10% on 100. But the 80 are now worth 160, hence the total capital = 180. 10 on 180 = 1/18 = 100/18 = 100: 18 = 5 = 5 5/9 %, instead of the previous 10 %. In the second case 40 instead of 80, the total capital = 60, on which 10 = 1/6 = 100/6. 100:6 = 16 = 16 2/3 %. But these fluctuations can never be general, unless they affect the commodities which enter into the worker’s consumption, hence unless they affect variable capital, hence the whole of capital. In this case, however, the rate of profit remains unchanged, even though the amount of profit has changed nominally. //</p>
<p>The general rate of profit can never rise or fall through a rise or fall in the total value of the capital advanced. If the value of the capital advanced, expressed in money, rises, the nominal monetary expression of the surplus value rises too. The rate remains unchanged. Ditto in the case of a fall.</p>
<p>The general rate of profit can only fall:</p>
<p>1) if the absolute magnitude of surplus value falls. The latter has, inversely, a tendency to rise in the course of capitalist production, for its growth is identical with the development of the productive power of labour, which is developed by capitalist production;</p>
<p>2) because the ratio of variable capital to constant capital falls. As we have seen, the rate of profit is always smaller than the rate of surplus value which is expressed in it. But the larger the ratio of constant to variable capital, the smaller it is. Or, the same rate of surplus value is expressed in a rate of profit which is the smaller, the larger the ratio of the total amount of capital advanced to the variable part of the latter, or the greater a part the constant capital forms of the total capital. Surplus value expressed as profit is <i>S</i>/(<i>C</i>+<i>v</i>), and the larger<i> C </i>is, the smaller this magnitude, and the more it diverges from <i>S</i>/<i>v</i> the rate of surplus value. For <i>S</i>/(<i>C</i>+<i>v</i>) would reach its maximum when<i> C </i>= 0, hence <i>S</i>/(<i>C</i>+<i>v</i>) = <i>S</i>/<i>v</i>.</p>
<p>But the law of development of capitalist production (see Cherbuliez , etc.) consists precisely in the continuous decline of variable capital, i.e. the part of capital laid out in wages, in return for living labour — the variable component of capital — in <i>relation </i>to the constant component of capital, i.e. to the part of capital which consists in fixed capital and in the <strong>circulating capital</strong> laid out for raw material and <i>matierès instrumentales. </i>The whole development of relative surplus value, i.e. of the productive power of labour, i.e. of capital, consists, as we have seen, in the curtailment of necessary labour time, hence also the reduction of the total amount of the capital exchanged for labour, through the increase in the production of surplus labour by means of division of labour, machinery, etc., cooperation, and the expansion in the amount of value and the mass of constant capital expended which this involves, accompanied by a reduction in the capital expended for labour.</p>
<p>So when the ratio of variable capital to the total amount of capital alters, the rate of profit falls, i.e. the ratio of surplus value to the total capital is the smaller, <span class="context">[XVI-1002]</span><a id="XVI-1002"></a> the smaller the ratio of variable capital to constant capital.</p>
<p>If, for example, in the production of India the ratio of the capital laid out as wages to the constant capital = 5:1, and in England it is 1:5, it is clear that the rate of profit in India must appear much larger, even if the surplus value actually realised is much smaller. Let us take 500. If the variable capital = 500 /5 = 100, the surplus value 40, the rate of surplus value will be 40%, the rate of profit only 10%. In contrast, if the variable part is 400 and the rate of surplus value is only 20%, this would make 80 on 400, and on 500 a rate of profit of 80:500, of 8:50. 8:50 = 16:100. Therefore 16%. (100:16 = 500:80 or 50:8 = 250:40 or 25:4 = 125:20. 25×20 = 500. 4×125 = 500.) So although labour would be twice as strongly exploited in Europe as in India, the rate of profit in India would be related to the rate of profit in ‘Europe as 16:10, as 8:5, = 1:5/8. Hence as 1:0,625. And indeed this is because 4/5 of the total capital is exchanged for living labour in India, and only 1/5 in Europe. If real wealth appears slight in those countries where the rate of profit is high, it is because the productive power of labour is slight, a fact which is expressed precisely in the high rate of profit. 20% is 1/5 on labour time, hence India could only feed 1/5 of the population not directly involved in the product; whereas 40% is 2/5, hence in England twice the proportion of the population could live without working.</p>
<p>The tendency towards a fall in the general rate of profit therefore = the development of the productive power of capital, i.e. the rise in the ratio in which objectified labour is exchanged for living labour.</p>
<p>The development of productive power has a double manifestation: [Firstly,] in the magnitude of the productive forces already produced, in the amount of value and the physical extent of the conditions of production under which new production takes place, i.e. the absolute magnitude of the productive capital already accumulated. Secondly, in the relative smallness of the capital laid out for wages, in comparison with the total capital, i.e. the relatively small amount of living labour which is required for the reproduction and exploitation of a large capital — for mass production.</p>
<p>This implies, at the same time, the concentration of capital in large amounts at a small number of places. The same capital is large if it employs 1,000 workers united into a single labour force, small if it is divided into 500 businesses employing two workers apiece.</p>
<p>If the ratio of the variable part of capital to the constant part, or to the total capital, is large, as in the above example, this shows that all the means towards the development of the productivity of labour have not been employed, that, in a word, the <i>social forces </i>of labour have not been developed, that therefore with a large quantity of labour little is produced, <span class="context">[XVI-1003]</span><a id="XVI-1003"></a> whereas in the opposite case a (relatively) large amount is produced with a small amount of labour.</p>
<p>The development of fixed capital (which produces of itself a development of the circulating capital laid out in raw material and <i>matierès instrumentales </i>(<i>see Sismondi</i>) is a particular symptom of the development of capitalist production. It implies a direct reduction, relatively speaking, of the variable part of capital, i.e. a lessening in the quantity of living labour. The two are identical. This is most striking in agriculture, where the reduction is not only relative but absolute.</p>
<p>// Adam Smith’s idea that the general rate of profit is forced down by competition — on the presupposition that capitalists and workers alone confront each other — or that the division of surplus value among different classes is not further considered — comes down to saying that profit does not fall because wages rise; but wages do indeed rise because profit falls, hence it is — from the point of view of the result, an increase in wages corresponding to the fall of profit — the same mode of explanation as Ricardo’s completely opposite one, in which profit falls because wages become more expensive, etc., or as Carey’s, because there is an increase not only in costs of production (exchange value) but in the use value of the wage. That profit <strong>temporarily</strong> falls as a result of competition between capitals — i.e. their competition in the demand for labour — is admitted by all political economists (see <i>Ricardo</i>). Adam Smith’s explanation, if he did not speak of industrial profits only, would raise this to a general law very contradictory to the laws of wage[s] developed by himself.//</p>
<p>The development of productive power has a double manifestation: in the increase of surplus labour, i.e. the curtailment of the necessary labour time; and in the reduction of the component of capital which is exchanged with living labour, relatively to the total amount of capital, i.e. the total value of the capital which enters into production. (See <i>Surplus Value, Capital</i>, etc.) Or, expressed differently: It is manifested in the greater exploitation of the living labour employed (this follows from the greater quantity of use values which it produces in a given time, <i>hinc </i>the curtailment of the time required for the reproduction of the wage, <i>hinc </i>the prolongation of the labour time appropriated by the capitalist without equivalent) and in the reduction in the relative amount of living labour time which is employed in general — i.e. in its amount relatively to the capital that sets it in motion. Both movements not only go [hand in hand] but condition each other. They are only different forms and phenomena in which the same law is expressed. But they work in opposite directions, in so far as the rate of profit comes into consideration. Profit is surplus value related to the total capital, and the rate of profit is the ratio of this surplus value, calculated according to a particular measure of the capital, e.g. as a percentage. However, surplus value — as an overall quantity is determined firstly by its rate, but secondly by the amount 0 labour employed simultaneously at this rate, or, and this is the same thing, the magnitude of the variable part of the capital. On the one hand there is a rise in the rate of surplus value, on the other hand there is a (relative) fall in the numerical factor by which this <strong>rate</strong> is multiplied. In so far as the development of productive power lessens the necessary (paid) part of the labour employed, it raises the surplus value, because it raises its rate, or it raises it when expressed as a percentage. However, in so far as it lessens the total amount of labour employed by a given capital, it reduces the numerical factor by which the rate of surplus value is multiplied, hence it reduces its amount.</p>
<p>Surplus value is determined both by the rate, which expresses the ratio of surplus labour to necessary labour, and by the amount’ of working days employed. However, with the development of the productive forces, the latter — or the variable part of the capital — is reduced in relation to the capital laid out.</p>
<p>If<i> C </i>= 500,<i> c </i>= 100,<i> v </i>= 400, and<i> S </i>= 60, s/v = 60 /400 = 15%, so that the rate of profit = 60 /500 = 12%. <span class="context">[XVI-1004]</span><a id="XVI-1004"></a> Furthermore, if<i> C </i>= 500,<i> c </i>= 400,<i> v </i>= 100, and<i> S </i>= 30, SI, = 30/ 100 = 30%, so that the rate of profit = 30/500 = 6%. The rate of surplus value is doubled, the rate of profit is halved. The rate of surplus value exactly expresses the rate at which labour is exploited, while the rate of profit expresses the relative amount of living labour employed by capital at a given rate of exploitation, or the proportion of the capital laid out in wages, the variable capital, to the total amount of capital advanced.</p>
<p>If<i> C </i>= 500,<i> c </i>= 400, and<i> v </i>= 100, for the rate of profit to be 12% or profit to be 60, surplus value would have to be 60, <i>s</i>/<i>v</i> = 60/100 = 60%.</p>
<p>For the rate of profit to remain the same, the rate of surplus value (or the rate of exploitation of labour) would have to grow in the same ratio as the magnitude of the capital laid out in labour grows, in the same way as the magnitude of the variable capital falls relatively, or the magnitude of the constant capital grows relatively. It is already strikingly apparent from one single circumstance that this is only possible within certain limits, and that it is rather the reverse, the tendency towards a fall in profit — or a <i>relative </i>decline in the amount of surplus value hand in hand with the growth in the rate of surplus value — which must predominate, as is also confirmed by experience. The part of the value which capital newly reproduces and produces is = to the living labour time directly absorbed by it in its product. One part of this labour time replaces the labour time objectified in wages, the other part is the unpaid excess amount, surplus labour time. But both of them together form the whole amount of the value produced, and only a part of the labour employed forms the surplus value. If the normal day = 12 hours, 2 workers who perform simple labour can never add more than 24 hours (and workers who perform higher labour can never add more than 24 hours<i> x </i>the factor which expresses the ratio of their working day to the simple working day), of which a definite part replaces their wages. The surplus value they produce cannot, whatever the circumstances, be more than an aliquot part of 24 hours. If, instead of 24 workers, only 2 are employed to a given quantity of capital (in proportion to a given measure of capital), or 2 workers are necessary in the new mode of production where 24 were necessary in the old one, in proportion to a given amount of capital, then if the surplus labour in the old mode of production = 1/12 of the total working day, or = 1 hour, no increase in productive power — however much it raised the rate of surplus labour time — could have the effect that the 2 workers provided the same amount of surplus value as the 24 in the old mode of production. If one considers the development of productive power and the relatively not so pronounced fall in the rate of profit, the exploitation of labour must have increased very much, and what is remarkable is not the fall in the rate of profit but that it has not fallen to a greater degree. This can be explained partly by circumstances to be considered in dealing with competition between capitals, partly by the general circumstance that so far the immense increase of productive power in some branches has been paralysed or restricted by its much slower development in other branches, with the result that the general ratio of variable to constant capital — considered from the point of view of the total capital of society — has not fallen in the proportion which strikes us so forcibly in certain outstanding spheres of production.</p>
<p>In general, therefore: The decline in the average rate of profit expresses an increase in the productive power of labour or of capital, and, following from that, on the one hand a heightened exploitation of the living labour employed, and [on the other hand] a <i>relatively reduced amount of living labour </i>employed at the heightened rate of exploitation, calculated on a particular amount of capital.</p>
<p>It does not now follow automatically from this law that the <i>accumulation </i>of capital declines or that the absolute <i>amount </i>of <i>profit </i>falls (hence also the <i>absolute, </i>not <i>relative, amount </i>of surplus value, which is expressed in the profit).</p>
<p><span class="context">[XVI-1005]</span><a id="XVI-1005"></a> Let us stay with the above example. If the constant capital is only 1/5 of the total capital advanced, this expressed a low level of development of productive power, a limited scale of production, small, fragmented capitals. A capital of 500 of this kind, with surplus value at 15% (the variable capital at 400) gives a <i>total amount</i> of profit of 60. If we reverse the ratio, this expresses a large scale, the development of productive power, cooperation, division of labour, and large-scale employment of fixed capital. Let us therefore assume that a capital of this kind is of 20 times greater extent; 500×20 = 10,000, thus 6% profit on 10,000 (or surplus value of 30%, if the variable capital = 2,000) 600. A capital of 10,000 therefore accumulates more quickly with 6% than a capital of 500 with 12%. The one realises a labour time of 400, the other one of 2,000, hence an absolute amount of labour time 5 times greater, although relatively to its magnitude, or to a given amount of capital, e.g. 100, it employs four times less [labour time]. (See Ricardo’s example.)</p>
<p>Here, as in the whole of our analysis, we entirely disregard use value. With the greater productivity of capital it goes without saying that the same value employed at the more productive scale represents a much greater amount of use value than it does at the less productive scale, and therefore also provides the material for a much more rapid rate of growth of the population and consequently of labour powers. (See <i>Jones</i>.)</p>
<p>This fall in the rate of profit leads to an increase in the <i>minimum amount of capital</i> — or a rise in the level of concentration of the means of production in the hands of the capitalists — required in general to employ labour productively, both to exploit it, and to employ no more than the labour time socially required for the manufacture of a product. And there is a simultaneous growth in accumulation, i.e. concentration, since large capital accumulates more rapidly at a small rate of profit than does small capital at a large rate of profit. Once it has reached a certain level, this rising concentration in turn brings about a new fall in the rate of profit. The mass of the lesser, fragmented capitals are therefore ready to take risks. <i>Hinc</i> crisis. The so-called plethora of capital refers only to the plethora of capital for which the fall in the rate of profit is not counterbalanced by its size. (See Fullarton.)</p>
<p>Profit, however, is the driving <strong>agency</strong> in capitalist production, and only those things are produced which can be produced at a profit, and they are produced to the extent to which they can be produced at a profit. Hence the anxiety of the English political economists about the reduction in the rate of profit.</p>
<p>Ricardo already noted that the increase in the amount of profit accompanying a decline in the rate of profit is not absolute, but that there may be a decline in the amount of profit itself, despite the growth of capital. Strangely enough, he <i>did </i>not grasp this in general, but merely gave an example. Nevertheless, the matter is very simple.</p>
<p>500 at 20% gives 100 profit.</p>
<p>50,000 at 10% gives 5,000 profit; but 5,000 at 2% would only give 100 profit, no more than 500 gives at 20%, and at 1% it would only give 50 profit, hence only half as much as 500 at 20%. <i>In general</i>: As long as the rate of profit falls more slowly than capital grows, there is a rise in the amount of profit and therefore the rate of accumulation, although relative profit declines. If the profit were to fall to the same degree as the capital grew, the amount of profit would, despite the growth in capital, remain the same as it was with a higher rate of profit on a smaller capital. This would therefore also be true of the rate of accumulation. Finally, if the rate of profit fell in a greater proportion than the growth in capital, the amount of profit and therewith the rate of accumulation would fall along with the rate of profit, and it would stand lower than in the case of a smaller capital with a higher rate of profit at a correspondingly less developed stage of production.</p>
<p><span class="context">[XVI-1006]</span><a id="XVI-1006"></a> //We do not consider use value at all, except in so far as it determines the production costs of labour capacity or the nature of capital, as with fixed capital, because we are considering capital in general, not the real movement of capitals or competition. But it may be remarked here in passing that this production on a large scale, with a higher rate of surplus value and a reduced rate of profit, presupposes an immense production, and therefore consumption, of use values, hence always leads to periodic overproduction, which is periodically solved by expanded markets. Not because of a lack of demand, but a lack of paying demand. For the same process presupposes a proletariat on an ever-increasing scale, therefore significantly and progressively restricts any demand which goes beyond the necessary means of subsistence, while it at the same time requires a constant extension of the sphere of demand. Malthus was correct to say that the <i>demand of the worker</i> <i>can never suffice for the capitalist. </i>His profit consists precisely in the excess of the worker’s supply over his demand. Every capitalist grasps this as far as his own workers are concerned, only not for the other workers, who buy his commodities. Foreign trade, luxury production, the state’s extravagance (the growth of state expenditure, etc.) — the massive expenditure on fixed capital, etc. — hinder this process. (Hence sinecures, extravagance on the part of the state and the unproductive classes, are recommended by Malthus, Chalmers, etc., as a nostrum.) It remains curious that the same political economists who admit the periodic overproduction of capital (a periodic plethora of capital is admitted by all modern political economists) deny the periodic overproduction of commodities. As if the simplest analysis did not demonstrate that both phenomena express <i>the same antinomy, </i>only in a different form.//</p>
<p>That this mere possibility disturbs Ricardo (Malthus and the <strong>Ricardians</strong> similarly) shows his deep understanding of the conditions of capitalist production. The reproach that is made against him, that in examining capitalist production he is unconcerned with “human beings”, keeping in view the development of the productive forces alone — bought at the cost of whatever sacrifices — without concerning himself with distribution and therefore consumption, is precisely what is great about him. <i>The development of the productive forces of social labour is the historic</i> task and justification of capital. It is exactly by doing this that it unconsciously creates the material conditions for a higher mode of production. What makes Ricardo uneasy here is that profit — the stimulus of capitalist production and the condition of accumulation, as also the driving force for accumulation — is endangered by the law of development of production itself. And the quantitative relation is everything here.</p>
<p>There is in reality a deeper basis for this, which Ricardo only suspects. What is demonstrated here, in a <i>purely economic </i>manner, from the standpoint of capitalist production itself, is its barrier — its <i>relativity, </i>the fact that it is not an <i>absolute, </i>but only an historical <i>mode of production, </i>corresponding to the material conditions of production of a certain restricted development period.</p>
<p>To bring this important question to a decisive conclusion, the following must first be investigated:</p>
<p>1) Why does it happen that with the development of fixed capital, machinery, etc., the passion for overwork, prolongation of the normal working day, in short the mania for <i>absolute surplus labour </i>grows, along with precisely the mode of production in which <i>relative surplus labour is </i>created?</p>
<p>2) How is it that in capitalist production <i>profit </i>appears — from the point of view of the individual capital, etc. — as a <i>necessary condition of production, </i>hence as forming part of the absolute production costs of capitalist production?</p>
<p>If we take surplus value, its rate is greater, the smaller the variable capital in proportion to it, and less, the larger the variable capital.<i> s</i>/<i>v </i>rises or falls inversely as<i> v </i>rises or falls. If<i> v </i>= 0, this [s] would be at its maximum, for no outlay of capital for wages would be necessary, no labour would have to be paid in order to appropriate unpaid labour. Inversely: the expression <i>s</i>/(<i>c</i>+<i>v</i>) or the rate of profit, would be at its maximum if<i> c </i>= 0, that is, if the rate of profit = the rate of <span class="context">[XVI-1007]</span><a id="XVI-1007"></a> surplus value, i.e. if no constant capital<i> c </i>at all had to be laid out in order to lay out capital<i> v </i>in</p>
<p>wages and thus realise it in surplus labour. The expression<i> s</i>/(<i>c</i>+<i>v</i>) therefore rises and falls inversely as<i> c </i>rises or falls, hence it also rises or falls against <i>v</i>.</p>
<p>The rate of surplus value is greater, the smaller the variable capital in proportion to the surplus value. The rate of profit is greater, the greater the variable capital in proportion to the total capital, and this proportion is greater the smaller the constant capital in proportion to the total capital, hence also in the proportion to which it forms a smaller part of the total capital than the variable capital. But the variable capital for its part is smaller in proportion to the total capital, the greater the proportion of the total capital and therefore of the constant capital to the variable capital.</p>
<p>Assume<i> s </i>= 50,<i> v </i>= 500,<i> c </i>= 100. Then <i>s</i>' = 50/500 = 5/50 = 1/10 = 10%. And Pp. (rate of profit) 50/600 = 5 /60 = 1/12 = 8 1/3%. Hence <i>s</i>/<i>v</i> is greater, the smaller<i> v </i>is, — is greater, if<i> s </i>is given, the greater <i>v</i> is and the smaller<i> c </i>is, but <i>s</i>/<i>v</i> increases when<i> c </i>increases. If now <i>s</i>/<i>v</i> becomes 3 <i>s</i>/<i>v</i>, and<i> c </i>grow 3 times, so that 3<i>s</i>/(3<i>c</i>+<i>v</i>) which was originally related</p>
<p> to<i> c </i>as <i>v</i>: (<i>v</i>+<i>c</i>)</p>

<p><i>v</i> = (<i>c</i>-<i>v</i>)/(<i>v</i>+<i>c</i>) and<i> v </i>= (<i>c</i>-<i>v</i>)/(<i>v</i>+3<i>c</i>)</p>
<p><i>v</i> = <i>c</i>/(!+<i>c</i>/<i>v</i>) <i>v</i> = <i>c</i>/((1+3<i>c</i>/<i>v</i>)</p>
<p>If<i> s </i>became greater than<i> v </i>in the measure to which<i> c </i>grew or<i> v </i>becomes greater than <i>c</i>+<i>v</i>, hence if the rate of surplus value grew through greater employment of constant capital in the same measure as the proportion of variable capital to total capital declines, the rate of profit would remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Originally we had <i>s</i>/(<i>c</i>+<i>v</i>) = <i>p</i>'. Now we have 3<i>s</i>/(3<i>s</i>+<i>v</i>) = <i>p</i>'.</p>
<p>The first question is by how much<i> s</i>/(3<i>c</i>+<i>v</i>) [is less than] <i>s</i>/(<i>c</i>+<i>v</i>),</p>
<p>s/(<i>c</i>+<i>v</i>) — s/(3<i>c</i>+<i>v</i>) = <i>s</i>(3<i>c</i>+<i>v</i>)-<i>s</i>(<i>c</i>+<i>v</i>)/(<i>c</i>+<i>v</i>)(3<i>c</i>+<i>v</i>)</p>
<p>= <i>s</i>(3<i>c</i>+<i>v</i>-<i>c</i>-<i>v</i>)/(<i>c</i>+<i>v</i>)(3<i>c</i>+<i>v</i>) = <i>s</i>(2<i>c</i>)/(<i>c</i>+<i>v</i>)(3<i>c</i>+<i>v</i>)</p>
<p><span class="context">[XVI-1008]</span><a id="XVI-1008"></a> Let surplus value = 120. Variable capital = 600. In this case <i>s</i>', or rate of surplus value, = 120/600 = 20%. If the constant capital = 200, then <i>p</i>' = 120/800 = 12/80 = 3/20 = 15%. If now the constant capital is increased threefold, from 200 to 600, and everything else remains unchanged, then <i>s</i>' = 20% as before, but <i>p</i>' now = 120/ 1,200 12 /120 = 6/60 = 3/30 = 1/10 = 10%. The rate of profit would have fallen from 15 to 10 [per cent], by 1/3; the constant capital would have tripled. The variable capital was previously 100/800 = 6/8 = 3/4 of the total capital, it is now 600/1,200, only 1/2 or 2/4, it has therefore become smaller by 2/3.</p>
<p>But if the surplus value increased threefold through the tripling of the constant capital, i.e. if it grew from 120 to 120×3 = 360, then <i>s</i>' would now = 360 /600 = 16 /60 = 6/10 = 3/5 = 60%, and <i>p</i>' would = 360/1,200 = 36/120 = 6/20 = 3/10 = 30%.</p>
<p>But since the variable capital is now related to the total capital as 600:1,200, whereas previously it was as 600:800, it is now 1/2 of the total capital, and was previously 6/8 or 3/4, so it has fallen.</p>
<p><span class="context">[XVI-1009]</span><a id="XVI-1009"></a><i> s </i>= 120,<i> v </i>= 600,<i> c </i>= 200.<i> s </i>= 120/600 = 20%, <i>p</i>' = 120/800 = 15 %. </p>
<p><i>s</i> = 120.<i> v </i>= 600.<i> c </i>= 600. <i>s</i>' = 120/600 = 20%. <i>p</i>' = 120/1,200 = 10%.</p>
<p>15:10 = 3:2 = 1:2/3. Hence <i>p</i>' has fallen by 1/3,<i> c </i>has risen 3 times, total capital has grown from 800 to 1,200, by 1/2; finally<i> v </i>was originally related to<i> c </i>as 600:200 = 3x200 = 3c, but now = <i>v</i>. Hence<i> v </i>has fallen 3fold against <i>c</i>. Finally<i> v </i>was previously related to<i> c </i>as 600:800 = 6:8 = 3:4 = 3 /4 <i>c</i>. Now it is related as 600:1,200 = 6:12 = 2:4; = 1/2 or 2 /4<i>c</i>. Hence it has fallen against<i> c </i>by 1/4.</p>
<p>For the rate of profit to remain the same at 15%, the surplus value would have to rise from 120 to 180, hence by 60 (but 60:120 = 1:2), hence by a half. Furthermore, [a rise in] <i>s</i>' from 120/600 or 20% to 180/600 or 30%, from 20 to 30, is again [a rise] by 50%.</p>
<p>The surplus value had to increase in the same proportion as the total capital grew from 800 to 1,200, i.e. by 50%, that is it had to increase from 20 to 30%. Originally<i> v </i>was 3 /4 of the total capital, now it is 2/4. But 3/4 <i>C</i>×20 is as much as 2/4 <i>C</i>×30, namely — 60<i>C</i>/4 (=15%).</p>
<p class="indentb">[<span class="context">[...]</span> that the sum of surplus value not only does not fall, but rises <span class="context">[...]</span> to the actual rate [of surplus value] depends on the number of workers employed, that with the use of machinery, due to the action of the laws inherent  in machine production, the productive application <span class="context">[...]</span> , the better division of labour and combination of labour due to fixed capital, grows.]</p>
<p>//It is self-evident that the variable capital may constantly grow in the absolute sense, i.e. the absolute number of workers may grow, although it is constantly falling in proportion to total capital and fixed capital. Hence the inane dispute over whether machinery reduces the number of workers. It almost always reduces the number when introduced, not in the sphere in which it has itself been introduced, but through the suppression of workers who carry on the same industry at the previous stage of production. For example the machine spinners drive out the hand spinners, the machine weavers the hand weavers, etc. But in the branch of industry which employs the machinery the number of workers may grow constantly in the absolute sense // although here men are often driven out by <strong>women</strong> and <strong>young persons</strong> // although it declines relatively. //</p>
<p><span class="context">[XVI-995]</span> Let us first assemble the facts.</p>
<p><i>C</i> = <i>v</i>+<i>c</i>.<i> s </i>= surplus value. <i>s</i>' = rate of surplus value. <i>p</i>' = rate of profit. <i>s</i>' = <i>s</i>/<i>v</i>, <i>p</i>' = <i>s</i>/<i>c</i> or<i> s</i>/<i>v</i>+<i>c</i>.</p>
<p><span class="context">[...]</span></p>
<p><i>C</i> = 800.<i> c </i>= 200.<i> v </i>= 600.<i> s </i>= 120. In this case,<i> C </i>= 1/4<i> C </i>(800/4 = 200) and<i> v </i>= 3/4<i> C</i> (=3×<span class="context">?</span>/4 =<span class="context">??</span> <i>s</i>' = 120/600 = 20%. If<i> c </i>increases from 200 to 600, by a factor of three,<i> C </i>will rise from 800 to 1,200, <i>i.e</i>. <i>by</i> 50%.</p>
<p>Since<i> C </i>= 1/4 <i>C</i>, its threefold increase causes it to grow from 1/4 to 3/4 (by 2/4). The total capital is now 3/4<i> C </i>+ 3/4<i>C</i> = 1 2/4 C. It has therefore risen by <span class="context">[...]</span>. It was originally = 3 4C ( = 600), so if it is tripled this brings it from 3/4 to 9/4, from 600 to 1,800, and it brings the total capital to 2,000 (<span class="context">[...]</span> C<span class="context">[...]</span>/<span class="context">[...]</span><i>C</i> over and above the original capital 6 /4C = 1,200 (1,200 + 800 = 2,000). How far therefore the total capital <span class="context">[...]</span> becomes <span class="context">[...]</span> growth in c, depends on the original proportion of<i> c </i>to <i>C</i> which presents itself entirely as a particular proportion between<i> c </i>and<i> v </i><span class="context">[...]</span> of <i>C</i>. So the greater the proportion of c:<i> v </i>or of <i>c</i>:<i> C </i>(<i>c</i>+<i>v</i>), the more does the total. amount<i> C </i>grow through <span class="context">[...]</span> the more does the rate of profit fall and the greater is the growth in the rate of surplus value required for the rate of profit to remain the same. <span class="context">[...]</span> the growth of the total capital if the rate of surplus value is given.</p>
<p>In the case of an increase of<i> C </i>from 800 to 1,200, of<i> c </i>from 200 to 600, the constant capital is tripled and the total capital grows by <span class="context">[...]</span> by 50%. In this case the rate of surplus value or <i>s</i>' continues to be 20% and<i> s </i>= 120. But <i>p</i>' = 120 /1,200 = 10%. Surplus value and rate of surplus value <span class="context">[...]</span> have fallen from 15 to 10, i.e. by 1/3 or 33 1/3%. Why is there this difference, that the rate of profit falls by 33 1/3 % <span class="context">[...]</span> grows by 50%? Because the relation of the rate of profit expresses itself as the inverse of the relation of the two capitals we have compared. <span class="context">[...]</span> or 1,200. This growth is from 800:1,200 = 2:3, hence from 2:(2+1) or by 50%. The fall in the rate of profit expresses itself inversely, as fall of <span class="context">[...]</span> from 120/800 to 120/1,200 or 120/800:120/1,200 = 3:2; hence as a fall of 1/3 or 33 1/3%.</p>
<p>The fall in the rate of profit therefore depends directly on the growth in the total capital, if the variable capital remains the same; its fall expresses itself in inverse proportion to the growth of the capital. If <i>this grows from 2:3, the rate of profit falls from 3:2. </i>Furthermore, if the variable capital remains the same, the growth of the total capital can only derive from the growth of the constant capital. However, the proportion in which a particular increase in constant capital causes the total capital to increase depends on the original ratio between<i> c </i>and <i>C</i>. This <i>inverse relation </i>explains in part why the rate of profit does not fall in the same proportion as the capital increases, even if the rate of surplus [value] remains the same. If 2 increases to 4, that is a growth of 100%. If 4 falls to 2, that is a fall of 50%.</p>
<p>b) If in the second case indicated above the rate of profit is to remain the same, the profit, hence the surplus value, will have to rise from 120 to 180, i.e. by 60 or 1/2 of 120, rise by half its original magnitude. The surplus value would therefore have directly to <i>grow in the same proportion </i>as the total capital, by 50%, therefore rising in a greater proportion than the fall in the rate of profit, surplus value remaining the same.</p>
<p>If<i> c </i>had risen to 1,200 instead of 600, the total capital would have risen to 1,800, for<i> C </i>would have risen by 1,000, hence by 125%. <span class="context">[...]</span> remain the same, the total amount of surplus value = the total profit, would have had to rise to 270. But 270:120 must [imply] a growth of 150 <span class="context">[...]</span> or 125% on top of 120. 120 on 120 is 100%, and 30 on 120 is 1/4 or 25% (4x30 = 120) <span class="context">[...]</span> %.)</p>
<p>c) How in this case (b) would <i>s</i>' or surplus value have risen?</p>
<p>It was originally 120 /600 = 20% or 1/5 of the variable capital. If the capital grows to 1,200 or<i> c </i>is tripled, 180/600 or 30% or <span class="context">[...]</span>. In the third <strong>case</strong>, if the capital grows to 1,800, [surplus value is] 270/600 = 9/20 of the variable capital, = 45%. In [this case the rate of] surplus value has risen from 20 to 30%, i.e. by 50%, to the same degree as the total capital has grown in this case and the absolute surplus value or <span class="context">[...]</span> has risen in this case from 20 to 45; i.e. by 25; but 25:20 = 1 1/4 (20 + 1/4 20 or 5) hence 125%. (This <span class="context">[...]</span> only on the growth of the increment, not the relation of the numbers to each other as such.) The rate of surplus value would therefore have to [grow] directly [as the] total capital grew or in the same proportion as the absolute surplus value would have to grow for the rate of profit to remain unaltered with a growing <span class="context">[...]</span>.</p>
<p>Variable capital amounted to</p>
<p>Case I: 600 out of total capital constant capital  800 = 3 /4 <i>C</i>; 200 = 1/4 <i>C</i></p>
<p>Case II: 600 1,200 = 2 /4 <i>C</i>; 600 = 2/4 <i>C</i></p>
<p>Case III: 600 1,800 = 1/3 [<i>C</i>]; 1,200 = 2/3 <i>C</i></p>
<p><span class="context">[?????]</span>: 600 3,600 = 1/6 [<i>C</i>]; 3,000 = 5/6 <i>C</i>.</p>
<p>Surplus value or profit had to increase to 540; the rate of surplus value = 540/600, 9/10 or 90%. 90% against 20 <span class="context">[...]</span> of 70. But 70 to 20 would be 350%. The increase of capital would be 3,600-800 = 2,800, similarly [350%]. In this case the rate of surplus labour = 9/10 of the total working day, hence given 10 hours of labour 9 hours. <span class="context">[...]</span> <span class="context">[XVI-996]</span> <span class="context">[...]</span>, although entirely corresponding to the growth of the total capital with variable capital remaining the same, now express the rate of rise and fall inversely in the same value expression as the capital <span class="context">[...]</span>. If the capital rises from 2 to 4, the rate of profit falls from 4 to 2. The other rises by 100%, <span class="context">[...]</span></p>
<p><span class="context">[...]</span> and the rate of surplus value, which is an identical relation if variable capital remains the same, does not grow as capital grows or variable capital <span class="context">[...]</span> total capital. There is absolutely no rational reason why the rise of productive power should observe exactly the same numerical ratio. It <span class="context">[...]</span> of relative surplus value grows and its growth is expressed in the ratio of the reduction in the variable capital <span class="context">[...]</span>, but not in the same ratio as this proportion declines. Productive power grows, hence surplus labour. Firstly, there lies here <span class="context">[...]</span> the matter. One man may produce as much use value as 90. Never more than an average of 12 hours a day in value is <span class="context">[...]</span>, as this <span class="context">[...]</span> surplus value never more than <i>12 hours — x, </i>where<i> x </i>expresses the labour time necessary for his own production. The surplus value, <span class="context">[...]</span> the <i>labour time which he himself works, not by the working days he replaces. </i>If 90 men worked only % an hour of surplus time a day, this would be <span class="context">[...]</span> hours. If the one man needed only one hour of necessary labour time, he would never [produce] more than 11 hours of surplus value. The process is double. It increases the surplus labour time of the working day, but it also reduces the numerical coefficients of those working days, <span class="context">[...]</span> capital. Secondly: The development of productive power is not uniform; certain branches of industry may themselves be more unproductive but this is determined by the general productivity of capital.</p>
<p><span class="context">[...]</span> firstly at a stage of production which remains the same, without great revolutions in productive power, in proportion to its already existing <span class="context">[...]</span> only gives rise to a total capital of 2, whereas 1,000 at 10% gives 1,100. <i>c</i>. 1,100 prod[... Ex]ample of 800,<i> v </i>= 600,<i> c </i>= 200, and surplus value = 160 or rate of profit equal to 20%, a capital of 100,000 would give <span class="context">[...]</span> instead Of 3/4 only 1/6 variable, (3 /4 = 18/24, and 1/6 = 4 /24) hence employs 14 /24 or 7/ 12 less variable capital relatively speaking, at <span class="context">[...]</span> 50% it continues to be 5,000. His variable capital, and the living labour employed by it, would still be 16,6661/6 in total amount, hence <span class="context">[...]</span> it would still be nearly 28 times greater than the capital employed in the first case. But the rate of profit is determined, because the rate of surplus value is determined, by the ratio of the variable capital to the total capital. At simple interest £100,000 would grow into 200,000 in 20 years, whereas 800 at 20% would only produce an accumulation of 3,200 in 20 years (160×20). In the second 20 years 200,000 at 5% would grow to 400,000. The other capital at 20%, in contrast, would only grow to 12,800.</p>
<hr class="section"/>
<p>[<span class="greek">a</span>] As a rule // see under <i>surplus value </i>for the exception: <i>intensification of labour </i>and therefore in fact <i>increase of labour </i>by machinery // machinery only creates <i>relative surplus value </i>through the curtailment of necessary labour time and therefore the prolongation of surplus labour time. This result is brought about by the cheapening of the commodities which enter directly or indirectly into the worker’s consumption.</p>
<p>Surplus value is formed by two factors. Firstly the daily surplus labour of the individual worker. This determines the <i>rate of surplus value, </i>hence also the proportion in which variable capital is increased through the exchange with living labour. Secondly, the <i>number </i>of workers simultaneously exploited by capital or the number of simultaneous working days.</p>
<p>If the rate of surplus value is given, the magnitude of the surplus value — the surplus value itself as an independent magnitude — depends on the number of workers employed. If this [number and the number of simultaneous] working days is given, the magnitude of the surplus value depends on its rate.</p>
<p><span class="context">[...]</span> now evidently has a tendency to affect the two factors of surplus value in opposite directions. It increases the rate <span class="context">[...]</span> reduces the number of workers // <i>relatively </i>anyway; with respect to a definite measure of capital, e.g. per cent// whose labour is exploited at an increased rate.</p>
<p><span class="context">[...]</span> each one provided 1 hour of surplus labour a day. By the employment of machinery 6 workers should each provide 2 hours of surplus labour a day <span class="context">[...]</span> In this case 6 workers provide 12 hours of surplus labour, just as previously 12 did. The time during which the 12 workers [work] every day, assuming [a norm]al working day of 12 hours, [can] be regarded as a total working day of 144 hours, of which [132 hours are necessary labour] time, 12 surplus labour time. In the second case the total working day consists of 72 hours, of which 60 are necessary labour time, [12 surplus labour time]. Since a total working day of 72 hours now contains as much surplus labour as the day of 144 hours, in the latter case [6 workers] appear [to be use]less, superfluous for the production of 12 hours of surplus value. They are therefore suppressed by the employment of machinery.</p>
<p><span class="context">[...]</span> — which lies at the basis of all growth in relative surplus value — prolongation of surplus labour time through [curtailment of necessary] labour time; however, a process which was only employed previously in regard to the working day of the individual worker is now employed <span class="context">[...]</span> composed of the sum total of the working days of the workers simultaneously employed. The <i>retranchement</i> now takes <span class="context">[...]</span>. In the first case the sum total of hours of labour remains the same. It is merely their <i>division</i> between necessary and surplus labour, between <span class="context">[...]</span>, which is altered. But now there is a change not only in the <i>division</i> of labour time but also in the <i>sum total</i> of labour time employed.</p>
<p><span class="context">[...]</span> total working day of 144 hours e.g., which is no longer necessary,. since the employment of machinery, to [produce] 12 hours of surplus labour. <i>Superfluous, useless</i> labour is removed. From the capitalist standpoint all labour is useless, i.e. <i>unproductive</i>, which is not necessary <span class="context">[...]</span>, which would therefore be required for the <i>mere</i> reproduction of the worker himself. In the above example 72 <span class="context">[...]</span>, i.e. 6 days of labour. I.e. 6 of the 12 workers are dismissed. In the first case the magnitude remains <span class="context">[...]</span> (<span class="context">[...]</span> hours contained in it) the same. The division alone has changed. In the second case the magnitude changes — the total amount <span class="context">[...]</span> the division of the same. In the first case, therefore, the <i>value</i> remains the same, while <i>the surplus value increases</i>. In the second case <span class="context">[...]</span> at the same time the labour time objectified in the product, while the surplus [value] increases.</p>
<p><span class="context">[...]</span> of simple cooperation and division of labour [takes] place. This is as with <span class="context">[...]</span> Relatively to the product <span class="context">[...]</span> the number of workers is reduced <span class="context">[...]</span> workers <span class="context">[...]</span> capital<i> C </i><span class="context">[...]</span> constant <span class="context">[...]</span>, <span class="context">[XVI-997]</span> with machinery, an absolute reduction (with regard to a particular capital) takes place. In certain branches of industry, agriculture <span class="context">[...]</span> reduction is in fact always in advance, without being <strong>checked</strong> as in other branches of industry <strong>by the circumstance that at the new rate</strong> <span class="context">[...]</span> <strong>old number of labourers may be successively absorbed, but even an absolutely</strong> <strong>greater although relatively much smaller</strong> <span class="context">[...]</span></p>
<p>The way in which the rate of profit is altered even in the case considered above, where the rate of surplus value grows in the same (or [a greater proportion]) than the fall in the number of workers, hence the fall in one factor finds compensation in the growth of the other through more <span class="context">[...]</span> — hence the magnitude of the surplus value remains unchanged or even grows — depends on the proportion in which <span class="context">[...]</span> is [affected by] a <strong>change</strong> in the components of the total capital or on the proportion in which this <strong>change</strong> proceeds. <span class="context">[...]</span> The surplus value the capital makes <i>can only derive from the number of workers it exploits, or from the number of workers who</i> <span class="context">[...]</span> society — alias the class of capitalists as a whole — is affected by the setting free of the workers he has dismissed, <span class="context">[...]</span></p>
<p>It is now an entirely self-evident <i>general law</i> that with the progressive increase in the employment of machinery the magnitude <span class="context">[...]</span> remain, but must <i>fall</i>; i.e. that the reduction in the number of the <span class="context">[...]</span> (in relation to a particular measure of capital) <span class="context">[...]</span> <i>reduction</i> in the number cannot be continuously counterbalanced by a corresponding <i>increase in the rate of surplus value</i> the working day of the individual worker is exploited.</p>
<p>Assume that 50 workers provide only 2 hours of surplus [labour]; in that case the surplus value created by them = 100. Assume further <span class="context">[...]</span> if 10 men were replaced by 1, 5 would replace the 50. <span class="context">[...]</span> labour time = 5×12, = 72 a hours. The same for the <i>total value of their</i> product. The surplus [value] created by them [is] &lt; than 72, since only equal to 72 — the necessary labour time. Hence it is &lt; than 100 by much more. There therefore takes place so large that the reduction in the absolute amount of labour which is employed, brought about through the development of productive power, <span class="context">[...]</span> by an increase of equal size in the <i>rate of surplus value</i> — where surplus value therefore falls, despite the growth in the rate of surplus value. <span class="context">[...]</span> A <i>fall</i> in the amount of surplus value — or the total amount of surplus labour employed — must necessarily come about with the development of machinery <span class="context">[...]</span> it is [shown] here that capitalist production enters into contradiction with the development of the productive forces and is by no means their absolute <span class="context">[...]</span> and final form.</p>
<p>//If the 50 workers could all be employed at the new rate, or even only 25 perhaps, surplus value would grow, and not only its rate, as compared with the earlier <strong>case</strong>. Hence the importance of the scale on which machinery is employed, and its tendency to employ as many workers as possible at the same time, combined with the tendency to pay for as few necessary working days as possible.// (50) (150)</p>
<p><span class="greek">b</span>) Let us assume a capital of 600. Let 400 of this be laid out in labour, 200 in constant capital, instruments and raw material. Let the 400 represent 10 workers. If a machine were to be employed, which together with the raw material = 520, and if the capital laid out in labour were only to be 80 now, 10 workers would be replaced by 2 or 5 by 1. The total amount of capital laid out would remain the same, hence <i>production costs</i> would remain the same. The 2 workers would not produce more surplus labour time for each 12 hours than the 10 produced, for wages would have remained the same. Nevertheless, the quantities of commodities produced under the changed conditions of production might on certain presuppositions become cheaper, although it is presupposed that this quantity has not increased, or that no more commodities are produced with the same capital under the new process of production than were previously produced under the old one. Since the same quantity of raw material has been worked on as before, 150, the machinery has now risen from 50 to 370. // Namely 370 machinery, 150 raw material, 80 labour. 370 + 150 + 80 = 600. //</p>
<p>Assume now that the machinery employed has a turnover time //reproduction time// of 10 years. Of the value employed, 37 (370/10) would enter into the annual output of commodities for the replacement, <strong>wear and tear</strong>, of the machinery. The sum total of the production costs of the commodities //disregarding profit and surplus value here, as the rate remains the same// would now be = 37 + 150 + 80 = 267. The production cost of the commodity under the old process = 600, whereby we assume that the instruments which enter into the process (estimated at 50) must be renewed every year. The price of the commodities would have been cheapened in the ratio 267:600. To the extent that the commodity enters into the worker’s consumption, its cheapening would bring about a reduction in the labour necessary for his reproduction and thereby an increase in the length of surplus labour time. //But initially, as in any employment of machines, capitalist II would admittedly sell cheaper than capitalist I, but not in the same proportion as his production costs had fallen. This is in fact an anticipation of the cheapening of the production costs of labour which occurs through machinery <span class="context">[...]</span> [If] his workers receive the same wages as previously, they can admittedly buy more commodities (more of the commodities they themselves have produced) but not in the proportion in which they have become more productive. It would be the same thing if the capitalist paid them in his own commodity, as if he were to give them a quantity which was admittedly larger, but smaller in the proportion to which this quantity expressed exchange value.// Even if we disregard the relation itself, and consider the empirical form, in which the capitalist calculates interest, say 5%, on his total capital according to the part of it which has not been consumed. Then 5% on 300 (the part of the capital not consumed in the first year) = 15, or 5% profit e.g., similarly 15, therefore 30. Thus the price of the commodities would come to 280 + 30 = 310, still almost half as cheap as in the first case.</p>
<p>In fact only 370 thalers were laid out for fixed capital, 150 capital for raw material, and 80 for labour.</p>
<p>However, if in order to replace 5 workers by one the capital <span class="context">[...] </span>the machinery had to increase from 50 to perhaps 2,000 instead of 370, the total capital therefore rising to 2,300, the <strong>wear and tear </strong>contained in the commodity annually would = 2,000/100 = 20. Production costs would = 250, with interest and profit of 150. 250 + 150 + 80 = 480. 10% on <span class="context">[...]</span> So in this case by inequality <span class="context">[...]</span> 2,000 again = <span class="context">[...]</span><i> machinery </i>made dearer.</p>
<p><span class="context">[XVI-998]</span> <span class="context">[...]</span> in two ways:</p>
<p><span class="context">[...]</span> turnover time peculiar to fixed capital — mode of circulation — a much smaller aliquot part of it enters into the value <span class="context">[...]</span> product — than is really required for production. Only its <strong>wear</strong> and <strong>tear</strong>, the part of it that is worn out in the course of a year, enters into [the value of the pro]duct, because only this part really circulates. Hence if the capital remains the same and there is only a <strong>change</strong> in the proportion of the capital <span class="context">[...]</span> component of the capital laid out [in] labour, there is a cheapening of the product, the ultimate result of which is a cheapening <span class="context">[...]</span> in the production costs of labour, hence an increase in the rate of surplus value, i.e. of surplus labour time.</p>
<p>[If] capital [remains] <i>the same, </i>and there is also no increase in surplus time (or no original reduction in wages) <span class="context">[...]</span> measure, as the turnover time (reproduction time) of the fixed capital declines in velocity.</p>
<p><span class="context">[...]</span> the aliquot part of the old capital, which is converted into fixed capital, but the capital had rather to <span class="context">[...]</span> so that the total capital might grow, the proportion of this growth, required for the number of workers <span class="context">[...]</span> occur, in which the commodity produced with the machine became dearer than that produced with hand labour <span class="context">[...]</span></p>
<p><span class="context">[...]</span> posited on the assumption that the amount of commodities produced by the smaller number of workers is not larger, <span class="context">[...]</span> [than the] number produced without machinery, or on the assumption that <span class="context">[...]</span> capital with machinery does not <span class="context">[...]</span> than previously without it. <span class="context">[...]</span></p>
<p><span class="context">[...]</span> workers employed produced more than the 10 without it, they thus produce perhaps as much as 20 <span class="context">[...]</span> always a definite number, but perhaps a greater number than they force out. In this case 1 replaced <span class="context">[...]</span> could perhaps only be employed if both were employed. In any case, the part of capital laid out in <span class="context">[...]</span> would have to be <i>doubled. </i>I.e. the magnitude of the capital could not [remain] unaltered.</p>
<p><span class="context">[...]</span><i> </i>but if the slow turnover time of the capital cheapens the product, even if the old capital increases again, hence a greater amount of commodities than before is not produced, then this is even more so in the other case.</p>
<p>This belongs to <i>the section on production costs, </i>just as the previous comments on <i>surplus value </i>must be treated under the heading “Surplus Value”.</p>
<p>//The total amount of the capital advanced enters into the <i>labour process, </i>but only the part of the capital consumed during a particular period of the labour process enters into the <i>valorisation process </i>or into the <i>value of the product. </i>(See <i>Malthus. </i>) Hence the smaller value or the greater cheapness of the commodities which are e.g. produced with the same capital of 500, if 2/5 of this are fixed capital and 1/5 variable capital, than if the proportions are inverted. (Even if profit and interest are calculated on the whole of the capital, only an aliquot part of it enters into the value of the commodity, not the capital itself, as in the case in which the whole of the capital or the greatest part of it is laid out in living labour.) But the profit is calculated on the whole of the capital, including the unconsumed part of it. Although the unconsumed part of the capital does not enter into the value of the product of the individual capital considered for itself, it does enter into the average production costs of capitalist production, in the form of profit (interest), because it constitutes an element of the average profit, and an <strong>item</strong><i> </i>in the calculation by means of which the capitalists divide among themselves the total surplus value of the capital. //</p>
<p>// The rate of profit depends upon, or is nothing other than, the ratio of the surplus value (considered as an absolute magnitude) to the magnitude of the capital advanced. But the surplus value itself — i.e. its absolute magnitude — may fall even though the rate of surplus value rises, and rises considerably. The amount of surplus value or its absolute magnitude must indeed fall, despite any rise whatever in the rate of surplus value, once the <span class="context">[...]</span> of <i>surplus value </i>of the labour which is displaced by machinery is greater than the <i>total amount of value, </i>or labour, which steps into its place. Or the <i>surplus time </i>of the displaced worker[s] is greater than the <i>total labour time </i>of the workers who replace them. Thus if 50 are replaced by 5. And the surplus labour time of the 50 was 2 hours (with a normal working day of 12 hours). Their surplus labour time or the <i>surplus value </i>created by them = 100 hours. The total labour time or the <i>value </i>created [by the 5] (hence the necessary labour time + surplus) = 60 hours. Assume that these 5 workers provide twice as much surplus time, or that surplus value = 4 hours every day for each of them. So that for 5 there are 20 hours. The rate of surplus value has grown by 100%; the total amount of surplus value or the surplus value itself is only 4×5 = 20 hours. The surplus value is only 1/5 of the 100 created by the 50, smaller by 80%. If now 15 workers were employed at the new rate the amount of surplus value would rise to 60, if 20 to 80, if 25 to 100. Half as many workers would have to be employed at the new rate in order to produce as much surplus value as at the old rate. But if 50 were employed, they would produce twice as much, namely 200. Not only the rate of surplus value, but also the surplus value itself would have doubled.// //Assume that the 5 only produced surplus value at the same rate as the 50, hence only 10 hours. Then 50 workers would have to be employed just as before in order to produce the same surplus value, although they would produce 10 times as many commodities in the same time. This in the branches of industry where the product does not enter into the consumption of the workers themselves. Here the profit derives purely from the fact that the <i>necessary </i>labour time, over a certain average period, stands higher than the labour time needed by the capitalists who have introduced the new machinery; they therefore sell the commodity <i>above </i>its value. This is, however, different from sheer fraud. They sell it <i>above </i>the value it costs them, and <i>below </i>the value it costs society before the general introduction of the machinery. They sell the labour of their <span class="context">[...]</span> <i>higher </i>labour, they buy it as yet at <span class="context">[...]</span> With the <span class="context">[...]</span> at the new rate. But there is also an increase in c<span class="context">[...]</span> more significant <span class="context">[...]</span> </p>
<p><span class="context">[XVI-1009]</span><a id="XVI-1009"></a> //In the latter case he sells the individual commodity cheaper than it can be produced given the still <i>generally prevailing production costs, </i>he sells it <i>below </i>its average value, but not cheaper in the same proportion as he himself produces it below its average value. He sells the <i>total amount </i>of the commodities produced in an hour, in a day — //and with the new means of production he provides a greater total amount in the same time// — <i>above</i> their value, above the hour or the day of labour time contained in them. If he produces 20 yards with the same production costs as the others incur in producing 5, and if he sells them % below the average price, he is selling them 3/5 <i>above </i>their value. If the 10 yards cost 10x and he sells the 20 at 20 × 4x/5 = 80<i>x</i>/5<i> </i>= 16<i>x</i>, he is selling them at 6 over their value of 10. 1/5 of 10 is 2, or 3/6 of 10 is 5; 20 cost him 10; or 2 costs him 1 or 5/5. What now is the relation to his workers? If they continue to receive the same wages as before, they also receive commodities for their wages (i.e. in so far as the more cheaply produced commodity enters into their <span class="context">[XVI-1010]</span><a id="XVI-1010"></a> consumption). And let this take place for all the workers, each of whom would be able to buy more of this specific commodity with the aliquot part of their wage which is expended for it.</p>
<p>The capitalist would make a surplus profit of 3/5 or 60%. He sells them the commodity 1/5 cheaper, but he sells the labour contained in it 3/5 dearer than the average labour, hence at a value standing 3/5 above the average labour. 3/5 of 12 hours of labour = (12 × 3) / 5 = 36/5 = 7 1/15. This <i>surplus labour</i>, which they have provided for him through the higher potentiation of their labour, <strong>he pockets</strong>.</p>
<p>Let us assume that necessary labour time = 10. Thus under the old conditions they would obtain 10/12 of the product 10. In the old situation 1 hour of labour produces 1/12 of the product of a day, hence in 10, 10/12 = 8 thalers, for example. In the new situation 16/12 is produced in one hour of labour = 4/3, 1 1/3. In 3 hours 4 thalers, in 6 hours 8 thalers. Thus they work 6 hours of surplus labour. Previously it was only 2.//</p>
<p>//Adam Smith correctly adduces in favour of an average profit — i.e. a profit purely determined by the magnitude of the capital — the example of the use of silver instead of iron, or gold instead of silver, of a more costly raw material in general, under otherwise identical conditions of production. Here the part of the capital advanced in the form of raw material may grow hundredfold, and more, ditto therefore the profit, with the same rate of average profit. Although not the slightest <strong>change</strong> takes place in the organic relations between the different components of the capital. //</p>
<p>//The Yankee economist Wayland is very naïve. Because relative surplus value is only produced in branches of industry directly or indirectly involved in the production of articles destined for the workers’ consumption, hence it is there in particular that capital introduces cooperation, division of labour and machinery, and because this occurs to a much lesser extent in luxury production, he concludes that the capitalists work to the advantage of the poor, not the rich, and capital there develops its productivity in the interest of the former, not the latter. //</p>
<p>Average surplus value — disregarding here absolute surplus value, and considering only relative surplus value, which arises from the curtailment of necessary labour time through the development of the productive powers of labour — is the total amount of surplus value in all specific branches of production, measured against the total capital laid out for living labour. Since the development of productive power is very uneven in the different branches of industry (which directly or indirectly produce the means of subsistence entering into the worker’s consumption), uneven not only in degree but often proceeding in opposed directions, as the productivity of labour is just as much <span class="context">[XVI-1011]</span><a id="XVI-1011"></a> bound up with natural conditions which may lead to a decline in productivity while the productivity of labour grows // the whole of the investigation into the extent to which natural conditions influence the productivity of labour independently of the development of social productivity and often in opposition to it, belongs into the analysis of rent// — it results from this that this average surplus value must stand very much below the level to be expected from the development of productive power in the individual branches of industry (the most prominent ones). This is in turn one of the main reasons why the rate of surplus value, although it grows, does not grow in the same proportion as the variable capital declines in its proportion to the total capital. This would only be the case (assuming that the proportion is correct in general; it is correct for the rate of surplus value, as has been shown previously,’ but not for surplus value) if those branches of industry in which the variable<i> C </i>declines the most against fixed, etc., were to make their products enter into the consumption of the worker in the same proportion. But take here, for example, the proportion between industrial and agricultural products, where the relation is precisely the opposite.</p>
<p>Let us now consider a particular branch of industry. If an increase of productive power occurs in it, the increase which occurs in this particular branch absolutely does not imply a direct increase in the branch of industry which provides it with its raw material (with the exception of agriculture, since its product itself provides its raw material, in seeds, and this is again a peculiarity of agriculture). The raw material branch itself at first remains completely unaffected by the increase, and may also remain unaffected subsequently. //Nevertheless, a cheaper raw material does not step in to replace it, unless <i>the same raw material </i>becomes cheaper, as cotton does not replace sheep’s wool.// But the productivity is demonstrated by the fact that a greater quantity of raw material is needed to absorb the same quantity of labour. Thus this part of constant capital at first grows unconditionally with the greater productivity of labour. If 5 produce as much as 50, or more, 50 will work up 10 times more raw material. The raw material must initially increase in <i>the same </i>proportion as the productivity of labour. Or if we assume that 5 produce as much as 50, and 45 are dismissed, the 5 now need 10× as much capital as did the 5 previously, or as much as 50. This part of the capital has grown 10 times, at least, measured against the capital laid out in labour. //With greater exploitation this can be restricted somewhat, if on the one hand there is a relative reduction in waste through the improved quality of the labour, and on the other hand because the waste is absolutely more massive, more concentrated, can serve better as raw material once again for new, different production, hence in fact the same raw material stretches further, <strong>as to its value</strong><i>. </i>This is an <strong>item</strong><i>, </i>but an insignificant one.// However, this is not to say by any means that fixed capital, buildings, machinery (lighting, etc.) (apart from fixed capital the <i>matierès instrumentales </i>in general) increase in the same proportion, so that 10 times as much would now be required by the 5 as they required before. On the contrary. Although machinery of greater <strong>bulk</strong> becomes dearer absolutely, it becomes cheaper relatively. This is particularly true for the motive force, steam engines, etc., the production costs of which fall (relatively) with [the increase in] their horse power or other <strong>power</strong><i>. </i>This part — hence the <i>total constant capital — </i>therefore by no means grows in proportion with the growth in productive power, although it does grow <i>absolutely, </i>to an insignificant degree. The total capital therefore does not grow <span class="context">[XVI-1012]</span><a id="XVI-1012"></a> proportionally in relation to the growth of productive power.</p>
<p>If out of the 500 there were originally perhaps 300 for workers, 150 for raw material and 50 for instruments, it follows that a doubling of productive power through the application of machinery would require the employment of at least 300 for raw material, and if 50 workers’ produced this product of twice the size, 50 for labour; but it does not follow that the cost of machinery, etc., for these 30 workers would rise from 50 to 500, a tenfold increase. The cost of machinery would perhaps only rise to double the amount — to 100; so that the total capital would have fallen from 500 to 450. The ratio between the variable capital and the total capital would now be 30:450. 30/450 = 3/45 = 1/15. 1:15.</p>
<p>Previously the ratio was 300:500, 300/500 = 3:5. 1/15 = 3 /45; and 3/5 = 27/45. According to this, however, the total capital required to produce a certain surplus value would have fallen. Assume in the first case that the surplus value = 2 hours out of 12 = 2/12, in the second case = 4/12 or 1/3.</p>
<p>In the first case 1/6 of 300 (if a worker = 1 thaler) = 50. And this is 10% of 500.</p>
<p>In the second case 1/3 of 30 = 10. 450 are required for the production of these 10. If we assume that 300 workers are employed at this new rate, they would produce 100. The total capital needed to produce the 100 would rise to 450×30 = 4,500×3 = 13,500. In the previous ratio it was 1,000 to produce 100.</p>
<p>But assume that fixed capital falls still more, not perhaps relatively in proportion to the growth of the productive forces. If the 30 workers produce as much as the 300 did previously, they will need 500, just as before: 150 for raw material, 30 for labour (as previously 300), but perhaps only 100 for fixed capital. The total capital is now 210, of which variable capital is 3/21 = 1/7, <span class="context">[XVI-1013]</span><a id="XVI-1013"></a> previously = 3/5. (300 out of 500)</p>
<p>If the surplus value were now to increase 5fold, the 30 would give a surplus value of 50, where the 300 gave one of 10. Thus on 300, 30, would be on 30 — 15.</p>
<p>The total capital is 500 in the first case, 210 in the second case. 410 would now give 30, hence more than 500 previously.</p>
<hr class="section"/>
<p>The growth of productive power allows more commodities to be produced in the same labour time. Therefore, it does not raise the exchange value of the commodities produced in this way, but only their quantity; it rather lessens the exchange value of the individual commodities, while the value of the total amount of commodities produced in a given time remains <i>the same.</i></p>
<p>To say that there is an increase in productivity is the same as saying that the same raw material absorbs less labour in the course of its conversion into the product, or that the same labour time requires more raw material for its absorption.</p>
<p>For example, a pound of yarn requires exactly the same amount of cotton, whether a large or a small amount of labour is required for the conversion of the cotton into yarn. If the productivity of the spinner rises, the quantity of cotton contained in a pound of yarn absorbs less labour. The pound of yarn therefore falls in value, gets cheaper. If 20 times as many pounds of cotton as before are spun in an hour, e.g. 20 pounds instead of 1 pound, each pound of yarn falls by 1/20 in the value component the labour of spinning adds to it; in the differential value between a pound of cotton and a pound of yarn (leaving aside the value of the fixed capital present in the spun yarn). Nevertheless, the value of the product of the same time is now greater than before, not because more new value has been created, but only because more cotton has been spun, and the value of this has on our assumption remained the same. The newly created value would be the same amount for the 20 pounds as previously for the one pound alone. For 1 pound it would in the new mode of production be smaller by 1/20.</p>
<p>Presupposing therefore that the commodities are sold at their value, the increase of productive power (with the exceptions mentioned earlier) only creates surplus value in so far as the cheapening of the commodities cheapens the production costs of labour capacity, hence shortens the necessary labour time, hence lengthens surplus labour time.</p>
<p>The product of every particular sphere of production can therefore only create surplus value in so far as, and in the proportion in which, this <i>specific </i>product enters into the average consumption of the workers. But every such product — since a developed division of labour within society is a fundamental prerequisite for the development of commodities in general and even more for capitalist production — only forms an <i>aliquot </i>part of the worker’s total consumption. The increase of productive power in every particular sphere therefore creates a surplus value by <i>no means in proportion to the increase of productive power </i>but only in the much smaller proportion in which the product of this particular sphere forms an <i>aliquot </i>part of the worker’s total consumption. If a product formed 1/10 of the worker’s total consumption, a doubling of productive power would allow the production of 2/10 in the same time as ‘/to was produced previously. 1/10 of the wage would fall to 1/20, or by 50%, while the productive power would have risen by 100%. 50% on 1/10<i> x </i>= 5% on 1x. E.g. 5% on 100 comes to 105. 50% on 100/10 or 10 comes to 5, the same total amount. The growth of productive power by 100% would in this case have cheapened wages by 5%. <span class="context">[XVI-1014]</span><a id="XVI-1014"></a> It is therefore clear why the striking growth of productive power in individual branches of industry appears to be entirely out of proportion with the fall of wages or the growth of relative surplus value. Hence capital too — to the extent that this depends on surplus value, a point we shall soon investigate more closely — is far from increasing in the same proportion as the growth in the productive power of labour.</p>
<p>Only if productive power were to increase evenly in all branches of industry which directly or indirectly provide products for the worker’s consumption could the proportional growth of surplus value correspond to the proportional increase of productive power. But this is by no means the case. Productive power increases in very different proportions in these different branches. Contrary movements often take place in these different spheres (this is due partly to the anarchy of competition and the specific nature of bourgeois production, partly to the fact that the productive power of labour is also tied to natural conditions, which often become less productive in the same proportion as productivity rises, in so far as it depends on social conditions) so that the productivity of labour rises in one sphere while it falls in another. //Think for example of the simple influence of the seasons, on which the greater part of all the raw products of industry depends, exhaustion of forests, coal seams, mines and the like. // The growth of average total productivity is therefore always and unconditionally much less than this growth appears in a few particular spheres, and indeed in one of the main branches of industry, the products of which enter into the worker’s consumption, agriculture, it is as yet <strong>far from keeping pace with the development of the productive powers in the manufacturing industry</strong>. On the other hand, in many branches of industry the development of productive power has no influence, either directly or indirectly, on the production of labour capacity, hence of relative surplus value. Quite apart from the fact that the development of productive power is not only expressed in an increase in the rate of surplus value but also in a (relative) reduction in the number of workers.</p>
<p>Hence the growth of surplus value is by no means in proportion to the growth of productive power in particular branches of production, and, secondly, it is also always smaller than the growth of the productive power of capital in all branches of industry (hence also those branches whose products enter neither directly nor indirectly into the production of labour capacity). Hence the accumulation of capital grows — not in the same proportion as productive power increases in a particular branch, and not even in the proportion in which productive power increases in all branches, but only in the average proportion in which it increases in <i>all </i>the branches of industry of which the products enter directly or indirectly into the overall consumption of the workers.</p>
<hr class="section"/>
<p>The <i>value </i>of a <i>commodity is </i>determined by the total labour time, <i>past </i>and <i>living, </i>which enters into it, which is contained in it; hence not only by the labour time which is added in the final production process, from which the commodity as such emerges, but by the labour contained in the fixed capital and circulating capital, or in the conditions of production of the labour last to be added, by the labour time contained in the machinery, etc., the <i>matières instrumentales </i>and the raw material, in so far as their value reappears in the commodity, which is entirely the case with raw material and <span class="context">[XVI-1015]</span><a id="XVI-1015"></a> the <i>matières instrumentales, </i>whereas the value of the fixed capital only reappears partially in the product — in proportion to its <strong>wear and tear</strong>.</p>
<p>If 1/4 of the value in a commodity consisted of constant capital and 3/<i>4 of</i> wages; if as a result of an increase of productive power in this particular branch the amount of living labour employed were to fall from <i>3/4 </i>to <i>1/4, </i>and if the number of workers employed in its production were to be reduced from 3/4 to 1/4, then, given the presupposition that the 1/4 of labour was exactly as productive as the 3/4 was previously (and not more so), the value of the new fixed and circulating capital, apart from the raw material contained in the 1/4, could rise to 2/4. Then the value of the commodity would remain unchanged, although the labour would have become more productive by 3/4 to 1/4, i.e. by 3 to 1, i.e. it would have tripled its productive power. Since the value of the raw material would have remained the same, the new fixed and circulating capital would not be able to rise as far as 2/4 of the old value of the commodity, thus permitting the commodity to become cheaper, with a real fall in its production costs. Or the difference between the new labour time and the old would have to be larger than the difference between the value of the old constant capital and the new (deducting the raw material). It is not possible to add the same amount more of past labour as a condition of labour as has been deducted of living labour. If the 1/4 of workers were to produce <i>more </i>than the 3/4 did previously, so that the increase in the productivity of their labour were greater than the reduction in their numbers or their total labour time, the new constant capital could grow //disregarding surplus value here and speaking only of the value of the commodity, on which after all the surplus value depends, because the cheapening of the production costs of labour capacity depends on the lessening of the value// by 2/4, and even by more than 2/4, only it would now have to grow in the same proportion as the productive power of the new labour.</p>
<p>Secondly, however, this relation is also brought about, 1) by the fact that the fixed capital only enters in part into the value of the commodity; 2) the <i>matières instrumentales, </i>such as the coal consumed, the heating, lighting, etc., are proportionally economised by labour on a large scale, although their total value increases, and therefore a smaller value component of the same enters into the individual commodity. But the condition remains the same, that the value component of the machinery which enters into the individual commodity as <strong>wear</strong> and <strong>tear</strong>, and the <i>matières instrumentales </i>which enter into it, should be smaller than the difference in productivity between the new and the old labour. Nevertheless, this does not exclude the possibility that an equally large or even a larger quantity of constant capital might be used for the total amount of commodities, e.g. the number of pounds of twist, which are produced in a given period of time, e.g. a day, than was previously expended in the form of wages. Only a smaller quantity in respect of the individual commodity. Presupposing, therefore, that the 1/4 <i>n</i> workers produce exactly as much in one day as the 3/4 <i>n</i> workers produced previously, the law would remain absolute. Because the amount of commodities produced would remain the same in proportion to these 1/4 <i>n</i> workers as it was for the 3/4 <i>n</i> workers. The value of the individual commodity could therefore fall <i>only </i>if the new constant capital &lt; than that previously expended in wages and now no longer in existence. It can therefore be said absolutely that in the proportion in which <i>a smaller quantity of labour replaces a greater quantity of labour</i> — <span class="context">[XVI-1016]</span><a id="XVI-1016"></a> does not need to be identical, but may be, and mostly is, greater than the proportion in which the number of workers is diminished (the relative number of workers) — the constant capital which enters into the commodity //and in practice also the interest and profit on the <i>whole of </i>the constant capital, which admittedly enters into the labour process but not into the valorisation process// must be greater than the proportion in which the new constant capital grows (here the raw material is left out). This is only an aspect to be introduced in distinction to the one-sided consideration in dealing with surplus value. To be inserted in the section on production costs.</p>
<p>This does not, however, (owing to the way in which the fixed capital is reproduced) prevent the total capital //hence also the part of it which is not <i>consumed </i>in the labour process, but still enters into it// from being absolutely greater than the previous total capital.</p>
<p>Thus if e.g. 1 replaces 10, the capital which is allotted to him in the form of machinery, etc., and <i>matières instrumentales — </i>in so far as it enters into his product — is smaller than the previous capital which was required for the 10 workers. The proportion of capital laid out in labour has fallen 10 times here, but the new constant capital has perhaps only risen 8 times. From this point of view, therefore, the capital laid out in labour has not fallen proportionally in the same degree as the capital required for its realisation [has increased]. Or the total amount of capital which enters into the production of the one worker is smaller than the total amount of capital which enters into the production of the 10 workers replaced by him. And, although the part of capital laid out in wages has fallen 10 times in comparison with previously, it still forms a larger part of this new capital than 1/10, because this new capital, which enters into the production of the one worker, has itself become <i>smaller </i>than the old capital, which entered into the production of the 20 workers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, however, the total capital which is required as condition of production for this increase in the productivity of labour — including namely the part which does not enter as <strong>wear</strong> and <strong>tear</strong> into the product — but is rather consumed in a series of work periods — is greater — may be much greater than the previous total capital, so that the part of the total capital laid out in labour has declined in a still greater proportion than the productivity of labour has grown. The more the fixed capital develops, i.e. the productivity of labour, the greater this unconsumed part of the capital, the smaller the proportion of the part of capital laid out in labour in relation to the total capital. From this point of view it might appear as if the magnitude of the capital grew more rapidly than the productivity of labour //but even the total capital cannot grow to the extent that the interest and profit on it raise the production costs of the commodity to the level to which the productivity of labour has risen//. But this only means that the portion of the capital annually produced which is converted into fixed capital is always increased relatively to the portion of the capital which is laid out in wages; by no means, however, that the total capital — which is in part fixed, in part converted into wages — grows as quickly as the productivity of labour.</p>
<p>If the part of capital laid out in labour thus falls, this is even more the case if the growth in the part of capital which consists of raw material is brought into <i>consideration </i>at the same time.</p>
<p><span class="context">[XVI-1017]</span><a id="XVI-1017"></a> Let us take an extreme case: the rearing of sheep on a modern scale, where previously small-scale agriculture predominated. But here <i>two different branches of industry </i>are being compared. The amount of labour — or of capital laid out in wages — which is suppressed here is enormous. Hence the constant capital can also grow enormously. And it is very much the question whether the total capital which is here allotted to the individual shepherds is greater than the total amount of the capitals which were previously divided among several hundred shepherds.</p>
<p>It is questionable whether, in individual branches of industry in which the total capital undergoes extraordinary growth, profit originates at all from the surplus value produced in these branches and not rather, in connection with the calculations made by the capitalists between themselves, from the general surplus value produced by the sum total of all the capitals.</p>

<p>Many ways of increasing productive power, particularly with the employment of machinery, require absolutely no relative increase in capital outlay. Often only relatively inexpensive alterations in the part of the machine which provides the motive force, etc. See examples. Here the increase in productive power is unusually great compared to the capital outlay which falls to the relative share of the individual worker — of the individual commodity as well. Thus here — at least as far as this part of the capital is concerned — the capital laid out in raw material grows the more rapidly — no noticeable reduction in the rate of profit — at least not to the extent that it would be caused by an increase in this part of the capital. On the other hand, although the capital does not grow here so much relatively speaking, it is true to say, as it is in the general case overall, that for the most part the absolute amount of capital employed — hence the concentration of capital or the scale on which work is done — must grow very significantly. More powerful steam engines (of more horsepower) are absolutely dearer than less powerful ones. But relatively speaking their price falls. Even so, a greater outlay of capital — a greater concentration of capital in one hand — is required for their employment. A bigger factory building is absolutely dearer, but relatively cheaper, than a smaller one. If every aliquot part of the total capital is smaller in proportion to the total capital employed by the labour saved, this aliquot part can mostly be employed solely in such <strong>multiples</strong> as will raise the total amount of capital employed to an extraordinary degree or in particular the part of the total capital not consumed in a single turnover, the part the consumption of which extends over a period of turnovers lasting many years. It is in general only with this work on a large scale that productive power is increased tremendously, since it is only in this way that:</p>
<p>1) the principle of <strong>multiples</strong>, <i>which underlies </i>simple cooperation, and is repeated in the division of labour and the employment of machinery, can correctly be applied. (See <i>Babbage, </i>on how this increases the scale of production, i.e. the concentration of capital.)</p>
<p>2) The greater altogether the number of workers employed on the new scale, the smaller, relatively, the portion of fixed capital which enters as <strong>wear</strong> and <strong>tear</strong> for buildings, etc. The greater the principle of the cheapening of production costs by joint utilisation of the same use values, as lighting, heating, common use of the motive power, etc. <span class="context">[XVI-1018]</span><a id="XVI-1018"></a> The more is it possible to employ absolutely dearer, but relatively cheaper, instruments of production.</p>
<hr class="section"/>
<p>The circumstance that in some branches of production, railways, canals, etc., where an immense fixed capital is employed, these are not independent sources of surplus value, because the ratio between the labour exploited and the capital laid out is too small.</p>
<hr class="section"/>
<p>A further remark needs to be added to the previous page:</p>
<p>It is possible that if a capital of 500 was needed for 20 workers, and now a total capital of only 400 is needed for 2, 2,000 workers will now have to be employed, hence a capital of 400,000, in order to employ the aliquot parts of the 400 productively. It has already been shown’ that even with an increased rate of surplus value the relative reduction in the number of workers to be exploited can only be counterbalanced by a very great increase in the multiple of labour.</p>
<p>This is seen (appears) in competition. Once the new invention has been introduced generally, the rate of profit becomes too small for a small capital to be able to continue to operate in the given branch of industry. The amount of necessary conditions of production grows in general in such a way that a significant minimum level comes into existence, which excludes all the smaller capitals from this branch of production for the future. It is only at the beginning that small capitals can exploit mechanical inventions in every sphere of production.</p>
<hr class="section"/>
<p>The growth of capital only implies a reduction in the rate of profit to the extent that with the growth of capital the above-mentioned changes take place in the ratio between its organic components. However, despite the constant daily changes in the mode of production, capital, or a large part of it, always continues to accumulate over a longer or shorter period on the basis of a definite average ratio between those organic components, so that <strong>no organic change</strong> occurs <strong>in its constituent parts</strong> as it grows.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a reduction in the rate of profit can only be enforced by a growth in capital — because of a growth in the absolute amount of profit — as long as the rate of profit does not fall in the same proportion as the capital grows. The obstacles which stand in the way of this are to be found in the considerations we have already brought forward. </p>

<p>Absolute plethora of capital.</p>
<hr class="section"/>
<p>Increase in workers, etc., despite the relative decline in variable capital or capital laid out in wages. However, this does not take place in all spheres of production <span class="context">[XVI-1019]</span><a id="XVI-1019"></a>. E.g. not in agriculture. Here the decline in the element of living labour is absolute.</p>
<p>An increase in the amount of labour on the new production basis is in part necessary in order to compensate for the lessened rate of profit by means of the amount of profit; in part in order to compensate for the fall in the magnitude of surplus value which accompanies the rising rate of surplus value on account of the absolute reduction in the number of workers exploited by means of an increase in the number of workers on the new scale. Finally the principle of <strong>multiples</strong> touched on earlier,</p>
<hr class="section"/>
<p>But it will be said that if the variable capital declines in sphere of production I, it increases in the others, namely those which are employed in the production of the constant capital needed for sphere of production I. Nevertheless, the same relation enters here, e.g. in the production of machinery, in the production of raw products, <i>matières instrumentales, </i>e.g. coal. The tendency is general, although it is first realised in the different spheres of production by fits and starts. It is counterbalanced by the fact that the spheres of production themselves increase. In any case, it is only a need of the bourgeois economy that the number of people living from their labour alone should increase absolutely, even if it declines relatively. Since labour capacities become superfluous for the bourgeois economy once it is no longer necessary to exploit them for 12 to 15 hours a day. A development of productive power which reduced the absolute number of workers, i.e. in fact enabled the whole nation to execute its total production in a smaller period of time, would bring about revolution, because it would demonetise the majority of the population. Here there appears once again the limit of bourgeois production, and the fact becomes obvious that it is not the absolute form for the development of productive power, that it rather enters into collision with the latter at a certain point. In part this collision appears constantly, with the crises, etc., which occur when now one now another component of the working class becomes superfluous in its old mode of employment. Its limit is the surplus time of the workers; it is <i>not concerned </i>with the absolute surplus time gained by society. <i>The development of productive power </i>is therefore only important in so far as it increases the surplus labour time of the workers, not in so far as it reduces labour time for material production in general. It is therefore embedded in a contradiction.</p>
<hr class="section"/>
<p>The rate of surplus value — i.e. the ratio of surplus to necessary labour time for the individual worker (therefore in so far as surplus value is not modified in the different spheres of production by the proportion between the organic components of capital, turnover time, etc.) — is automatically balanced out in all the spheres of production, and this is <i>a basis for the general rate of profit. </i>(The modifications which in this way influence the necessary costs of production are compensated for by the competition between capitalists, by the different <strong>items</strong> which they bring into consideration when dividing among themselves the general surplus value.)</p>
<p><span class="context">[XVI-1020]</span><a id="XVI-1020"></a> That the rate of surplus value rises means nothing other than that the cost of production of labour capacity falls, hence necessary labour time falls, in the proportion to which the <i>specific </i>product of that particular sphere of production which has become cheaper enters into the general consumption of the workers. This cheapening of labour capacity, reduction in necessary labour time, increase in absolute labour time, therefore takes place uniformly, and influences all spheres of capitalist production uniformly, not only those in which the development of productive power has taken place, but also those whose products do not enter at all into the consumption of the workers, and in which the development of productive power can therefore create no relative surplus value. (It is therefore clear that in competition, once the monopoly in the new invention has come to an end, the price of the product is reduced to its production costs.)</p>
<p>If, therefore, 20 workers who work 2 hours of surplus labour are replaced by 2, it is correct, as we have seen already, that these 2 can under no circumstances provide as much surplus labour as the 20 did previously. But in all spheres of production the surplus labour rises in proportion to the cheapening of the product of the 2 workers, and it rises without any alteration having taken place in the ratio of the organic components of the capitals employed by the spheres of production.</p>
<p>On the other hand, an increase in the value of the product of a sphere of production of this kind, which enters into the reproduction of labour capacity, has just as general an effect; this may wholly or partially paralyse that surplus value.</p>
<p>In the first case, however, the surplus labour time gained is not to be estimated by the sphere of production in which the increase of productive power has taken place, but by the sum total of the diminutions of necessary labour time in <i>all </i>spheres of capitalist production.</p>
<p>But the more general the relation becomes, with 2 replacing 20 in all or most spheres of production, under the same proportions between total capital and variable capital, the more does the relation in the totality of capitalist production raise the relation in the particular spheres of production. I.e. no reduction in necessary labour time could create the amount of surplus value there was previously, when 20 worked instead of 2.</p>
<hr class="section"/>
<p>And under all circumstances the rate of profit would then fall, even if the capital itself increased so much that a number [of workers] equally great or even greater than before could be employed under the new conditions of production.</p>
<hr class="section"/>
<p>The <i>accumulation </i>of capital (considered materially) is double. It consists on the one hand in the <i>growing amount </i>of past labour, or the available amount of the conditions of labour; the material prerequisites, the already available products and numbers of workers, under which new production or reproduction takes place. Secondly, however, in the <i>concentration, </i>the reduction in the number of capitals, the growth of the capitals present in the hands of the individual capitalist, in short in a new distribution of capitals, of social capital. The power of capital as such grows thereby. The independent position achieved by the social conditions of production <span class="context">[XVI-1021]</span><a id="XVI-1021"></a> vis-à-vis the real creators of those conditions of production, as represented in the capitalist, thereby becomes increasingly apparent. Capital shows itself more and more as a <i>social power </i>(the capitalist is merely its functionary, and it no longer stands in any relation to what the labour of an individual creates or can create), but an <i>alienated social power which has become independent, </i>and confronts society as a thing — and through this thing as a power of the individual capitalist. On the other hand, constantly increasing masses [of people] are thereby deprived of the conditions of production and find them set over against them. The contradiction between the <i>general social power </i>which capital is formed into, and the <i>private Power of the individual capitalist </i>over these social conditions of production becomes ever more glaring, and implies the dissolution of this relation, since it implies at the same time the development of the material conditions of production into general, therefore communal social conditions of production.</p>
<p>This development is given by the development of productive power along with capitalist production and by the manner in which this development of productive, power takes shape.</p>
<p>The question now is, how is the accumulation of capital affected by the development of the productive forces, in so far as they find expression in <strong>change</strong>[<strong>s</strong>] in surplus value and the rate of profit, and how far is it influenced by other factors?</p>
<p>Ricardo says that capital can grow in two ways: 1) in that a greater amount of labour is contained in the greater amount of products, hence the exchange value of the use values grows along with their quantity; 2) in that the quantity of use values grows, but not their exchange value, hence the increase occurs simply through an increase in the productivity of labour.</p>

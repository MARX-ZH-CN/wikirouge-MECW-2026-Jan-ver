<h4>London, December 10, 1861</h4>
<p>The United States has evidently entered a critical stage with regard
to the <i>slavery question</i>, the question underlying the whole Civil War.
General Fremont has been dismissed for declaring the slaves of <i>rebels</i>
free. A directive to General Sherman, the commander of the expedition to
South Carolina, was a little later published by the Washington
Government, which goes further than Fremont, for it decrees that
fugitive slaves even of <i>loyal</i> slave-owners should be welcomed and
employed as workers and paid a wage, and under certain circumstances
armed, and consoles the "loyal" owners with the prospect of receiving
compensation later. Colonel Cochrane has gone even further than
Fremont, he demands the arming of all slaves as a military measure. The
Secretary of War Cameron publicly approves of Cochrane's "views".
The Secretary of the Interior, on behalf of the government, then
repudiates the Secretary of War. The Secretary of War expresses his
"views" even more emphatically at a public meeting stating that he will
vindicate  these  views in his report to Congress. General Halleck,
Fremont's successor in Missouri, and General Dix in east Virginia have
driven fugitive Negroes from their military camps and forbidden them
to appear in future in the vicinity of the positions held by their armies.
General Wool at the same time has received the black "contraband"
with open arms at Fort Monroe. The old leaders of the <i>Democratic</i>
Party, Senator Dickinson and Croswell (a former member of the so-
called Democratic regency), have published an open letter in which
they express their agreement with Cochrane and Cameron, and Colonel
<i>Jennison</i> in Kansas has surpassed all his military predecessors by an
address to his troops which contains the following passage:</p>
<p class="quote">
No temporising with rebels and those sympathising with them. I have told
General Fremont that I would not have drawn my sword had I thought that
slavery would outlast this struggle. The slaves of rebels will always find
protection
in this camp and we will defend them to the last man and the last bullet. I
want
no men who are <i>not Abolitionists</i>, I have no use for them and I
hope that there
are no such people among us, for everyone knows that slavery is the basis, the
centre and the vertex of this infernal war. Should the government
disapprove of
my action it can take back my patent, but in that case I shall act on my
own hook
even if in the beginning I can only count on six men.
</p>
<p>The slavery question is being solved in practice in the border slave
states even now, especially in <i>Missouri</i> and to a lesser extent in
Kentucky, etc. A large-scale dispersal of slaves is taking place. For
instance 50,000 slaves have disappeared from Missouri, some of them
have run away, others have been transported by the slave-owners to the
more distant southern states.</p>
<p>It is rather strange that a most important and significant event is not
mentioned in any English newspaper. On November 18, delegates from
45 North Carolina counties met on Hatteras Island, appointed a provisional
government, revoked the Ordinance of Secession and proclaimed
that North Carolina was returning to the Union. The counties of North
Carolina represented at this convention have been called together to
elect their Representatives to Congress at Washington.</p>

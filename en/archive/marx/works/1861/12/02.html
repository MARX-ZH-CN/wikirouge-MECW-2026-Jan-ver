<h4>London, November 28, 1861</h4>
<p>	The conflict of the English mail ship <i>Trent</i> with the North
American warship <i>San Jacinto</i> in the narrow passage of the Old
Bahama Channel is the lion among the events of the day. In the afternoon of
November 27 the mail ship <i>La Plata</i> brought the news of the
incident to Southampton, where the electric telegraph at once flashed it to
all parts of Great Britain. The same evening the London Stock Exchange was
the stage of stormy scenes similar to those at the time of the announcement
of the Italian war. Quotations for government stock sank three-quarters to
one per cent. The wildest rumours circulated in London. The American
Ambassador, Adams, was said to have been given his passport, an embargo to
have been imposed on all American ships in the Thames, etc. At the same
time a protest meeting of merchants was held at the Stock Exchange in
Liverpool, to demand measures from the British Government for the
satisfaction of the violated honour of the British flag. Every sound-minded
Englishman went to bed with the conviction that he would go to sleep in a
state of peace but wake up in a state of war.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the fact is well-nigh categorically established that the
conflict between the <i>Trent</i> and the <i>San Jacinto</i> brings no
war in its train. The semi-official press, like <i>The Times</i> and
<i>The Morning Post</i>, strikes a peaceful note and pours juridically
cool deductions on the flickerings of passion. Papers like the <i>Daily
Telegraph</i>, which at the faintest <i>mot d'ordre</i> roar for the
British lion, are true models of moderation. Only the Tory opposition
press, <i>The Morning Herald</i> and <i>The Standard</i>, hits out.
These facts force every expert to conclude that the ministry has already
decided not to make a <i>casus belli</i> out of the untoward event.</p>
<p>
It must be added that the event, if not the details of its enactment, was
anticipated. On October 12, Messrs. Slidell, Confederacy emissary to
France, and Mason, Confederacy emissary to England, together with their
secretaries Eustis and MacFarland, had run the blockade of Charleston on
the steamship Theodora and sailed for Havana, there to seek the opportunity
of a passage under the British flag. In England their arrival was expected
daily. North American warships had set out from Liverpool to intercept the
gentlemen, with their dispatches, on this side of the Atlantic Ocean. The
British ministry had already submitted the question whether the North
Americans were entitled to take such a step to its official jurisconsults
for their opinion. Their answer is said to have been in the affirmative.</p>
<p>The legal question turns in a narrow circle. Since the foundation of the
United States, North America has adopted <i>British</i> maritime law in
all its rigour. A major principle of this maritime law is that all
<i>neutral merchantmen</i> are subject to search by the belligerent
parties.</p>
<p class="quote">
"This right, " said Lord Stowell in a judgment which has become famous,
"offers the sole security that no contraband is carried on neutral ships."
</p>
<p>The greatest American authority,<i> Kent</i>, states in the same
sense:</p>
<p class="quote">

"The right of self-preservation gives belligerent nations this right. The
doctrine of the British admiralty on the right of visitation and search ...
has been recognised in its fullest extent by the courts of justice in our
country."
</p>
<p>It was not opposition to the right of search, as is sometimes
erroneously suggested, that brought about the Anglo-American War of 1812 to
1814. Rather, America declared war because England <i>unlawfully</i>
presumed to search even American <i>warships</i>, on the pretext of
catching deserters from the British Navy.</p>
<p>The <i>San Jacinto,</i> therefore, had the right to search the
<i>Trent</i> and to confiscate any contraband stowed aboard her. That
<i>dispatches</i> in the possession of Mason, Slidell and Co. come under
the category of contraband even <i>The Times, The Morning Post</i>, etc.,
admit. There remains the question whether Messrs. Mason, Slidell and Co.
were themselves contraband and might consequently be confiscated! The point
is a ticklish one and differences of opinion prevail among the doctors of
law. <i>Pratt,</i> the most distinguished British authority on
"Contraband", in the section on <i>"Quasi-Contraband,  Dispatches,
Passengers"</i> specifically refers to "communication of information and
orders from a belligerent government to its officers abroad, or the
conveyance of military passengers". Messrs. Mason and Slidell, if not
officers, were just as little ambassadors, since their governments are
recognised neither by Britain nor by France. What are they, then? In
justification of the very broad conceptions of contraband asserted by
Britain in the Anglo-French wars, Jefferson already remarks in his memoirs
that contraband, by its nature, precludes any exhaustive definition and
necessarily leaves great scope for arbitrariness. In any event, however,
one sees that from the standpoint of English law the <i>legal
question</i> dwindles to a Duns Scotus controversy, the explosive force of
which will not go beyond exchange of diplomatic notes.</p>
<p>The  <i>political</i> aspect of the North American procedure was
estimated quite correctly by <i>The Times</i> in these words:</p>
<p class="quote">

"Even Mr. Seward himself must know that the voices of the Southern
commissioners, sounding from their captivity, are a thousand times more
eloquent in London and in Paris than they would have been if they had been
heard in St. James's and the Tuileries."
</p>
<p>And is not the Confederacy already represented in London by Messrs.
Yancey and Mann?</p>
<p>We regard this latest operation of Mr. Seward as a characteristic act of
tactlessnesses by self-conscious weakness simulating strength. If the naval
incident hastens Seward's removal from the Washington Cabinet, the United
States will have no reason to record it as an "untoward event" in the
annals of its Civil War.</p>

<h4>London, Dec. 13, 1861</h4>
<p>
The news of the <i>Harvey Birch's</i> fate and the presence of the cruiser
Nashville in Southampton harbour reached New York on November
29, but does not seem to have caused the sensational effect on which
certain circles here counted just as much as others, the anti-war groups,
feared it. On this occasion the force of one shock wave was broken by
that of another. For New York was just in the throes of an election
campaign, since voting for a new mayor was to take place on December
3. Mr. Russell, the envoy of <i>The Times</i> in Washington, who ruins his
Celtic talent by affected Englishness, pretends supercilious surprise at
this pre-election commotion. Mr. Russell of course plays up to the
illusions of the London cockney, who imagines that the election of a
New York mayor is just as much a display of antiquated tomfoolery as
is the election of a Lord Mayor in London. It is well known that the
Lord Mayor of London is not concerned at all with the greater part of
London. He is nominally the regent of the City, a mythological
phenomenon which attempts to prove that it really exists by producing
good turtle soup at banquets and bad judgments in cases of infringement of
police regulations. Only in the fancy of Parisian writers of
vaudevilles and of news items for the press does the Lord Mayor of
London still remain an important political personage. The Mayor of
New York on the other hand is a real power. At the beginning of the
secession movement, the notorious <i>Fernando Wood,</i> the previous
Mayor, was about to declare New York an independent city republic,
of course in agreement with Jefferson Davis. His plan was thwarted by
the energy of the Republican Party of the Empire City.</p>
<p>Charles Sumner from Massachusetts, a member of the Senate -- where
he was attacked by a cane-wielding Senator from the South at the time
of the Kansas affair -- made a brilliant speech on the origin and hidden
motives of the slave-owners' rebellion at a well-attended meeting in the
Cooper Institute of New York on November 27. After his address the
meeting passed the following resolution:</p>
<p class="quote">
The doctrine of the emancipation of the slaves of rebels advanced by General
Fremont, as well as pronouncements subsequently made by General Burnside,
Senator Wilson, George Bancroft (the famous historian), Colonel Cochrane and
Simon Cameron, which point to the anticipated eradication of slavery as the
cause of the rebellion, express a moral, political and military necessity.
This meeting considers that public opinion in the North is now definitely
prepared to support any practical plan for the eradication of slavery --
this national misfortune -- that might be proposed, and it regards such a
result as the only consistent conclusion of this fight between civilisation
and barbarism.
</p>
<p>The <i>New-York Tribune</i> makes the following remark about Sumner's  speech:</p>
<p class="quote">
"The allusion of Mr. Sumner to the coming discussions of Congress on this
subject" (slavery), "will kindle a hope that that body will understand where
Southern weakness and Northern strength really lie, and will seize the
instrumentality by which the rebellion is to be brought to a speedy and
final extirpation."
</p>
<p>A personal letter from <i>Mexico</i> contains inter alia the following
passage:</p>
<p class="quote">
"The British ambassador plays the part of an enthusiastic friend of President
Juárez's Administration.... People well versed in Spanish intrigues
assert that
General Marquez has been instructed by Spain to rally the scattered forces,
both
the Mexican and the Spanish elements, of the Church party. This party is then
supposed to use an opportunity, which is expected to present itself soon,
to beg
Her Catholic Majesty to provide a king for the throne of Mexico. An uncle
of the
Queen is said to have been chosen for this office. Since the man is old he
would in
the natural course of events soon quit the scene, and as any clause
designating a
successor was to be avoided, Mexico would revert to Spain. Thus the same
policy
would carry the day in Mexico as in Haiti."

<h4>London, November 29, 1861</h4>
<p>The law officers of the Crown had yesterday to give their opinion on the
naval incident in the Bahama Channel. Their records of the case consisted
of the written reports of the British officers who have remained on board
the <i>Trent</i> and of the oral testimony of Commodore Williams, who was
on board the <i>Trent</i> as Admiralty agent, but disembarked from the
<i>La Plata</i> on November 27 at Southampton, whence he was immediately
summoned by telegraph to London. The law officers of the Crown acknowledged
the right of the <i>San Jacinto</i> to visit and search the
<i>Trent</i>. Since Queen Victoria's proclamation of neutrality on the
outbreak of the American Civil War expressly lists <i>dispatches</i>
among articles of contraband, there could be no doubt on this point either.
There remained, then, the question whether Messrs. Mason, Slidell and Co.
were themselves contraband and therefore confiscable. The law officers of
the Crown appear to hold this view, for they have dropped the
<i>material</i> legal question entirely. According to the report of
<i>The Times</i>, their opinion blames the commander of the <i>San
Jacinto</i> only for an <i>error in procedure</i>. Instead of Messrs.
Mason, Slidell and Co., he should have taken the <i>Trent</i> herself in
tow as a prize, brought her to the nearest American port and there
submitted her to the judgment of a North American prize court. This is
incontestably the procedure corresponding to British and therefore to North
American maritime law.</p>
<p>It is equally incontestable that the British frequently violated this
rule during the anti-Jacobin war and proceeded in the summary fashion of
the <i>San Jacinto</i>. However that may be, the whole conflict is
reduced by this opinion of the law officers of the Crown to a <i>technical
error</i> and consequently deprived of any immediate import. Two
circumstances make it easy for the Union government to accept this point of
view and therefore to afford formal satisfaction. In the first place,
Captain Wilkes, the commander of the <i>San Jacinto</i>, could have
received no direct instructions from Washington. On the voyage home from
Africa to New York, he called on November 2 at Havana, which he left again
on November 4, whilst his encounter with the <i>Trent</i> took place on
the high seas on November 8. Captain Wilkes's stay of only two days in
Havana did not permit any exchange of notes between him and his government.
The consul of the Union was the only American authority with whom he could
deal. In the second place, however, he had obviously lost his head, as his
failure to insist on the surrender of the dispatches proves.</p>
<p>The importance of the incident lies in its moral effect on the English
people and in the political capital that can easily be made out of it by
the British cotton friends of secession. Characteristic of the latter is
the Liverpool protest meeting organised by them and previously mentioned by
me. The meeting took place on November 27 at three in the afternoon, in the
cotton auction-rooms of the Liverpool Exchange, an hour after the alarming
telegram from Southampton had arrived.</p>
<p>After vain attempts to press the chairmanship on Mr. Cunard, the owner
of the Cunard steamships plying between Liverpool and New York, and other
high trade officials, a young merchant named Spence, notorious for a work
he wrote in support of the slave republic, took the chair. Contrary to the
rules of English meetings, he, the chairman, himself proposed the motion to
call on "the government to preserve the dignity of the British flag by
demanding prompt satisfaction for this affront." Tremendous applause,
clapping and cheers upon cheers! The main argument of the opening speaker
for the slave republic was that slave ships had hitherto been protected by
the American flag from the right of search claimed by Britain. And then
this philanthropist launched a furious attack on the slave trade! He
admitted that England had brought about the war of 1812-14 with the United
States by insisting on searching for deserters from the British Navy on
Union warships.</p>
<p class="quote">
"But," he continued with wonderful dialectic, "but there is a difference
between the right of search to recover deserters from the British Navy and
the right to seize passengers, like Mr. Mason and Mr. Slidell, men of the
highest respectability, regardless of the fact that they were protected by
the British flag!"
</p>
<p class="fst">He played his highest trump, however, at the close of his diatribe.</p>
<p class="quote">

"The other day,"  he bellowed, "while I was on the European Continent, I
heard an observation made as to the course of our conduct in regard to the
United States, and I was unable to reply to the allusion without a blush -- 
that the feeling of every intelligent man upon the Continent was that we
would submit to any outrage and suffer every indignity offered to us by the
Government of the United States. But the pitcher goes so often to the well
that it is broken at last. Our patience had been exercised long enough!  At last we have arrived at facts:
this is a very hard and startling fact [!] and it is the duty of every
Englishman to apprise the Government of how strong and unanimous is the
feeling of this great community of the outrage offered to our flag."
</p>
<p>This senseless rigamarole was greeted with a peal of applause. Opposing
voices were howled down and hissed down and stamped down. To
 the remark of a Mr. Campbell that the whole meeting was irregular, the
inexorable Spence replied: "I perfectly agree with you that it is a little
irregular but at the same time the fact that we have met to consider is
rather an irregular fact." To the proposal of a Mr. Turner to adjourn the
meeting to the following day, in order that "the city of Liverpool can have
its say and not a clique of cotton brokers usurp its name", cries of
"Collar him, throw him out!" resounded from all sides. Unperturbed, Mr.
Turner repeated his motion, which, however, was not put to the vote, again
contrary to all the rules of English meetings. Spence triumphed. But, as a
matter of fact, nothing has done more to cool London's temper than the news
of Mr. Spence's triumph.</p>

<h4>[London,] 7 March 1865</h4>
<p><strong>Dear Fred</strong>,</p>
<p>My brother-in-law is leaving today to return to the Cape. I've got to accompany him onto the ship. So, I'm very short of time — hence just the following in the utmost brevity:</p>
<p>1.<i> Ad vocem Bruhn. </i>A worker in Paris received a letter from a worker in Hamburg saying that Bruhn is slandering us in every way he can. Firstly, he says I owe him 60 talers which I never repaid. Secondly, you and I are said to have sold the Prussian government, or rather ‘Police-Chief Stieber’, a manuscript about the refugees. The Parisian sent the letter to Lessner, who passed it on to me. I replied to Lessner by return of post, for communication to the Parisian, that I had <i>never </i>had any financial dealings with Bruhn (which I believed at that time to be the case), and in general considered that for Bruhn to ever have 60 talers to his name was like something out of Munchausen. Furthermore, I explained the affair of Bangya and the manuscript, in which connection our declaration of April 1853 in the <i>New-Yorker Criminal-Zeitung </i><span class="context">[<i>Hirsch’s Confessions</i>]</span> and references to it in <i>Herr Vogt </i>page such and such were to be consulted. <strong>Well</strong>! Then Bruhn’s letter arrived. So, I racked my brains and think I remember the following: in the spring of 1849 I came to Hamburg to collect money for the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i>. I had just enough in <strong>my pocket</strong> to get to Hamburg. However, stayed 14 days in a <strong>first rate</strong> hotel. I explained to Baron Frisch, who later intended to send us donations, that I needed money to pay the hotel bill and my return fare. I now have a dim recollection that since I didn’t want to take the money as a ‘<strong>present’ </strong>from him and he for his part didn’t want it back, it was agreed that <i>Bruhn </i>who was just as much a scoundrel then as now, should receive it. I had forgotten the whole bloody business; however, I now wrote to Bruhn that I couldn’t remember any financial transaction with <i>him. </i>Since the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung </i>was banned when I got back to Cologne from Hamburg and I myself was kicked out of Prussia, it was possible that in the whirl of events at the time I had forgotten. It is still striking that he waited from 1849 to 1865 to <i>remind </i>me. But it was a simple matter. He should let me know by letter how much he thought he had on me and send me Grubel’s address. I would then write to Grubel myself. If the latter <i>confirmed </i>what he said, his demand would be satisfied. This procedure is absolutely essential, as I am <i>still </i>uncertain about the matter <i>even at this moment, </i>and the way I have been fleeced by claims of this kind is really scandalous.</p>
<p>2. From the <i>enclosed from Schily you will </i>see what transpired in Paris whither we sent Le Lubez to settle the disputes that had broken out there. (We had given <i>Schily </i>ditto <strong>full power</strong> to negotiate, as we were aware of Le Lubez’s bias towards Lefort. Here I should just mention in passing that <i>Beluze, </i>President of the People’s Bank, who controls the few Paris Associations and their organ <i>L'Association, </i>is<i> with </i>Lefort.) <i>What else happens — </i>which will only be concluded this evening, as far as our intervention is concerned — in the <i>next letter.</i></p>
<p>3. The things from <i>Siebel </i>returned. It strikes me as <i>most unfortunate </i>that he gives <i>London </i>as the origin of the notice put in the <i>Düsseldorfer Zeitung, </i>thus exposing <i>me </i>as the presumed author.</p>
<p>4. Letter from Liebknecht enclosed.</p>
<p>5. One copy of the circular from the Geneva <strong>Branch Association</strong> enclosed.</p>
<p>6. The letter from Meissner enclosed.</p>
<p>7.<i> Lange: </i>not to be directly rebuffed. Write and tell him that he would do best to post the thing to you, 2 <strong>copies</strong>, and you would send one to me each time. As he rightly realises himself, after our recent experience we would have to hold back <i>for the present </i>from making contributions to any German paper. He would, of course, have the same right as any other <strong>Editor</strong> of a journal to reprint whatever extracts he liked from your pamphlet.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. M.</p>
<p>The first numbers (2 sheets) of Blind’s <i>Eidgenosse </i>have come, with the only contributions by Blind, Struve and Rasch. Trivia. Emblem consisting of hand with dagger, to kill the ‘tyrants’.</p>

<h4>[London,] 1 February 1865</h4>
<p>Dear <strong>Frederick</strong>,</p>
<p>Enclosed letter from Strohn to be returned; write to me and let me know your thoughts about the publishing business at the same time. </p>
<p>This ‘Siebold’ is the Siebold of champagne fame, <strong>no doubt about that</strong>. I really am rather afraid that he did not merely find my reception of his bubbly enthusiasm very dry, but <strong>that he caught some queer words at Gumpert’s door, as I told you at the time</strong>. At all events, it is nice of the fellow and quite typical of wine-salesman politics to go straight from us to Karl Blind and run as his <strong>messenger</strong> to Hamburg. Has Blind perhaps also placed an order for ‘sparkling wines’ and granted his most gracious protection to scum-scoundrelism as well? I hope for the sake of bubbly’s good reputation that Siebold is no such <strong>venal</strong> scum, although there was no mistaking that while one of his eyes was sparkling with enthusiasm, the other <strong>had an eye to business</strong>. Regarding Freiligrath, I <strong>feel sure</strong> that he is much <strong>too cautious</strong> to agree <i>publicly </i>in any way to collaborate <i>(in partibus </i><span class="context">[to all appearances]</span>, it goes without saying) with Blind. <strong>However, I shall try to ascertain the fact</strong>. At all events, it is very good that Strohn has so gratifyingly baulked Ruge and Blind. I sent off a few sarcastic marginalia to him earlier today, intended specifically for Meissner, concerning the <i>nobile par </i>of antagonistic brothers.</p>
<p>You must excuse the scraps of English in my epistle as there was a <strong>sitting of the Council</strong> yesterday which lasted until <strong>One o'clock</strong>. (‘Liquor’ and ‘smoke’ are <i>banned </i>from these ‘<strong>sittings’.</strong>) The first thing was the answering epistle from Lincoln, which you may find in tomorrow’s <i>Times </i>and certainly in <i>The Daily News </i>and <i>The Star. </i>In the reply to the <strong>London Emancipation Society</strong> (which counts among its members such illustrious figures as Sir Charles Lyell and the ‘Voice of World History’, alias K.B.), published in yesterday’s <i>Evening Star, </i>the old man drily dismisses the fellows with two formal clichés, exactly as he had done in his earlier answer to the <i>Manchester </i>branch of the <strong>Emancipation Society</strong>; whereas his letter to us is in fact everything we could have asked for, and, in particular, the naive assurance that the <i>United States </i>could not involve itself directly in ‘<strong>propagandism’.</strong> At any rate, it is the only answer so far <strong>on the part of the Old Man</strong> that is more than a strictly formal one.</p>
<p><i>Secondly, </i>a delegate was there from the Poles (<i>aristocrats</i>), who have links with the ‘<strong>Literary Society’,</strong> through whom these gentlemen conveyed their solemn assurance, with an eye to the forthcoming <strong>meeting</strong> on Poland, that they are <i>democrats </i>and that every Pole is <i>now </i>a democrat, since the aristocracy has dwindled away to such a degree that they would be <i>mad </i>not to recognise the <i>impossibility </i>of restoring Poland without a peasant rising. <strong>Whether</strong> or not these fellows believe what they say, at all events, the last lesson they had does not seem to have been entirely wasted on them.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly, </i>there were statements from various <strong>trades unions</strong> about their joining. Ditto from an association in <i>Brussels </i>which is promising to organise branches throughout Belgium.</p>
<p>I then handed over an issue of the <i>Daily St. Louis Press </i>which had arrived just yesterday containing leader about our ‘<strong>Address to the Workingmen’ </strong>and an excerpt from it which had obviously been arranged by Weydemeyer.</p>
<p>But now the most remarkable thing of all.</p>
<p>Cremer, <strong>our Honorary General Secretary</strong>, had received a written invitation for the ‘<strong>Council’ </strong>as well as a private visit, from a <strong>Provisional Committee</strong> which is meeting <i>privatim </i>at the London Tavern next Monday. Object: <strong>Monster meeting</strong> for <strong>Manhood Suffrage</strong>. <i>Chairman: — Richard Cobden!</i></p>
<p>The point is this: as E. Jones told us previously, these fellows have been a complete failure in Manchester. They have therefore adopted <strong>a broader platform</strong>, in which <strong>registration ‘for paying poor rate’ </strong>figured instead of <strong>Manhood Suffrage</strong>, however. That is what is stated in the printed circular sent to us. However, since various indications made it clear to them that nothing less than <strong>Manhood Suffrage</strong> can attract <strong>any co-operation whatever on the part of the working classes</strong>, they have announced they are prepared to accept the latter. A <i>big </i>demonstration in London would lead to similar ones in the provinces, write the provincials ‘yet once again’, having ‘all ready’ realised that they are not able <strong>to set the ball a-going</strong>.</p>
<p>The next question raised yesterday was this: should our <strong>Society, i.e. Council</strong>, agree to what these fellows want (they include all the old <strong>sham city agitators</strong> such as Sam. Morley, etc.) and send a few delegates to attend the transactions of their provisional committee as ‘watchmen’? Secondly, if these fellows pledge themselves <i>directly </i>to the slogan of <strong>manhood suffrage</strong> and the <strong>public meeting</strong> is being called under this slogan, should we promise our support? <i>The latter </i>is, you see, just as crucial to these fellows as it was in the American business. Without the <strong>Trades Unions</strong>, no mass <strong>meeting</strong> is possible, and without us, the <strong>Trades Unions</strong> are not to be had. This is also the reason why these gentlemen have come to us.</p>
<p>Opinions were <i>very </i>divided, for which <i>Bright’s </i>latest silly tricks in Birmingham were much to blame.</p>
<p>On my motion, it was decided that: 1) the delegation should be sent (in my motion, I excluded <strong>foreigners</strong> from it; but Eccarius and Lubez were elected on to it as ‘Englishmen’ and <i>silent </i>witnesses) just as ‘observers'; 2) <strong>so far as the meeting is concerned</strong>, we should act with them <i>firstly </i>if <strong>manhood suffrage</strong> is proclaimed directly and publicly in the programme, and <i>secondly </i>if people <i>selected by us </i>are included on the <i>permanent </i>committee, so that they can keep an eye on those fellows and compromise them in the event of fresh treachery, which, as I made plain to all of them, is <i>at any rate intended. </i>I am writing to E. Jones about the matter today.</p>

<h4>[London,] 20 May 1865</h4>
<p><strong>Dear Fred</strong>,</p>
<p>Cutting <strong>enclosed</strong> which includes my address to Johnson.</p>
<p>Edgar’s reappearance did, of course, surprise us greatly. <strong>Quite the fellow I thought him</strong>, and his career quite as I<i> </i>expected it. <strong>It is a pity</strong> that he could not always have been right-hand to Garibaldi He would have suited him to a tee. But the poor devil is still very weak. He will be staying here for some time, apropos of which you could be doing <strong>a good work</strong> by contributing to the replenishment of my <i>wine-cellar.</i></p>
<p>I am working like a horse at the moment, as I must make use of the time when I am fit for work, and the carbuncles are still with me, though they only trouble me locally and do not disturb the brain-pan.</p>
<p>In between times, since one cannot always be writing, I am doing some <strong>differential calculus</strong> dx/dy. I have no patience to read anything else at all. Any other kind of reading always drives me back to my writing-desk.</p>
<p>Special meeting of the ‘<strong>International</strong>’ this evening. A good old codger, an <strong>old Owenist</strong>, <i>Weston </i>(<strong>carpenter</strong>), has put up the following two propositions that he is constantly defending in <i>The Bee-Hive:</i></p>
<p>1. that <strong>a general rate in the rise of the rate of wages</strong> would be of no benefit to the workers;</p>
<p>2. that the <strong>trades unions</strong> for that reason, etc., are <i>harmful.</i></p>
<p>If these two propositions, in which <i>he </i>alone in our <strong>Society</strong> believes, were to be accepted, we should be in a terrible mess, both in respect of the <strong>trades unions</strong> here and the <strong>infection of strikes</strong> now prevailing on the Continent.</p>
<p>He will be supported in the matter by a native Englishman — since non-members are also admitted to this meeting — who has written a pamphlet to the same effect. I am, of course, expected to produce a refutation. I ought therefore really to have worked out my <i>réplique </i>for this evening, but I thought it more important to get on with writing my book, and so I shall have to rely on improvisation.</p>
<p>I know in advance, of course, what the two main <strong>points</strong> will be:</p>
<p>1. that <i>wages </i>determine the value of commodities;</p>
<p>2. that if the capitalists pay 5s. today instead of 4, tomorrow they will sell their commodities for 5s. instead of 4 (being <strong>enabled</strong> to do so by the increased demand).</p>
<p>Trite though that is, and however little it penetrates the topmost surface of things, it is, nevertheless, not easy to explain to the ignorant all the competing economic questions involved. <strong>You can’t compress a course of political economy into 1 hour. But we shall do our best</strong>.</p>
<p>Edgar regards it as a <strong>good omen</strong> that he met you first in England. He liked <strong>Lizzy</strong> very much.</p>
<p><i>Salut. </i></p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. M.</p>
<p>It is a most strange irony of fate that this Edgar, who never exploited anyone other than himself and was always a <strong>workman</strong> in the strictest sense of the word, went through <strong>a war of</strong> and <strong>with starvation</strong> for the slave-owners. Ditto that both brothers-in-law have for the moment been ruined by the American war.</p>

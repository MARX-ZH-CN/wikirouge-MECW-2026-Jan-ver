<h4>London, 11 April [1865]</h4>
<p>Dear <strong>Fred</strong>,</p>
<p>Returned home some twenty-four hours ago. So, for the moment just a few lines to let you know.</p>
<p>Letter from Wilhelmchen enclosed. I sent him the <strong>stamps</strong> he asked for.</p>
<p><i>Quoad </i>B. Becker, I didn’t get to see his dirty work until I got here. But thought reply really was needed <span class="context">[‘the “President of Mankind”’]</span>. (Rüstow and Herwegh have replied in the <i>Nordstern </i>on behalf of Hatzfeldt. Rüstow calls B. Becker a ‘<i>police-spy’.</i>) Sent it to <i>Rheinische </i>and <i>Düsseldorfer. </i>As soon as copies arrive, 1 for you.</p>
<p>I shall attend a <strong>sitting</strong> of the ‘<strong>International</strong>’ this evening for the first time for 3 weeks. In the interval, revolution. Le Lubez and Denoual gone, Dupont <strong>appointed French Secretary</strong>. As a result of Le Lubez’s intrigues, and more particularly those of Major Wolff who is <strong>a tool</strong> in Mazzini’s hand, the Italian delegates Lama and Fontana have left. Pretext: Lefort (who has meanwhile announced his departure in the <i>journal L'Association</i>) must keep his post as <strong>defender general in the Paris press</strong>. The Italian <strong>Working men’s Club</strong> has not withdrawn from the Association, but no longer has a <strong>representative</strong> on the <strong>Council</strong>. Meanwhile, I shall get Bakunin to lay some counter-mines for Mr Mazzini in Florence. The English <strong>Shoemakers’ Union</strong> — 5,000 strong — has joined the Association during <strong>my absence</strong>.</p>
<p>How’s the <strong>cotton-crisis? I want information on that point</strong>.</p>
<p>In great haste.</p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. M.</p>

In No. 16 of your newspaper Herr M. Hess from Paris
casts suspicion on <i>the French members</i>, with whom he is entirely
unacquainted, of <i>the London Central Committee</i> of the International
Working Men's Association with the words:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"There is really no knowing whether it would matter if <i>some
friends of the Palais-Royal <a href="#n1">[1]</a> also belonged to the
London Association</i>, since it is a public one, etc."</p>
<p>In an earlier issue<a href="#n2">[2]</a> , while prattling about
the newspaper <i>L 'Association</i>, the same Herr M. H. made similar insinuations
about the <i>Paris friends</i> of the London Committee. We declare his
insinuations to be preposterous slander.</p>
<p>For the rest, we are glad to find in this incident confirmation
of our conviction that the Paris proletariat is as irreconcilably opposed
as ever to Bonapartism in both its forms, the Tuileries form <a href="#n3">[3]</a>
and the form of the Palais-Royal, and never for a moment considered the
plan of selling its historical honour (or should we, instead of "its <i>historical
honour</i>", say "its historical birthright as bearer of revolution"?)
for a mess of pottage. We recommend this example to the German workers.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>Background</b>: This statement was written by Marx and sent
to Engels for his signature on February 6 1865. By that time, they were
convinced that Schweitzer, the newspaper's editor, was continuing Lassalle's
policy of flirting with the Bismarck Government and was acting in accordance
with Lassalle's dogmas, treating the workers' movement in other countries
with nationalist contempt. Marx and Engels regarded their statement as
a warning to Schweitzer. It was prompted by an item in Der Social-Demokrat
of February 1 which was written by the newspaper's Paris correspondent,
Moses Hess, who libellously accused French members of the International
of being in contact with Bonapartists.</p>
<p>The criticism by Marx and Engels compelled the editors to change
the newspaper's tone to some extent. Issue No. 21 of February 12 1865 carried
an item by Hess in which he withdrew his assertions. For that reason, Marx
and Engels did not insist on the publication of this statement; at the
same times, as is seem from Marx's letter to Engels of February 13, 1865,
they decided to stop contributing to the newspaper for the time being.
Marx and Engels announced their final break with <i>Der Social-Demokrat</i>
on February 23. The text of the statement sent to Schweitzer has not survived.
It is published here according to the rough manuscript attached to Marx's
letter of February 6 to Engels. A passage from the statement was later
quoted by Marx in the statement on the reasons for their refusal to contribute
to <i>Der Social-Demokrat</i>, published in the latter half of March 1865
in the <i>Berliner Reform</i> and other newspapers. (From the <i>Collected
Works</i>)</p>

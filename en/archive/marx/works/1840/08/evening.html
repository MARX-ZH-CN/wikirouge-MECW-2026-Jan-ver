<h3>1</h3>
<p class="verse">I sit in the garden. ‘Neath the ocean’s rim<br>
The old day’s sun has slowly slipped from sight,<br>
And hidden shafts that draw their strength from him<br>
Now fill the heavens with scintillating light.<br>
But with day’s brilliance fading from the sky,<br>
The flowers stand and grieve in silent sadness;<br>
Meanwhile the birds, safe in the tree-tops high,<br>
Carol their love-songs full of joy and gladness.<br>
Ships that have traced the oceans with their wake<br>
Now lie at anchor in the peaceful bay.<br>
From end to end the timbered bridges shake<br>
As the tired people trudge their homeward way.<br>
The cool wine bubbles in the crystal glass.<br>
I leaf through Caldetön’s great comedies,<br>
Drinking my fill to very drunkenness<br>
On heady wine and headier tragedies.</p>
<h3>2</h3>
<p class="verse">The radiance in the West is almost gone.<br>
Patience! A new day’s coming — Freedom’s day!<br>
The sun shall mount his ever-shining throne<br>
And Night’s black cares be banished far away.<br>
New flowers shall grow, but not in nursery beds<br>
We raked ourselves and sowed with chosen seeds:<br>
All earth shall be their garden full of light;<br>
’ Written in English in the original. (Shelley, Queen Mab.)<br>
All plants shall flourish in far alien lands.<br>
The Palm of Peace shall grace the Northern strands,<br>
The Rose of Love shall crown the frozen wight,<br>
The sturdy Oak shall seek the Southern shore<br>
To make the club that strikes the despot down,<br>
And he who brings his nation peace once more<br>
Shall wear upon his head the oak-leaf crown.<br>
The Aloe, flourishing all over Earth,<br>
Is like the People’s spirit everywhere,<br>
As prickly, coarse, and lacking grace as they are,<br>
Till, with a crash, there suddenly bursts forth<br>
Through every obstacle a blossom bright — <br>
The Freedom flame, that glowed concealed from sight;<br>
Its scent is far more like to reach the Lord<br>
Than all the incense of the pious fraud.<br>
Only the Cypress-trees are left alone,<br>
Abandoned in the grove, their meaning gone.</p>
<h3>3</h3>
<p class="verse">The birds on their green branches greet the dawn<br>
With paeans of tumultuous song, and know<br>
That when the drifting cloudlets have withdrawn<br>
Their steamy summits to the vales below,<br>
Then shall the sun begin to mount his throne — <br>
These birds are minstrel singers, every one;<br>
Their words fly free as the free winds that blow;<br>
And winds and words as one united go. <br>
These songsters do not haunt the castle walls<br>
(Those stately homes have long since tumbled down),<br>
But, in proud oaks unbent by howling squalls,<br>
Boldly they look towards the rising sun,<br>
Though they be dazzled when his brilliance falls<br>
To ring the earth with radiant light around.<br>
1, too, am one of Freedom’s minstrel band.<br>
’twas to the boughs of <i>Börne’s</i> great oak-tree<br>
I soared, when in the vales the despot’s hand<br>
Tightened the strangling chains round Germany.<br>
Yes, I am of those plucky birds that make<br>
Their course through Freedom’s bright aethereal sea.<br>
Though I be just a sparrow in their wake,<br>
Rather that little sparrow would I be<br>
Than the caged nightingale that can’t take wing<br>
And only to a prince’s car may sing.</p>

<p class="verse">No longer does the cargo vessel press<br>
Across the ocean to enrich the few<br>
Or swell the greedy merchant’s revenue:<br>
It bears the seeds of human happiness.<br>
It is a noble stallion prancing high,<br>
Whose rider slays all hypocrites and crawlers,<br>
It is the fearless scourge of human dolours,<br>
It is a thought that dreams of Liberty.<br>
The flag bears not the royal coat of arms<br>
For the ship’s frightened crew to tremble under;<br>
It bears the cloud on which, after the thunder,<br>
After the lightning bolts of raging storms,<br>
The reconciling Freedom rainbow forms.</p>
<h3>5</h3>
<p class="verse">The bridge of Love shall throw its spans unseen<br>
Across from heart to heart; between the piers<br>
Runs Passion’s wild and ever-rushing stream,<br>
The swiftly flowing torrent of the years.<br>
The bridge is diamond hard: it will not sag.<br>
Across goes Freedom’s bravely shining flag.<br>
Across goes Man. Where'er his feet may lead him,<br>
Wherever he may choose to cast his eye,<br>
He sees a friendly roof against the sky<br>
And knows that food and drink are there to meet him;<br>
A very home from home awaits to greet him,<br>
Wherever he may make his bed and lie.<br>
A bridge of purer faith shall pierce the clouds.<br>
Man shall ascend it, climbing without fear<br>
Its heavenward steps to gaze on, humbly proud,<br>
The Eternal Archetype of All the Spirits.<br>
Out of his bosom issues forth Mankind,<br>
And to his bosom Men return again,<br>
All conscious links in the great spirit-chain<br>
By which Eternal Matter is confined.</p>
<h3>6</h3>
<p class="verse">New wine shall fill your glasses to the brim,<br>
Pure Freedom wine’s intoxicating brew:<br>
Not the unwary senses to bedim,<br>
But jaded senses to exchange for new,<br>
That with revived perception you may hear<br>
The spheres in heaven singing high and low;<br>
That the blood coursing through your veins may clear,<br>
Transformed into pure Aether, which flows through<br>
The Infinities; that your eye-beams may spear<br>
Primordial Space, like warriors bold that go<br>
To storm the starry summits without fear.<br>
Between, like jack-o'-Lanterns in the sky,<br>
Images of past woe are gliding by.</p>
<h3>7</h3>
<p class="verse">And there shall rise another Calderön,<br>
Pearl-fisher in the tide of poetry,<br>
With images like flames ascending from<br>
The layered wood of the sweet Cedar-tree.<br>
With golden lyre, he shall exalt in song<br>
The bloody stamping out of Tyranny.<br>
Mankind shall hear proud Victory’s refrain,<br>
And Peace shall flourish in the world again.<br>
He too shall sing how Mankind made a stand<br>
Against the cruel hordes of Tyranny<br>
Upon <i>Mantible Bridge</i>* <a href="../../cw/volume02/footnote.html#88" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[88]</sup></a>; how that brave band<br>
Fought on through levelled spears to victory<br>
And so set foot on Freedom’s hallowed land;<br>
How <i>Doctor of His Honour</i>** came to be<br>
Man, like the <i>Constant Prince</i>,*** condemned to languish<br>
In chains until deliverance from anguish;<br>
How Freedom came, <i>The Daughter of the Air</i>,****<br>
Descending earthwards from aethereal space<br>
To sing her magic songs, so wondrous fair;</p>
<p class="verse">How <i>Life</i> became a <i>Dream</i>***** of joy and grace,<br>
And how the Cup of Happiness shone clear<br>
Of furious ferment showing not a trace;<br>
And how the sun shall put the clouds to flight,<br>
Bringing sweet <i>April-and-May-Mornings</i>****** light.</p>
<h3>8</h3>
<p class="verse">But say, when is the new sun going to rise?<br>
When will the bad old times be cracked asunder?<br>
We saw the old sun sinking in the skies  — <br>
How long must night’s oppression keep us under?<br>
The melancholy moon peers through the cloud,<br>
And white mists, bivouacked in the vales below,<br>
Hide all that lives on earth beneath their shroud.<br>
Like blind men tapping through the dark we go.<br>
Patience! For look, already heavenward bound,<br>
The sun would chase the gloomy clouds away.<br>
The very mists that crawl along the ground<br>
Are Spirits’ dawn-breeze-wakened roundelay.<br>
The morning star dances his upward way.<br>
The mists are pierced by shafts of blood-red fire.<br>
Do not the flowers unfold to greet the day?<br>
Do you not hear the joyful feathered choir?<br>
Now half the heavens are filled with radiance bright.<br>
The snow-capped mountains blaze with ruby light.<br>
The golden clouds rear up their noble heads<br>
Like the sun’s fiery chariot-drawing steeds.<br>
Look yonder, where the densest light rays run<br>
In joyous throng to greet the new-born sun!<br>

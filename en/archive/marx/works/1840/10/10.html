<p class="verse">In the camp’s finest tent we'd sat all night<br>
And mingled Spanish wine with German song.<br>
The fields were turning grey in dawn’s first light;<br>
Our eyes were aching — we'd stayed up so long.<br>
The sun’s rays peeped into our tent and found<br>
Our sherry bottles drained, in disarray.<br>
The hour was late. Time we were homeward bound.<br>
Come, let us mount the horses and away!</p>
<p class="verse">We flew. After carousing all night long,<br>
What bliss to feel the freshness of the morrow.<br>
Still in our ears the sound of strings and song;<br>
Still far away the long day’s care and worry.<br>
The shades of night had vanished. From the sky<br>
Light fell on river, trees, fields bathed in dew.<br>
We all looked up to trace with joyful eye<br>
The sun’s bright progress through the cloudless blue.</p>
<p class="verse">We're home. Our steeds coursed well. Now I stand here<br>
Upon the threshold of work’s tribulations.<br>
Here is the paper. Let me draw fresh cheer<br>
By drinking from the well-spring of the nations.<br>
Russia, Great Britain, Turkish catastrophes!<br>
And now for Germany — does all go well?<br>
Ah, here.... What? Dead? Can I believe my eyes?<br>
You, Immermann, must also bid farewell?<br>
Defiant heart, so full of noble scorn,<br>
Must you depart, then, for eternity,<br>
Now that we see the rose despite the thorn<br>
And bow to you in all humility?<br>
Now that, like Schiller, proudly you beheld<br>
Your people hang on every word from you?<br>
Now that the love within your bosom held<br>
Had blossomed forth with shining rays anew?</p>
<p class="verse">Aloof in German poetry’s sacred grove,<br>
You shunned your fellow bards’ vociferous throng,<br>
And by the Rhine in solitude you wove<br>
The images of many a gentle song.<br>
The mob’s harsh clamour never came to hurt you<br>
In the flower garden where you toiled away.<br>
So few the stories they could spread about you;<br>
Living, you were a legend in your day.</p>
<p class="verse">Because the maltitude, that never can<br>
Conceive what power inspires the poet’s lays,<br>
Why should they heed the silent, serious man<br>
Who wanders far from their well-trodden ways?<br>
But you, 0 Immermann, that now have died,<br>
Wanted to wrestle with yourself, alone,<br>
And all the bitter jarring strife inside<br>
That you grew up with, master on your own.</p>
<p class="verse">So, meditating through the long dark night<br>
That held in thrall our German poetry,<br>
In solitude you fought the inner fight<br>
And battled through to see the dawning day.<br>
When far above your dwelling’s mossy stones<br>
July’s wild thunder rolled away at last,<br>
You sent into the world your <i>Epigones</i>,<br>
That requiem for a generation past.</p>
<p class="verse">And yet you saw the rising generation,<br>
Those in whose hearts the youthful fires blaze,<br>
Speak loudly to defend your reputation,<br>
Your right to wear the bard’s full crown of bays.<br>
In your abode you saw us drawing nigh,<br>
You saw us silent at your feet, as we<br>
Looked up into your rapt and thoughtful eye<br>
And listened to your rolling poetry.</p>
<p class="verse">Now that the people, who forgot your name,<br>
Have welcomed you with shouts of joy, bestowing<br>
On you your rightful laurels of acclaim,<br>
0 Immermann, is this a time for going?<br>
Farewell! Here in this land of Germany<br>
Poets to match your skill are very few.<br>
I settled down to work, and swore to be<br>
As German, and as strong and firm as you.</p>

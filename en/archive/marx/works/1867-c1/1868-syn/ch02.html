<h3>1.  THE GENERAL FORMULA FOR CAPITAL </h3>
<p>
The circulation of commodities is the starting point of capital.  Hence, 
commodity production, commodity circulation, and the latter's developed 
form, commerce, are always the historical groundwork from which capital 
arises.  The modern history of capital dates from the creation of modern 
world trade and the world market in the 16th century.  (P.106 [146]) 
 
 <p>
If we consider only the economic forms produced by commodity 
circulation, we find that its final product is money, and the latter is 
the first form in which capital appears.  Historically, capital 
invariably confront landed property at first as moneyed wealth, the 
capital of the merchant and the usurer, and even today all new capital 
first comes on the stage in the shape of money that by definite 
processes has to be transformed into capital.  
 
  <p>
Money-as-money and money-as-capital differ, to being with, only in their 
form of circulation.  Alongside C - M - C, the form M - C - M, buying in 
order to sell, also occurs.  Money that describes <i>this</i> form of 
circulation in its movement <i>becomes</i> capital, is already capital in 
itself — i.e., by its destination.  
 
  <p>
The result of M - C - M is M - M — the indirect exchange of money for 
money.  I buy cotton for 100 pounds sterling and sell it for 110; 
ultimately, I have exchanged 100 for 110, money for money.  
 
  <p>
If this process yielded at its outcome the same money-value that was 
originally put into it — 100 pounds sterling out of 100 — it would be 
absurd.  Yet, whether the merchant realizes 100, 110, or merely 50 for 
his 100 pounds sterling, his money has described a specific movement 
quite different from that of commodity circulation, C - M - C.  From the 
examination of the differences in form between this movement and C - M - 
C, the difference in content will also be found.  
 
  <p>
The two phases of the process, taken separately, are the same as in C - 
M - C.  But, there is a great difference in the process as a whole.  In 
C - M - C, money constitutes the intermediary, the commodity the 
starting point and the finish; in this case, the commodity is the 
intermediary, with money the starting point and the finish.  In C - M - 
C, the money is spent once and for all; in M - C - M, it is merely 
advanced, it is to be got back again.  It flows back to its starting 
point.  Here, therefore, is already a palpable difference between the 
circulation of money-as-money and money-as-capital.  
 
  <p>
In C - M - C, money can return to its starting point only through the 
repetition of the whole process, through the sale of fresh commodities.  
Hence, the reflux is independent of the process itself.  In M - C - M, 
on the other hand, it is conditioned from the outset by the structure of 
the process itself, which is incomplete if the return flow fails.  
(P.110 [149]) 
 
  <p>
The ultimate object of C - M - C is use-value, that of M - C - M 
exchange-value itself.  
 
  <p>
In C - M - C, both extremes possess the same definiteness of economic 
form.  Both are commodities, and of equal value.  But, at the same time, 
they are qualitatively different use-values, and the process has social 
metabolism as its content.  In M - C - M, the operation, at first 
glance, seems tautological, purposeless.  To exchange 100 pounds for 100 
pounds, and in a roundabout way to boot, seems absurd.  One sum of money 
is distinguishable from another only by its size; M - C - M acquires its 
meaning, therefore, only through the quantitative difference in the 
extremes.  More money is withdrawn from circulation than has been thrown 
into it.  The cotton bought for 100 is sold, say, for 100 + 10; the 
process, thus, follows the formula M - C - M', where M' = M + delta-M.  
[The delta-symbol, actually being a triangle, representing the 
difference, the change in amount.] This delta-M, this increment, is 
surplus-value.  The value originally advanced not only remains intact in 
circulation, but adds to itself a surplus-value, <i>expands</i> itself — and 
this movement converts money into capital.  
 
  <p>
In C - M - C, they may also be a difference in the value of the 
extremes, but it is purely accidental in this form of circulation, and  
C - M - C does not become absurd when the extremes are equivalent — on 
the contrary, this is rather the necessary conditions for the normal 
process.  
 
  <p>
The repetition of C - M - C is regulated by an ultimate object outside 
itself; consumption, the satisfaction of definite needs.  In M - C - M, 
on the other hand, the beginning and the end are the same — money — 
and that already makes the movement endless.  Granted, M + delta-M 
differs quantitatively from M, but it, too, is merely a limited sum of 
money; if it were spent, it would no longer be capital; if it were 
withdrawn from circulation, it would remain stationary as a hoard.  Once 
the need for expansion of value is given, it sexists for M' as well as 
for M, and the movement of capital is boundless, because its goal is as 
much unattained at the end of the process as at the beginning.  
(Pp.111,112 [149-51]) As the representative of this process, the owner 
of money becomes a capitalist.  
 
  <p>
If, in commodity circulation, the exchange-value attains at most a form 
independent of the use-value of commodities, it suddenly manifests 
itself here as a substance in process, endowed with motion of its own, 
for which commodity and money are mere forms.  More than that, as 
original value, it is differentiated from itself as surplus-value.  It 
becomes money in process, and as such, capital.  (P.116 [154]) 
 
  <p>
M - C - M' appears, indeed, to be a form peculiar to merchant's capital 
alone.  BUt, industrial capital, too, is money which is converted into 
commodities, and by the latter's sale reconverted into more money.  Acts 
that take place between purchase and sale, outside the sphere of 
circulation, effect no change in this.  Lastly, in interest-bearing 
capital, the process appears as M - M' without any intermediary, value 
that is, as it were, greater than itself.  (P.117 [155])

<h3>2.  CONTRADICTIONS IN THE GENERAL FORMULA </h3>
<p>
The form of circulation by which money becomes capital contradicts all 
previous laws bearing on the nature of commodities, of value, of money 
and of circulation itself.  Can the purely formal differences of 
inverted order of succession cause this? 
 
  <p>
What is more, this inversion exists only for one of the three 
transacting persons.  As a capitalist, I buy commodities from A and sell 
them to B.  A and B appear merely as simple buyers and sellers of 
commodities.  In both cases, I confront them merely as a simple owner of 
money or owner of commodities, confronting one as buyer or money, the 
other as seller or commodity, but neither of them as a capitalist or a 
representative of something that is more than money or commodity.  For 
A, the transaction began with a sale; for B, it ended with a purchase, 
hence, just as in commodity circulation.  Moreover, if I base the right 
to surplus-value upon the simple sequence, A could sell to B directly 
and the chance of surplus-value would be eliminated.  
 
  <p>
Assume that A and B buy commodities from each other directly.  As far as 
use-value is concerned, both may profit; A may even produce more of his 
commodity than B could produce in the same time, and vice versa, whereby 
both would profit again.  But otherwise with exchange-value.  Here, 
equal values are exchanged for each other, even if money, as the medium 
of circulation, intervenes.  (P.119 [156-58]) 
 
  <p>
Abstractly considered, only a change in form of the commodity takes 
places in simple commodity circulation, if we except the substitution of 
one use-value for another.  So far, as it involves only a change in form 
of its exchange-value, it involves the exchange of equivalents, if the 
phenomenon proceeds in a pure form.  Commodities can, indeed, be sold at 
prices differing from their values, but this would mean a violation of 
the law of commodity exchange.  In its pure form, it is an exchange of 
equivalents, hence no medium for enriching oneself.  (P.120 [158-59]) 
 
  <p>
Hence, the error of all endeavors to derive surplus-value from commodity 
circulation.  Condillac (P.121 [159]), Newman (P.122 [160]).  
 
  <p>
But let us assume that the exchange does not take place in a pure form, 
that non-equivalents are exchanged.  Let us assume that each seller 
sells his commodity at 10 per cent above its value.  everything remains 
the same; what each one gains as a seller, he loses in turn as a buyer.  
Just as if the value of money had changed by 10 per cent.  Likewise, if 
the buyers bought everything at 10 per cent below value.  (P.123 
[160-61], Torrens.) 
 
  <p>
The assumption that surplus-value arises from a rise in prices 
presupposes that a class exists which buys and does not sell — i.e., 
consumers and does not produce, which constantly receives money gratis.  
To sell commodities above their value to this class means merely to get 
back, by cheating, part of the money given away gratis.  (Asia Minor and 
Rome.) Yet, the seller always remains the cheated one and cannot grow 
richer, cannot form surplus-value thereby.  
 
  <p>
Let us take the case of cheating.  A sells to B wine worth 40 pounds 
sterling in exchange for grain worth 50.  A has gained 10.  But A and B 
together have only 90.  A has 50 and B only 40; value has been 
transferred but not created.  The capitalist class, as a whole, in any 
country, cannot cheat itself.  (P.126 [162-63]) 
 
  <p>
Hence: if equivalents are exchanged, no surplus-value results; and if 
non-equivalents are exchanged, still no surplus-value results.  
Commodity circulation creates no new value.  
 
  <p>
That is why the oldest and most popular forms of capital — merchant 
capital and usurers' capital — are not considered here.  If the 
expansion of merchant capital is not to be explained by mere cheating, 
many intermediate factors, lacking here as yet, are required.  Even more 
so for usurers', and interest-bearing, capital.  It will later be seen 
that both are derived forms, and why they occur historically before 
modern capital.  
 
  <p>
Hence, surplus-value cannot originate in circulation.  But outside it? 
Outside it, the commodity owner is the simple producer of his commodity, 
the value of which depends upon the quantity of his own labour, contained 
in it, measured according to a definite social law; this value is 
expressed in money of account — e.g., in a price of 10 pounds.  BUt 
this value is not at the same time a value of 11 pounds; his labour 
creates values, but not self-expanding values.  It can add more value to 
existing value, but this occurs only through the addition of more labour.  
Thus, the commodity producer cannot produce surplus-value outside the 
sphere of circulation, without coming in contact with other commodity 
owners.  
 
  <p>
Hence, capital must originate in commodity, yet not in it.  (P.128 
[165-66]) 
  <p>
Thus: 
 
 <p class="quote">
     the transformation of money into capital has to be explained on the 
     basis of the laws inherent to the exchange of commodities, the 
     exchange of equivalents forming the starting point.  Our owners of 
     money, as yet the mere chrysalis of a capitalist, has to buy his 
     commodities at their value, to sell them at their value, and yet at 
     the end of this process, to extract more value than he put into it.  
     His development into a butterfly must take in the sphere of 
     circulation and yet not in it.  These are the conditions of the 
     problem.  Hic Rhodus, hic salta! (P.129 [166]) 
     </p>
<a id="3"></a>
<h3>3.  THE BUYING AND SELLING OF LABOUR-POWER </h3>
<p>
The change in value of money that is to be converted into capital cannot 
take place in that money itself, for in buying, it merely realizes the 
price of the commodity; and on the other hand, as long as it remains 
money, it does not change the magnitude of its value; and in selling, 
too, it merely converts the commodity from its bodily form into its 
money-form.  The change must, therefore, take place in the commodity of 
M - C - M; but not in its exchange-value, since equivalents are 
exchanged; it can only arise from its use-value as such — that is, from 
its consumption.  For that purpose, a commodity is required whose 
use-value possess the property of being the source of exchange-value — 
and this does exist — labour-power.  (P.130 [167]) 
 
 <p>
But, for the owner of money to find labour-power in the market as a 
commodity, it must be sold by its own possessor — that is, it must be 
free labour-power.  Since buyer and seller as contracting parties are 
both juridically equal persons, labour-power must be sold only 
temporarily — since in a sale, en bloc, the seller no longer remains 
the seller, but becomes a commodity himself.  But then the owner, 
instead of being able to sell commodities in which his labour is 
embodied, must rather be in a position where he has to sell his 
labour-power itself as a commodity.  (P.131 [168-69]) 
 
 <p>
For the conversion of his money into capital, therefore, the owner of 
money must find in the commodity market the free labourer, free in the 
double sense that as a free man he can dispose of his labour-power as 
<i>his</i> commodity, and that, on the other hand, he has no other 
commodities to sell, has no ties, is free of all things necessary for 
the realization of his labour-power.  (P.132 [168-69]) 
 
 <p>
Parenthetically, the relation between money owner and labour-power owner 
is not a natural one, or a social one common to all ages, but a 
<i>historical</i> one, the product of many economic revolutions.  So, too, do 
the economic categories considered up to now bear their historical 
stamp.  To become a commodity, a product must no longer be produced as 
the immediate means of subsistence.  The mass of products can assume 
commodity-form only within a specific mode of production, the capitalist 
mode, although commodity production and circulation can take place even 
where the mass of products never become commodities.  Likewise, money 
can exist in all periods that have attained a certain level of commodity 
circulation; the specific money-forms, from mere equivalent to world 
money, presuppose various stages of development; nevertheless, a very 
slightly developed circulation of commodities can give rise to all of 
them.  Capital, on the other hand, arises only under the above 
condition, and this one condition comprises a world's history.  (P.133 
[169-70]) 
 
 <p>
Labour-power has an exchange-value which is determined, like that of all 
other commodities, by the labour-time required for its production, and 
hence for its reproduction aa well.  The value of labour-power is the 
value of the means of subsistence necessary for the maintenance of its 
owner — that is, his maintenance in a state of normal capacity for 
work.  This depends upon climate, natural conditions, etc., and also on 
the given historical standard of life in each country and for each 
particular epoch.  Moreover, his maintenance includes the means of 
subsistence for his substitutes — i.e., his children — in order that 
the race of these peculiar commodity owners may perpetuate itself.  
Furthermore, for skilled labour, the cost of education.  (P.135 [170-72]) 
 
 <p>
The minimum limit of the value of labour-power is the value of the 
physically indispensable means of subsistence.  If the price of 
labour-power falls to this minimum, it falls below its value, since the 
latter presupposes normal, not stunted, quality of labour-power.  (P.135 
[173]) 
 
 <p>
The nature of labour implies that labour-power is consumed only after 
conclusion of the contract, and, as money is usually the means of 
payment for such commodities in all countries with the capitalist mode 
of production, the labour-power is paid for only after it is consumed.  
everywhere, therefore, the labourer gives credit to the capitalist.  
(P.137,138 [174]) 
 
 <p>
The process of consuming labour-power is at the same time the process of 
producing commodities and surplus-value and this consumption takes place 
outside the sphere of circulation.  (P.140 [175-76])

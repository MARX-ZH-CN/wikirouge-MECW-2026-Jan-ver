<h3>1.  THE CONCEPT OF RELATIVE SURPLUS-VALUE </h3>
<p>
For a given working-day, surplus-labour can be increased only by reducing 
the necessary labour; this can, in turn, be obtained — apart from 
lowering wages below value — only by reducing the value of labour, that 
is, by reducing the price of the necessary means of subsistence.  
(Pp.291-93 [312-15]) This, in turn, is to be attained only by increasing 
the productive power of labour, by revolutionizing the mode of production 
itself.  
 
 <p>
The surplus-value produced by lenthening the working-day is absolute; 
that produced by shortening the necessary labour-time, is <i>relative</i> 
surplus-value.  (P.295 [315]) 
 
 <p>
In order to lower the value of labour, the increase in productive power 
must seize upon those branches of industry whose products determine the 
value of labour-power — ordinary means of subsistence, substitutes for 
the same, and their raw materials, etc.  Proof of how competition makes 
the increased productive power manifest in a lower commodity price.  
(Pp.296-99 [316-19]) 
 
 <p>
The value of commodities is in inverse ratio to the productivity of 
labour — as is also the value of labour-power — because it depends on 
the price of commodities.  Relative surplus-value, on the contrary, is 
directly proportional to the productivity of labour.  (P.299 [319]) 
 
 <p>
The capitalists is not interested in the absolute value of commodities, 
but only in the surplus-value incorporated in them.  Realization of 
surplus-value implies refunding of the value advanced.  Since, according 
to p.299 [320], the same process of increasing productive power lowers 
the value of commodities and increases the surplus-value contained in 
them, it is clear why the capitalist, whose sole concern is the 
production of exchange-value, continually strives to depress the 
exchange-value of commodities.  (Cf.  Quesnay, p.300 [320]) 
 
 <p>
Hence, in capitalist production, economizing labour through developing 
productive power by no means aims at shortening the working-day — the 
latter may even be lengthened.  We may read, therefore, in economists of 
the stamp of McCulloch, Ure, Senior, and tutti quanti, on one page that 
the labourer owes a debt of gratitude to capital for developing the 
productive forces, and on the next page that he must prove his gratitude 
by working in future for 15 hours instead of 10.  The object of this 
development of productive forces is only to shorten the necessary labour 
and to lengthen the labour for the capitalist.  
 
 
 
 <a id="2"></a>
<h3>2.  CO-OPERATION </h3>
<p>
According to p.288 [309], capitalist production requires an individual 
capital big enough to employ a fairly large number of workers at a time; 
only when he himself is wholly released from labour does the employer of 
labour become a full-grown capitalist.  The activity of a large number of 
workers, at the same time, in the same field of work, for the production 
of the same kind of commodity, under the command of the same capitalist, 
constitutes, historically and logically, the starting point of 
capitalist production.  (P.302 [322]) 
 
 <p>
At first, therefore, there is only a quantitative difference compared to 
the past, when fewer labourers were employed by one employer.  But a 
modification takes place at once.  The large number of labourers already 
guarantees that the employer gets real average labour, which is not the 
case with the small master, who must pay the average value of labour 
nonetheless; in the case of small production, the inequalities are 
compensated for society at large, but not for the individual master.  
Thus, the law of the production of surplus-value is fully realized for 
the individual producer only when he produces as a capitalist, and sets 
many labourers to work at the same time — hence, from the outset, 
average social labour.  (Pp.303-04 [322-24]) 
 
 <p>
Moreover: economy in means of production is achieved through large-scale 
operation alone; less transfer of value to the product by constant 
capital components arises solely from their joint consumption in the 
labour process of many workmen.  That is how the instruments of labour 
acquire a social character before the labour process itself does so — up 
to this time, merely similar processes side-by-side.  (P.305 [325]) 
 
 <p>
The economy in the means of production is to be considered here only 
insofar as it cheapens commodities and, thus, lowers the value of labour.  
The extent to which it alters the ratio of surplus-value to the total 
capital advanced (c + v) will not be considered until Book III.  This 
splitting up is quite in keeping with the spirit of capitalist 
production; since it makes the working conditions confront the worker 
independently, economy in the means of production appears to be a 
distinct operation, which does not concern him and has, therefore, no 
connection with the methods by which the productivity of the labour-power 
consumed by the capitalist is increased.  
 <p>
The form of labour of many persons, methodically working together and 
alongside one another in the same production process, or in related 
processes, is called co-operation.  (P.306 [325]) (Concours des forces.  
Destutt de Tracy.) 
 
 <p>
The sum-total of the mechanical forces of individual workers differs 
substantially from the potential mechanical force developed when many 
hands act together at one time in the same undivided operation (lifting 
weights, etc.).  Co-operation, from the very start, creates a productive 
power that is, in itself, a mass power.  
 
 <p>
Furthermore, in most productive work, mere social contact creates a 
spirit of emulation which raises the individual efficiency of each, so 
that 12 workers turn out more work in a joint working-day of 144 hours 
than 12 workers in 12 distinct working-days, or one worker in 12 
successive days.  (P.307 [326]) 
 
 <p>
Although many may be doing the same or similar things, the individual 
labour of each may still represent a different phase of the labour process 
(chains of persons passing something along), whereby co-operation again 
saves labour.  Likewise, when a building is started from several sides at 
once.  The combined worker, or collective worker, has hands and eyes 
before and behind and is, to a certain degree, omnipresent.  (P.308 
[327]) 
 
 <p>
In complicated labour processes, co-operation permits the special 
processes to be distributed and to be done simultaneously, thus 
shortening the labour-time for manufacturing the whole product.  (P.308 
[327]) 
 
 <p>
In many spheres of production, there are critical periods when many 
workers are needed (harvesting, herring catches, etc.).  Here, only 
co-operation can be of aid.  (P.309 [328]) 
 
 <p>
On the one hand, co-operation extends the field of production and, thus, 
becomes a necessity for work requiring great spatial continuity of the 
working arena (drainage, road-building, dam construction, etc.); on the 
other hand, it contracts the arena by concentrating the workers in one 
work-place, thus cutting down costs.  (P.310 [328-29]) 
 
 <p>
In all these forms, co-operation is the specific productive power of the 
combined working-day, social productive power of labour.  The latter 
arises from co-operation itself.  In systematic joint work with others, 
the worker sheds his individual limitations and develops the 
capabilities of his species.  
 
 <p>
Now, wage-labourers cannot co-operate unless the <i>same</i> capitalist 
employs them simultaneously, pays them and provides them with 
instruments of labour.  Hence, the scale of co-operation depends upon how 
much capital a capitalist has.  The requirement that a certain amount of 
capital be present to make its owner a capitalist now becomes the 
material condition for the conversion of the numerous dispersed and 
independent labour processes into one combined social labour process.  
 
 <p>
In a like manner, capital's command over labour was, up to now, only the 
formal result of the relation between capitalist and labourer; now it is 
the necessary prerequisite for the labour process itself; the capitalist 
represents combination in the labour process.  In co-operation, control 
of the labour process becomes the function of capital, and, as such, it 
acquires specific characteristics.  (P.312 [330]) 
 
 <p>
In accordance with the aim of capitalist production — the greatest 
possible self-expansion of capital — this control is at the same time 
the function of the greatest possible exploitation of a social labour 
process, and, hence, involves the inevitable antagonism between 
exploiter and exploited.  Moreover, control of proper utilization of the 
instruments of labour.  Finally, the connection between the various 
workers' functions lies outside them, in capital, so that their own 
unity confronts them as the capitalist's authority, as an outside will.  
Capitalist control is, thus, twofold — 
 
 <p class="quote">
     1.  a social labour process for producing a product; 
     
  <p class="quote">
     2.  a process of self-expansion of capital — 
 
 <p>
and in its form despotic.  This despotism now evolves its own peculiar 
forms: the capitalist, just relieved from actual labour himself, now 
hands over immediate supervision to an organized band of officers and 
non-coms, who themselves are wage-labourers of capital.  In slavery, the 
economists count these supervision expenses as faux frais; but in 
capitalist production, they bluntly identify control, so far as it 
arises from the nature of the social labour process.  (Pp.313,314 
[332,332]) 
 
 <p>
The leadership of industry becomes the attribute of capital, just as in 
feudal times the functions of general and judge were attributes of 
landed property.  (P.314 [332]) 
 
 <p>
The capitalist buys 100 individual labour-powers, and gets, in return, a 
combined labour-power of 100.  He does <i>not</i> pay for the combined 
labour-power of 100.  When the labourers enter the combined labour process, 
they already cease to belong to themselves; they are incorporated in 
capital.  Thus, the social productive power of labour appears as the 
productive power immanent in capital.  (P.315 [333]) 
 <p>
Examples of co-operation among the ancient Egyptians.  (P.316 [333-34]) 
 <p>
Primitive co-operation at the beginnings of civilization, among hunting 
peoples, nomads, or in Indian communities, is based: 
 
  <p class="quote">
     (1) on common ownership of the means of production; 
 
  <p class="quote">
     (2) on the natural attachment of the individual to the tribe and 
         the primeval community.  
         
 <p>
The sporadic co-operation in antiquity, the Middle Ages, and in modern 
colonies is based upon direct rule and violence, mostly slavery.  
Capitalist co-operation, on the contrary, presupposes the free 
wage-labourer.  Historically, it appears in direct opposition to peasant 
economy and the independent handicrafts (whether in guilds or not), and 
in this connection, as a historical form peculiar to, and 
distinguishing, the capitalist production process.  It is the first 
change experienced by the labour process when subjected to capital.  
Thus, here at once: 
 
  <p class="quote">
     (1) the capitalist mode of production presents itself as a 
         historical condition for the transformation of the labour 
         process into a social process; 
 
  <p class="quote">
     (2) this social form of the labour process presents itself as a 
         method of capital labour more profitable by increasing its 
         productivity.  (P.317 [335]) 
         
 <p>
Co-operation, as considered so far, in its <i>elementary</i> form, coincides 
with production on a larger scale, but it does not constitute a fixed 
form characteristic of a particular epoch, of capitalist production, and 
it still exists today, when capital operates on a large scale without 
division of labour, or machinery playing an important part.  Thus, 
although co-operation is the basic form of the whole capitalist 
production, its <i>elementary</i> form appears as a particular form alongside 
its more developed forms.  (P.318 [335]) 
 
 
 <a id="3"></a>
<h3>3.  DIVISION OF LABOUR AND MANUFACTURE </h3>
<p>
Manufacture, the classic form of co-operation based upon division of 
labour, prevails from about 1550 to 1770.  It arises: 
 
  <p class="quote">
     (1) Either through the assemblage of different crafts, each of 
         which performs a detail operation — e.g., vehicle building — 
         whereby the individual craftsman very soon loses his ability to 
         pursue his <i>whole</i> handicraft, on the other hand doing his 
         detail work so much better; and thus the process is converted 
         into a division of the whole operation into its component 
         parts.  (Pp.318, 319 [336, 337]) 
 
  <p class="quote">
     (2) Or many craftsmen doing the same or similar work are united in 
         the same factory, and the individual processes, instead of 
         being performed successively by one worker, are gradually 
         separated and done simultaneously by several workers.  
         (Needles, etc.) Instead of being the work of one artificer, the 
         product is now the work of a union of artificers, each of whom 
         performs only a detail operation.  (P.319,320 [337,338]) 
 
 <p>
In both cases, their result is a productive mechanism whose organs are 
human beings.  The work retains a handicraft nature; each detail process 
through which the product goes must be performable by hand; hence, any 
really scientific analysis of the production process is excluded.  Each 
individual worker is completely chained to a detail function <i>because</i> 
of its handicraft nature.  (P.321 [338-39]) 
 
 <p>
In this way, labour is saved — as compared to the craftsman — and this 
is increased still more by transmission to succeeding generations.  
Thus, the division of labour in manufacture corresponds to the tendency 
of former societies to make a trade hereditary.  Castes, guilds.  (P.322 
[339-40]) 
 
 <p>
Subdivision of tools through adaptation to the various partial 
operations — 500 kinds of hammers in Birmingham.  (Pp.323-24 [341]) 
 
 <p>
Manufacture, considered from the standpoint of its total mechanism, has 
two aspects: either merely mechanical assembly of independent detail 
products (watch), or a series of related processes in one workshop 
(needle).  
 
 <p>
In manufacture, each group of workers supplies another with its raw 
material.  Hence, the basic condition is that each group produces a 
given quantum in a given time; thus, a continuity, regularity, 
uniformity, and intensity of labour, of quite a different kind are 
created than in co-operation proper.  Thus, here we have the technical 
law of the production process: that labour be socially necessary labour.  
(P.329 [345]) 
 
 <p>
The inequality of the time required for the individual operations makes 
it necessary that the different groups of workers be of different size 
and number (in type founding: four founders and two breakers to one 
rubber).  Thus, manufacture sets up a mathematically fixed ratio for the 
quantitative extent of the several organs of the collective worker, and 
production can be expanded only by employing an additional multiple of 
the whole group.  Moreover, only after a definite level of production 
has been reached does it pay to make certain functions independent: 
supervision, transporting the products from place to place, etc.  
(Pp.329,330 [346]) 
 
 <p>
Combination of various manufactures into a united manufacture also 
occurs — but, as yet, it always lacks real technical unity, which 
arises only with machinery.  (P.331 [347-48]) 
 
 <p>
Machines appeared in manufacture at an early date — sporadically — 
grain and stamping mills, etc., but only as something subordinate.  The 
chief machinery of manufacture is the combined collective worker, who 
possesses a much higher degree of perfection than the old individual 
craft worker, and in whom all the imperfections, such as are often 
necessarily developed in the detail worker, such as perfection.  (P.333 
[348-49]) Manufacture evolves differences among these detail workers, 
skilled and unskilled, and even a complete hierarchy of workers.  (P.334 
[349]) 
 
 <p>
Division of labour: 
 
  <p class="quote">
     (1) general — into agriculture, industry, shipping, etc.; 
 
  <p class="quote">
     (2) particular — into species and subspecies; 
 
  <p class="quote">
     (3) in detail — in the workshop. 
 
 <p>
The social division of labour also develops from different starting 
points.  
 
  <p class="quote">
     (1) Within the family and the tribe the natural division of labour 
         according to sex and age, plus slavery through violence against 
         neighbors, which extends it.  (P.335 [351-52]) 
 
  <p class="quote">
     (2) Different communities according to location, climate, level of 
         culture, turn out different products which are exchanged where 
         these communities come in contact.  (P.49 [87]) 
 
 <p>
Exchange with these foreign communities is, then, one of the chief mens 
of breaking off the natural association of the community itself through 
further development of the natural division of labour.  (P.336 [352]) 
 
 <p>
Division of labour in manufacture, thus, presupposes certain degree of 
development of the social division of labour; on the other hand, it 
develops the latter further — as in the territorial division of labour.  
(Pp.337,338 [352,353]) 
 
 <p>
For all that, there is always this difference between social division of 
labour and division of labour in manufacture — that the former produces 
commodities, whereas in the latter the detail worker does not produce 
commodities.  Hence, concentration and organization in the latter, 
scattering and disorder of competition in the former.  (Pp.339,341 
[354,356]) 
 
 <p>
Earlier organization of the Indian communities.  (Pp.341,342 [357]) The 
guild.  (Pp.343-44 [358-59]) Whereas in all these there exists division 
of labour in society, the division of labour in manufacture is a specific 
creation of the capitalist mode of production.  
 
 <p>
As in co-operation, the functioning working organism is a form of 
existence of capital in manufacture as well.  Hence, the productive 
power arising from the combination of labours appears to be the 
productive power of capital.  But, whereas co-operation leaves the 
individual's mode of working on the whole unchanged, manufacture 
revolutionizes it, cripples the worker; unable to make a product 
independently, he is now a mere appendage of the capitalist's workshop.  
The intellectual faculties of labour disappear as far as the many are 
concerned, to expand in scope for the one.  It is a result of the 
division of labour in manufacture that the labourers are brought 
face-to-face with the intellectual potencies of the labour process as the 
property of another and as a ruling power.  This process of separation 
— which begins as early as co-operation, and develops in manufacture — 
is completed in modern industry, which separates science as an 
independent productive force from labour and presses it into the service 
of capital.  (P.346 [361]) 
 
 <p>
Illustrative quotations.  (P.347 [362-63]) 
 
 <p>
Manufacture, in one aspect a definite organization of social labour, is, 
in another, only a particular method of begetting relative 
surplus-value.  (P.350 [364]) Historical significance ibidem.  
 
 <p>
Obstacles to the development of manufacture, even during its classical 
period, are limitations of the number of unskilled workers owning to the 
predominance of the skilled; limitation of the work of women and 
children owing to the men's resistance; the insistence on the laws of 
apprenticeship up to recent times, even where superfluous; continual 
insubordination of the workers, since the collective worker as yet 
possesses no framework independent of the workers; emigration of the 
workers.  (Pp.353,354 [367,368]) 
 
 <p>
Besides, manufacture itself was unable to revolutionize the whole of 
social production, or even merely to dominate it.  Its narrow technical 
basis came into conflict with the production requirement that it had 
created.  The machine became necessary, and manufacture had already 
learned how to make it.  (P.355 [368]) 
 <a id="4"></a>
<h3> 4.  MACHINERY AND MODERN INDUSTRY </h3>
<a id="4.A"></a>
<h5>A.  Machinery as Such</h5>
<p>
The revolution in the mode of production, starting in manufacture with 
labour-power, here starts with the instruments of labour.  
 
 <p>
All fully-developed machinery consists of
 
  <p class="quote">
     (1) the motor mechanism; 
 
  <p class="quote">
     (2) the transmitting mechanism; 
 
  <p class="quote">
     (3) the tool or working machine.  (P.357 [373]) 
 
 <p>
The industrial revolution of the 18th century started with the working 
machine.  What characterizes it is that the tool — in a more or less 
modified form — is transferred from man to the machine, and is worked 
by the machine under the operation of man.  At the outset, it is 
immaterial whether the motive power is human or a natural one.  The 
specific difference is that man uses only his own organs while the 
machine can, within certain limits, employ as many tools as demanded.  
(Spinning-wheel, 1 spindle; jenny, 12 to 18 spindles.) 
 
 <p>
So far, in the spinning-wheel, it is not the treadle, the power, but the 
spindle that is affected by the industrial revolution — at the 
beginning, man is still motive power and tender at the same time 
everywhere.  The revolution of the working machine, on the contrary, 
first made the perfecting of the steam-engine a necessity, and then also 
carried it out.  (Pp.359-60 [374-75]; also, pp.361-62 [376-77]) 
 
 <p>
Two kinds of machinery in modern industry: either 
 
  <p class="indentb">
     (1) co-operation of similar machines (power-loom, envelope-machine, 
         which combines the work of a number of detail workers through 
         the combination of various tools), in this case technical 
         oneness already, through the transmission and the motive power; 
         or 
 
  <p class="indentb">
     (2) machine system, combination of different detail machines 
         (spinning-mill).  
 
 <p>
The natural basis for this is the division of labour in manufacture.  
But, at once, an essential difference.  In manufacture, every detail 
process had to be adapted to the labourer; this is no longer necessary 
here — the labour process can be objectively dissected into its 
component parts, which is then left to science, or to experience based 
upon it, to be mastered by machines.  Here, the quantitative ratio of 
the several groups of workers is repeated as the ratio of the several 
groups of machines.  (Pp.363-66 [378-79]) 
 
 <p>
In both cases, the factory constitutes a big automaton (moreover, 
perfected to that shape only recently) and this is its adequate form.  
(P.367 [379]) And its most perfect form is the machine-building 
automaton, which abolished the handicraft and manufacture foundation of 
large-scale industry, and thus first provided the consummate form of 
machinery.  (P.369-72 [384-86]) 
 
 <p>
Connection between the revolutionizing of the various branches, up to 
the means of communication.  (P.371 [383]) 
 
 <p>
In manufacture, the combination of workers is subjective.  Here, there 
is an objective mechanical production organism, which the worker finds 
ready at hand, and which can function only through collective labour: the 
co-operative character of the labour process is now a technical 
necessity.  (P.372 [386]) 
 
 <p>
The productive forces arising from co-operation and the division of 
labour cost capital nothing; the natural forces: steam, water, also cost 
nothing.  Neither do the forces discovered by science.  But, the latter 
can be realized only with suitable apparatus, which can be constructed 
only at great expense; likewise, the working machines cost much more 
than the old tools.  But, these machines have a much longer life and a 
much greater field of production than the tool; they, therefore, 
transfer a much smaller portion of value, comparatively, to the product 
than a tool — and, hence, the gratuitous service performed by the 
machine (which does not reappear in the value of the product) is much 
greater than in the case of the tool.  (Pp.374,375,376 [387,388,390]) 
 
 <p>
Reduction in cost through concentration of production is much greater in 
modern industry than in manufacture.  (P.375 [388]) 
 
 <p>
The prices of finished goods prove how much the machine has cheapened 
production, and that the portion of value due to the instruments of 
labour grows relatively, but declines absolutely.  The productivity of 
the machine is measured by the extent to which it replaces human 
labour-power.  Examples (pp.377-79 [390-92]) 
 
 <p>
Assumed a steam plough takes the place of 150 workers getting and annual 
wage of 3,000 pounds, this annual wage does <i>not</i> represent all the 
labour performed by them, but only the necessary labour-power, they also 
perform surplus-labour, in addition.  If the steam plough costs 3,000 
pounds, however, that is the expression in money of <i>all</i> the labour 
embodied in it.  Thus, if the machine costs as much as the labour-power 
it replaces, the human labour embodied in it is always much less than 
that which it replaces.  (P.380 [392]) 
 
 <p>
As a means of cheapening production, the machine must cost less labour 
than it replaces.  But, for capital, its value must be less than that of 
the labour-power supplanted by it.  Therefore, machines that do not pay 
in England may pay in America — e.g., for stonebreaking.  Hence, as a 
result of certain legal restrictions, machines that formerly did not pay 
for capital may suddenly make their appearance.  (Pp.380-81 [393-94])

<h5>B.  Appropriation of labour-Power Through Machinery</h5>
<p>
Since machinery itself contains the power-driving it, muscular power 
drops in value.  labour of women and children; immediate increase in the 
number of wage-labourers through the enrolling of members of the family 
who had not previously worked for wages.  Thus, the value of the man's 
labour-power is spread over the labour-power of the whole family — i.e., 
depreciated.  Now, four persons instead of one must perform not only 
labour, but also surplus-labour for capital that one family may live.  
Thus, the degree of exploitation is increased together with the material 
exploitation.  (P.383 [395]) 
 
 <p>
Formerly, the sale and purchase of labour-power was a relation between 
free persons; now, minors or children are bought; the workers now sells 
wife and child — he becomes a slave-dealer.  Examples (pp.384-85 
[396-97]) 
 
 <p>
Moral degradation.  (P.389 [399]) Educational clauses and manufacturers' 
resistance to them.  (P.390 [399-400]) 
 
 <p>
The entrance of women and children into the factory finally breaks down 
the male worker's resistance to the despotism of capital.  
 
 <p>
If machinery shortens the labour-time necessary to produce an object, in 
the hands of capital it becomes the most powerful weapon for lengthening 
the working-day far beyond its normal bounds.  It creates, on the one 
hand, new conditions that enable capital to do so, and, on the other, 
new motives for so doing.  
 
 <p>
Machinery is capable of perpetual motion, and limited only by the 
weakness and limitation of the assisting human labour-power.  The machine 
that is worn out in 7.5 years, working 20 hours daily, absorbs just as 
much surplus-labour for the capitalist, but in half the time, as another 
that is worn out in 15 years working 10 hours daily.  (P.393 [404]) 
 
 <p>
The moral depreciation of the machine — by superseding — is in this 
way risked still less.  (P.394 [404-05]) 
 
 <p>
Moreover, a large quantity of labour is absorbed without increasing the 
investments in buildings and machines; thus, not only does surplus-value 
grow with a lengthened working-day, but the outlay required to obtain it 
diminishes relatively.  This is more important insofar as the proportion 
of fixed capital greatly predominated — as is the case in large-scale 
industry.  (P.395 [405]) 
 
 <p>
During the first period of machinery, when it possesses a monopoly 
character, profits are enormous — and, hence, the thirst for more, for 
boundless lengthening of the working-day.  With the general introduction 
of machinery, this monopoly profit vanishes, and the law asserts itself 
that surplus-value arises, not from the labour supplanted by the machine, 
but from the labour employed by it — that is, from the variable capital.  
But, under machine production, the latter is necessarily reduced by the 
large outlays.  Thus, there is an inherent contradiction in the 
capitalist employment of machinery: for a given mass of capital, it 
increases one factor of surplus-value, its rate, by reducing the other, 
the number of workers.  As soon as the value of a machine-made commodity 
becomes the regulating social value of that commodity, this 
contradiction comes to light, and again drives towards lengthening the 
working-day.  (P.397 [407]) 
 
 <p>
But, at the same time, machinery — by setting free supplanted workers, 
as well as by enrolling women and children — produces a surplus working 
population, which must let capital dictate the law to it.  Hence, 
machinery overthrows all the moral and natural bounds of the 
working-day.  Hence, the paradox that the most powerful means of 
shortening labour-time is the most infallible means of converting the 
whole lifetime of the worker and his family into available labour-time 
for expanding the value of capital.  (P.398 [408]) 
 
 <p>
We have already seen how the social reaction occurs here through the 
fixing of the normal working-day; on this basis, there now develops the 
intensification of labour.  (P.399 [409]) 
 
 <p>
At the beginning, with the speeding-up of the machine, the intensity of 
labour increases simultaneously with the lengthening of labour-time.  But, 
soon the point is reached where the two exclude each other.  It is 
different, however, when labour-time is restricted.  Intensity can only 
grow; in 10 hours, as much work can be done as ordinarily in 12 or more, 
and now the more intensive working-day counts as raised to a higher 
power, and labour is measured not merely by its time, but by its 
intensity.  (P.400 [409]) Thus, in 5 hours of necessary and 5 hours of 
surplus-labour, the same surplus-value can be attained as in 6 hours of 
necessary and 6 hours of surplus-labour at lower intensity.  (P.400 
[410]) 
 
 <p>
<i>How</i> is labour intensified? In manufacture, it has been proved (Note 
159, p.401 [411, footernote 1]), pottery, for instance, etc., that mere 
shortening of the working-day is sufficient to raise productivity 
enormously.  In machine labour, this was far more doubtful.  But, R.  
Gardner's proof.  (Pp.401-02 [411-12]) 
 
 <p>
As soon as the shortened working-day becomes law, the machine becomes a 
means of squeezing more intensive labour out of the worker, either by 
greater speed or fewer hands in relation to machine.  Examples.  
(Pp.403-07 [412-16]) Evidence that enrichment and expansion of the 
factory grew simultaneously therewith.  (Pp.407-09 [416-18]) 

<a id="4.C"></a>
<h5>C.  The Whole Factory in Its Classical Form </h5>
<p>
In the factory, the machine takes care of the proper manipulation of the 
tool; thus, the qualitative differences of labour developed in 
manufacture are here abolished; labour is levelled-out more and more; at 
most, difference in age and sex.  The division of labour is here a 
distribution of workers among the specialized machines.  Here, division 
is only between principal workers, who are really employed at the tool, 
and feeders (this is true only for the self-acting mule, scarcely so for 
the throttle, and still less for the corrected power loom), in addition 
supervisors, engineers and stockers, mechanics, joiners, etc., a class 
only outwardly aggregated to the factory.  (Pp.411-12 [420]) 
 
 <p>
The necessity for adapting the worker to the continuous motion of an 
automaton requires training from childhood, but by no means that a 
worker be any longer chained to one detail function all his life, as in 
manufacture.  Change of personnel can take place at the same machine 
(relay system), and because of the slight effort required to learn, the 
workers can be shifted from one kind of machine to another.  The work of 
the attendants is either very simple or is taken over more and more by 
the machine.  None the less, at the beginning, manufacture division of 
labour persists traditionally, and itself becomes a greater weapon for 
exploitation by capital.  The worker becomes a lifelong part of a detail 
machine.  (P.413 [422-23]) 
 
 <p>
All capitalist production, insofar as it is not only a labour process but 
also a process for expanding the value of capital, has this in common 
that it is not the worker who employs the instruments of labour, but vice 
versa — the instruments of labour employ the worker; but only through 
machinery does this perversion acquire technical, palpable reality.  
Through its conversion into an automaton, the instrument of labour itself 
confronts the labourer, during the labour process, as capital, as dead 
labour that dominates and sucks dry the living labour-power.  Ditto the 
intellectual powers of the production process as the power of capital 
over labour....  The detail skill of the individual, pumped-out machine 
operator vanishes as a tiny secondary thing alongside science, the 
tremendous natural forces and social mass labour which are embodied in 
the machine system.  (Pp.414,415 [423]) 
 
 <p>
Barracks-like discipline of the factory, factory code.  (P.416 [423-24]) 
 
 <p>
Material conditions of the factory.  (Pp.417-18 [425-27]) 
<a id="4.D"></a>
<h5>D.  The Workers' Struggle  <br>
               Against the Factory System and Machinery </h5>
<p>
This struggle, existing since the origin of the capitalist relationship, 
first occurs here as a revolt against the machine as the material basis 
of the capitalist mode of production.  Ribbon looms.  (P.419 [427-28]) 
Luddites.  (P.420 [428-29]) Only later do the workers distinguish 
between the material means of production and the social form of their 
exploitation.  
 
 <p>
In manufacture, the improved division of labour was rather a means of 
virtually replacing the labourers.  (P.421 [429]) (Digression on 
agriculture, displacement p.422 [430].) But, in machinery, the worker is 
actually displaced; the machine competes with him directly.  Hand-loom 
weavers.  (P.423 [431]) Likewise India.  (P.424 [432]) This effect is 
permanent, since machinery continually seizes upon new fields of 
production.  The self-dependent and estranged form that capitalist 
production gives the instrument of labour, as against the labourer, is 
developed by machinery into a thorough antagonism — hence, now the 
labourer's revolt first against the instrument of labour.  (P.424 [432]) 
 
 <p>
Details of the displacement of workers by machines.  (Pp.425,426 
[433,435]) The machine as a means of breaking the workers' resistance to 
capital by displacing them.  (Pp.427,428 [435-37]) 
 
 <p>
Liberal economics maintains that the machine, displacing workers, at the 
same time releases capital that can employ these workers.  On the 
contrary, however, every introduction of machines locks up capital, 
diminishes its variable and increases its constant components; it can, 
therefore, merely restrict capital's capacity for employment.  In fact 
— and this is what these apologists also mean — in this manner, not 
capital is set free; but the means of subsistence of the displaced 
workers are set free; the workers are cut off from the means of 
subsistence, which the apologist expresses by saying that the machine 
liberates means of subsistence for the workers.  (Pp.429-30 [438-39]) 
 
 <p>
This further development (very good for Fortnightly [the magazine for 
which this synopsis was ostensibly written]) (pp.431.431-32 [439-41]): 
the antagonism inseparable from the capitalist employment of machinery 
do not exist for the apologists, because they do not arise out of 
machinery as such, but out of its capitalist employment.  (P.432 [441]) 
 
 <p>
Expansion of production by machines directly and indirectly, and thus 
possible increase in number of workers hitherto employed: miners, slaves 
in cotton states, etc.  On the other hand, displacement of Scotch and 
Irish by sheep to suit the requirements of the woollen factories.  
(Pp.433,434 [443,444]) 
 
 <p>
Machine production carries the social division of labour much further 
than manufacture did.  (P.435 [444]) 
 

<a id="4.E"></a>
<h5>E.  Machinery and Surplus-Value</h5>
<p>
The first result of machinery: increasing surplus-value together with 
the mass of products in which it is embodied and on which the capitalist 
class and its hangers-on live, thus increasing the number of 
capitalists; new luxury wants, together with the means of satisfying 
them.  Luxury production grows.  Likewise, means of communication 
(which, however, absorb only little labour-power in the more developed 
countries) (evidence p.436 [445]) — finally, the servant class grows, 
the modern domestic slaves, whose material is supplied by the releasing 
[of workers].  (P.437 [446]) Statistics.  
 
 <p>
Economic contradictions.  (P.437 [446]) 
 
 <p>
Possibility of absolute increase in the mass of labour in one branch of 
business owning to machines, and the modalities of this process.  
(Pp.439-40 [449]) 
 
 <p>
Enormous elasticity, capacity for sudden extension of large-scale 
industry to a high degree of development.  (P.441 [450-51]) Reaction 
upon the countries producing raw materials.  Emigration owing to release 
of workers.  International division of labour of the industrial and 
agricultural countries — periodicity of crises and prosperity.  (P.442 
[451]) Workers thrown back and forth in this process of expansion.  
(P.444 [454]) 
 
 <p>
Historical data on this.  (Pp.445-49 [455-59]) 
 
 <p>
Displacement of co-operation and manufacture by machinery (and the 
intermediate stages, pp.450-51 [459-60]) Also, displacement of 
establishments not run on factory lines, industry branches in the spirit 
of large-scale industry — domestic industry, an outside department of 
the factory.  (P.452 [461]) In home industry and modern manufacture, 
exploitation still more shameless than in the factory proper.  (P.453 
[462]) Examples: London print-shops (p.453 [462-63]), book-binding, 
rag-sorting (p.454 [463]), brick-making (p.455 [462-63]).  Domestic 
industry: lace-making (pp.457-59 [466-68]), straw plaiting (p.460 
[468-69]).  Conversion into factory production with achievement of 
ultimate limit of exploitability: wearing apparel by the sewing-machine 
(pp.462-66 [470-74]).  Speeding-up of this conversion by extension of 
the compulsory Factory Acts, which put an end to the old routine based 
upon unlimited exploitation.  (P.466 [475]) Examples: pottery (p.467 
[475-76]), lucifer matches (pp.468 [476]).  Furthermore, effect of the 
Factory Acts upon irregular work, owing to the workers' habits, as well 
as to seasons and fashions.  (P.470 [478]) Overwork alongside idleness, 
owing to the seasons, in domestic industry and manufacture.  (P.471 
[478-79]) 
 
 <p>
Sanitary clauses of the Factory Acts.  (P.473 [480-81]) Educational 
clauses.  (P.475 [482-83]) 
 
 <p>
Discharge of workers merely because of age, as soon as they are grown up 
and no longer fitted for the work, and can no longer live on a child's 
wages, while at the same time, they have learned no new trade.  (P.477 
[484-85]) 
 
 <p>
Dissolution of the mysteries, and of the traditional ossification of 
manufacture and handicraft, by modern industry, which converts the 
production process into a conscious application of natural forces.  
Hence, it alone is revolutionary, as against all earlier forms.  )P.479 
[486-87]) But as a capitalist form, it lets the ossified division of 
labour persist for the worker, and since it daily revolutionizes the 
former's basis, it ruins the worker.  On the other hand, in this very 
thing, in this necessary change of activities of one and the same worker 
lies the requirement of his being as versatile as possible and the 
possibilities of the social revolution.  (Pp.480-81 [487-88]) 
 
 <p>
Need for extending factory legislation to all branches not operated on 
factory lines.  (P.482 ff.  [489-ff.]) Act of 1867.  (P.485 [493]) 
Mines, note.  (P.486 ff.  [495-503]) 
 
 <p>
Concentrating effect of the Factory Acts; generalization of factory 
production and thus of the classical form of capitalist production; 
accentuation of its inherent contradictions, maturing of the elements 
for overturning the old society, and of the elements for forming the 
new.  (Pp.488-93 [498-503]) 
 
 <p>
Agriculture.  Here the release of the workers by machines is even more 
acute.  Replacement of the peasant by the wage-labourer.  Destruction of 
rural domestic manufacture.  Accentuation of the antithesis between town 
and country.  Dispersion and weakening of the rural labourers, whereas 
the urban workers are reduced down to a minimum.  At the same time 
robbing the soil: the acme of the capitalist mode of production is the 
undermining of the sources of all wealth: the soil and the labourer.

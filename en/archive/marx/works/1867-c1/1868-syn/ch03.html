<h3>1.  THE LABOR PROCESS AND THE PROCESS<br> OF PRODUCING SURPLUS-VALUE </h3>
<p>
The purchaser of labor-power consumes it by setting its seller to work.  
This labor-to-produce-commodities at first turns out use-values, and in 
this property it is independent of the specific relation between 
capitalist and labourer....  Description of the labor process as such.  
(Pp.141-49 [177-85]) 
</p>
<p>
The labor process, on a capitalist basis, has two peculiarities: 
 
<p class="quote">
     (1) The labourer works under the capitalist's control. 
 
<p class="quote">
     (2) The product is the capitalist's property, since the labor 
         process is now only a process between two <i>things</i> purchased by 
         the capitalist: labor-power and means of production.   
         (P.150 [184-85]) 
 </p>
<p>
But the capitalist does not want the use-value produced <i>for its own 
sake</i>, but only as the depository of <i>exchange-value</i>, and especially of 
surplus-value.  Labor, under this condition — where the commodity was a 
unity of use-value and exchange-value — becomes the unity of the 
production process and of the process creating value.  (P.151 [186]) 
 </p>
<p>
Thus, the quantity of labor embodied in the product is to be 
investigated.  
 </p>
<p>
Yarn, for example.  Let 10 lbs.  of cotton be necessary for making it, 
say, 10 shillings, and instruments of labor — whose wear and tear are 
inevitable in the spinning, here denoted in brief as spindle share — 
say, 2 shilling.  Thus, there are 12 shillings' worth of means of 
production in the product — i.e., inasmuch as 
 
<p class="quote">
     (1) the product has become an actual use-value, in this case yarn; 
         and 
 
<p class="quote">
     (2) only the socially necessary labor-time was represented in these 
         instruments of labor.   
 </p>
<p>
How much is added to it by the labor of spinning? 
 </p>
<p>
The labor process is here viewed from an altogether different angle.  In 
the value of the product, the labors of the cotton-planter, of the 
spindle-maker, etc., and of the spinner, are commensurable, 
qualitatively equal parts of general, human, necessary value-creating 
labor, and therefore distinguishable only qualitatively, and for that 
very reason quantitatively comparable by the length of time, 
presupposing that it is socially necessary labor-time, for only the 
latter is value-creating.  
 </p>
<p>
Assumed the value of a day's labor-power is 3 shillings, and that it 
represents 6 hours of labor, that 1 2/3 lbs.  of yarn are made per hour, 
hence in 6 hours: 10 lbs.  of yarn from 10 lbs.  of cotton (as above); 
then 3 shillings of value have been added in 6 hours, and the value of 
the product is 15 shillings (10 + 2 + 3 shillings), or a shilling and a 
half per pound of yarn.  
 </p>
<p>
But in this case there is no surplus-value.  That is of no use to the 
capitalist.  (Vulgar-economic humbug, p.157 [190]) 
 </p>
<p>
We assumed that the value of a day's labor-power was 3 shillings, 
because 1/2 working-day, or 6 hours, is incorporated in it.  But the 
fact that only 1/2 working-day is required to maintain the worker for 24 
hours does not in any way prevent him from working a whole day.  The 
value of labor-power, and the value it creates, are two different 
quantities.  Its useful property was only a conditio sine qua non; but 
what was decisive was the specific use-value of labor-power in being the 
source of more exchange-value than it has itself.  (P.159 [193]) 
 </p>
<p>
Hence, the labourer works 12 hours, spins 20 lbs.  of cotton worth 20 
shillings and 4 shillings' worth of spindles, and his labor costs 3 
shillings: total — 27 shillings.  But, in the product there are 
embodied: four days' labor in the shape of spindles and cotton, and one 
day's labor of the spinner, in all five days at 6 shillings totalling 30 
shillings' value of product.  We have a surplus-value of 3 shillings: 
money has been converted into capital.  (P.160 [194]) All the conditions 
of the problem are fulfilled.  (Detail p.160 [194]) 
 </p>
<p>
As a value-creating process, the labor process becomes a process of 
producing surplus-value the moment it is prolonged beyond the point 
where it delivers a simple equivalent for the paid-for value of 
labor-power.  
</p>
<p>
The value-creating process differs from the simple labor process in that 
the latter is considered <i>qualitatively</i>, and only to the extent that it 
comprises socially necessary labor-time.  (P.161 [195], details p.162 
[196]) 
 </p>
<p>
As the unity of labor process and value-creating process, the production 
process is the production of commodities; as the unity of labor process 
and the process of producing surplus-value, it is the process of 
capitalist production of commodities.  (P.163 [197]) 
 </p>
<p>
Reduction of compound labor to simple labor.  (Pp.163-65 [197-98]) 
 <a id="2"></a>
<h3>2.  CONSTANT AND VARIABLE CAPITAL</h3>
<p>
The labor process adds <i>new</i> value to the object of labor — but, at the 
same time, it <i>transfers</i> the value of the object of labor to the 
product, thus <i>preserving</i> it by merely adding new value.  This double 
result is attained in this manner: the specifically useful qualitative 
character of labor converts one use-value into another use-value and 
thus preserves value; the value-creating, abstractly general, 
quantitative character of labor, however, adds value.  (P.166 [199]) 
 
 <p>
E.g.  — let the productivity of spinning labor multiply sixfold.  As 
useful (qualitative) labor, it preserves in the same time six-times as 
many instruments of labor.  But it adds only the same new value as 
before — i.e., in each pound of yarn, there is only 1/6 of the new 
value previously added.  As value-creating labor, it accomplishes no 
more than before.  (P.167 [201]) The contrary is true, if the 
productivity of spinning labor remains the same, but the value of the 
instruments of labor rises.  (P.168 [201]) 
 
 <p>
The instruments of labor transfer to the product only that value which 
they lose themselves.  (P.169 [203]) This is the case in differing 
degree.  Coal, lubricants, etc., are consumed completely — raw 
materials take on a new form.  Instruments, machinery, etc., transmit 
value only slowly and by parts — and the wear and tear are calculated 
by experience.  (Pp.169-70 [203]) But the instrument remains continually 
as a whole in the labor process.  Therefore, the same instrument counts 
as a whole in the labor process, but only partly in the process of 
producing surplus-value, so that the difference between the two 
processes is reflected here in material factors.  (P.171 [204]) 
Conversely, the raw material, which forms waste, enters wholly into the 
process of producing surplus-value, and only partly into the labor 
process, since it appears in the product minus the waste.  (P.171 [205]) 
 
 <p>
But, in no case can an instrument of labor transfer <i>more</i> 
exchange-value than it possessed itself — in the labor process it acts 
only as a use-value and, hence, can give only the exchange-value that it 
possessed previously.  (P.172 [205-06]) 
 
 <p>
This preserving of value is very advantageous to the capitalist, but 
costs him nothing.  (P.173,174 [205,207]) 
 
 <p>
Yet, the preserved value only re-appears, it was already present, and 
only the labor process adds new value.  That is, in capitalist 
production, surplus-value, the excess of the product's value over the 
value of the consumed elements of the product (means of production and 
labor-power).  (Pp.175,176 [208]) 
 
 <p>
Herewith have been described the forms of existence which the original 
capital value takes on in dropping its money-form, in being converted 
into factors of the labor process: 
 
 <p class="quote">
     (1) in the purchase of instruments of labor; 
  <p class="quote">
     (2) in the purchase of labor-power. 
  <p>
The capital invested in instruments of labor does <i>not</i>, therefore, 
alter the magnitude of its value in the production process.  We call it 
CONSTANT capital.  
  <p>
The portion invested in labor-power <i>does</i> change its value; it 
produces: 
 <p class="quote">
     (1) its own value, and 
  <p class="quote">
     (2) surplus-value — it is called VARIABLE capital.   
         (P.176 [209]) 
 
 <p>
Capital is constant only in relation to the production process 
specifically given, in which it does not change; it can consist 
sometimes of more, sometimes of fewer instruments of labor, and the 
purchased instruments of labor may rise or fall in value, but that does 
not affect their relationship to the production process.  (P.177 
[210-11]) Likewise, the percentage in which a given capital is 
subdivided into constant and variable capital may change, but in any 
given case, the c remains constant and the v variable.  (P.178 [211]) 
  <a id="3"></a>
<h3>3.  THE RATE OF SURPLUS-VALUE</h3>

<td align="CENTER">410</td>

<td align="CENTER">90</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
At the end of the labor process in which v is turned into labor-power, 
we get 410c + 90v + 90s = 590.  
 
 <p>
Let us assume c consists of 312 raw material, 44 auxiliary material, and 
54 wear and tear of machinery — in all 410.  
 
 <p>
Let the value of <i>all</i> the machinery be 1,054.  
 
  <p>
If this were entered as a <i>whole</i>, we would get 1,410 for c on both 
sides of our calculation; the surplus-value would remain 90 as before.  
(P.179 [212]) 
 
   <p>
Since the value of c merely re-appears in the product, the value of the 
product we get differs from the value created in the process; the 
latter, therefore, equals not c + v + s, but v + s.  Hence, the 
magnitude of c is immaterial to the process of creating surplus-value — 
i.e., c = 0.  (P.180 [213]) This also takes place in practice in 
commercial accounting — e.g., in calculating a country's profit from 
its industry, imported raw material is deducted.  (P.181 [215]) Cf.  
Vol.III for the ratio of surplus-value to total capital.  
 
   <p>
Hence: the rate of surplus-value is s:v, in the above case 90:90 = 100%.  
   <p>
The labor-time during which the labourer reproduces the value of his 
labor-power — in capitalist or other circumstances — is the NECESSARY 
LABOR; what goes beyond that, producing surplus-value for the 
capitalist, SURPLUS-LABOR.  (Pp.183,184 [215,217]) Surplus-value is 
congealed surplus-labor, and only the <i>form of extorting</i> the same 
differentiates the various social formations.  
   <p>
Example of the incorrectness of including c — pp.185-96 [217-29] 
(Senior) 
   <p>
The sum of the necessary labor and the surplus-labor equals the 
working-day.  
 
 
 
   <a id="4"></a>
<h3>4.  THE WORKING-DAY</h3>
<p>
The necessary labor-time is given.  The surplus-labor is variable — but 
within certain limits.  It can never be reduced to nil, since then 
capitalist production ceases.  It can never go as high as 24 hours for 
physical reasons, and, moreover, the maximum limit is always affected by 
moral grounds as well.  But, these limits are very elastic.  The 
economic demand is that the working-day should be no longer than for 
normal wear-and-tear of the worker.  But what is normal? An antinomy 
results and only force can decide.  Hence, the struggle between the 
working class and the capitalist class for the normal working-day.  
(Pp.198-202 [231-35]) 
 
 <p>
Surplus-labor in previous social epochs.  As long as the exchange-value 
is not more important than the use-value, surplus-labor is milder — 
e.g., among the ancients; only where direct exchange-value — gold and 
silver — was produced, surplus-labor was terrible.  (P.203 [235]) 
Likewise, in the slave states of America until the mass production of 
cotton for export.  Likewise, corvee labor — e.g., in Rumania.  
 
 <p>
Corvee labor is the best means of comparison with capitalist 
exploitation, because the former fixes and shows the surplus-labor as a 
specific labor-time to be performed — Reglement organique of Wallachia.  
(Pp.204-06 [235-36]) 
 
 <p>
The English Factory Acts are negative expression of the greed for 
surplus-labor, just as the foregoing was its positive expression.  
 
 <p>
THE FACTORY ACTS.  That of 1850 — (p.207 [239]).  10.5 hours and 7.5 on 
Saturdays = 60 hours per week.  Mill-owners' profit through evasion.  
(Pp.208-11 [240-43]) 
 
 <p>
Exploitation in unrestricted, or only later-restricted, branches: 
 
 <p class="index">
     — lace industry     (p.212 [243]) <br>
     — potteries         (p.213 [244]) <br>
     — lucifer matches   (p.214 [246]) <br>
     — wall-paper        (pp.214-17 [246-48])<br> 
     — baking            (pp.217-22 [248-51]) <br>
     — railway employees (p.223 [253]) <br>
     — seamstresses      (pp.223-25 [254-56]) <br>
     — blacksmiths       (p.226 [256]) <br>
     — day and night workers in shifts:  <br>
        (a) metallurgy and the metal industry  <br>
                          (pp.227-35 [256-63]) <br>
<p>
These facts prove that capital regards the labourer as nothing else than 
labor-power, all of whose time is labor-time as far as this is at all 
possible at a given moment, and that the length of life of labor-power 
is immaterial to the capitalists.  (Pp.236-38 [264-65]) But is this not 
against the interests of the capitalist? What about the replacement of 
what is rapidly worn out? The organized slave trade in the interior of 
the United States has raised the rapid wearing out of slaves to an 
economic principle, exactly like the supply of labourers from the rural 
districts in Europe, etc.  (P.239 [267]) Poorhouse supply (labor-power 
provided by poorhouses).  (P.240 [267]) The capitalist sees only the 
continuously available surplus-population and wears it out.  Whether the 
race perishes — apres moi le deluge.  Capital is reckless of the health 
or length of life of the labourer, unless under compulsion from 
society...  and free competition brings out the inherent laws of 
capitalist production in the shape of external coercive laws having 
power over every individual capitalist.  (P.243 [270]) 
 
 <p>
Establishment of a normal working-day — the result of centuries of 
struggle between capitalist and labourer.  
 
 <p>
At the beginning, laws were made to <i>raise</i> working-time; now to lower 
it.  (P.244 [271]) 
 
<ul class="disc">
<li>
    The first Statute of labourers, 23rd Edward III, 1349, was passed 
        under the pretext that the plague had so decimated the 
        population that everyone had to do more work.  Hence, maximum 
        wages and limit of the working-day were fixed by law. </li>
<li>
     In 1496, under Henry VII, the working day of field labourers and 
        all artificers continued from 5 a.m.  to between 7 and 8 p.m.  
        in summer — March to September — with 1 hour, 1.5 hours and 
        .5 hour, in all 3 hours' break.  In winter, it was from 5 a.m.  
        to dark.  This statute was never strictly enforced. </li>
<li> 
   In the 18th century, the <i>whole</i> week's labor was not yet 
        available to capital (with the exception of agricultural labor).  
        Cf.  controversies of that time.  (Pp.248-51 [274-77]) </li>
</ul>
<p>
Only with modern large-scale industry was this, and more, achieved; it 
broke down <i>all</i> bounds and exploited the workers most shamelessly.  The 
proletariat resisted as soon as it recollected itself.  
 
 <p class="quote">
    The five acts of 1802-33 were only nominal, since there were no 
        inspectors.  Only the Act of 18833 created a normal working-day 
        in the four textile industries: from 5:30 a.m.  to 8:30 p.m., 
        during which time young persons from 13 to 18 years of age could 
        be employed only 12 hours with 1.5 hours' pauses, children 
        from 9 to 13 years of age only 8 hours, while night work of 
        children and juveniles was prohibited.  (Pp.253-55 [278-80]) 
 
 <p>
The relay system and its abuse for purposes of evasion.  (P.256 [281]) 
 
 
<ul class="disc">
<li> Finally, the Act of 1844 — which put women of all ages on the 
        same basis as juveniles.  Children limited to 6.5 hours; the 
        relay system curbed.  On the other hand, children permitted from 
        8 years on.  </li>
<li>
At last, in 1847, the tens-hours bill forced through for women 
        and juveniles.  (P.259 [283]) The capitalists' efforts against 
        it.  (Pp.260-68 [283-92]) A flaw in the Act of 1847 led to </li>
<li> 
the compromise Act of 1850 (p.269 [292]), which fixes the 
        working day for juveniles and women — 5 days of 10.5 hours,  
        1 day of 7.5 = 60 hours per week, and that between 6 a.m.  and  
        6 p.m.  Otherwise, Act of 1847 in force for children.  The 
        exception for the silk industry.  (Cf.  p.270 [293]) </li>
<li>
In 1853, the working-time for children also limited to between  
        6 a.m.  and 6 p.m.  (P.272 [294]) </li>
<li>
Printworks Act, in 1845, limits almost nothing — children and 
        women can work 16 hours! </li>
<li>
Bleaching and dyeing works, 1860. </li>
<li>
Lace factories, 1861. </li>
<li> 
potteries and many other branches, 1863 (under the Factory Act, 
        special acts passed the same year for bleaching in the open air 
        and baking).  (P.274 [296-97]) </li>
</ul>
<p>
Large-scale industry, thus, at first creates the need for limiting 
working-time, but it later found that the same overwork has gradually 
taken possession of all other branches as well.  (P.277 [298] 
 
 <p>
History further shows that the isolated "free" labourer is defenceless 
against the capitalist and succumbs, especially with the introduction of 
women's and children's labor, so that it is here that the class struggle 
develops between the workers and the capitalists.  (P.278 [299]) 
 
 <p>
In France, the 12-hour day law for all ages and branches of work was 
passed only in 1846, (Cf., however, p.253 [278], footernote on the French 
child labor law of 1841, which was really enforced only in 1853, and 
only in the Department du Nord.) Complete "freedom of labour" in Belgium.  
The 8-hour movement in America.  (P.279 [301]) 
 
 <p>
Thus, the labourer comes out of the production process quite different 
than he entered.  The labour contract was not the act of a free agent; 
the time for which he is free to sell his labour-power is the time for 
which he is <i>forced</i> to sell it, and only the mass opposition of the 
workers wins for them the passing of a law that shall prevent the 
workers from selling, by voluntary contract with capital, themselves and 
their generation into slavery and death.  In place of the pompous 
catalogue of the inalienable rights of man, comes the modest Magna 
Charta of the Factory Act.  (Pp.280,281 [302]) 
 
    <a id="5"></a>
<h3>5.  RATE AND MASS OF SURPLUS-VALUE</h3>
<p>
With the rate, the <i>mass</i> is also given.  If the daily value of one 
labour-power is 3 shillings, and the rate of surplus-value is 100 per 
cent, its daily mass = 3 shillings, for one labourer.  
 
 <p class="QUOTE">
  I.  Since the variable capital is the money expression of the value 
      of all the labour-powers simultaneously employed by one 
      capitalist, the mass of the surplus-value produced by them is 
      equal to the variable capital multiplied by the rate of 
      surplus-value.  Both factors can vary, different combinations thus 
      arising.  The <i>mass</i> of surplus-value can grow, even with 
      decreasing variable capital, if the rate rises — that is, if the 
      working-day is lengthened.  (P.282 [303-05]) 
 
  <p class="QUOTE">
  II. This increase in the rate of surplus-value has its absolute limit 
      in that the working-day can never be prolonged to the full 
      24 hours; hence, the total value of one worker's daily production 
      can never equal the value of 24 working-hours.  Thus, in order to 
      obtain the <i>same</i> mass of surplus-value, variable capital can be 
      replaced by increased exploitation of labour only within these 
      limits.  This is important for the explanation of various 
      phenomena arising from the contradictory tendency of capital: 
 
 <p class="INDEX">
      (1) to <i>reduce</i> the variable capital and the number of workers 
          employed; and 
          
  <p class="INDEX">
      (2) to produce the greatest possible mass of surplus-value 
          nonetheless. (Pp.283,284 [305-06]) 
          
   <p class="QUOTE">
 III. The masses of value and surplus-value produced by different 
      capitals, for given value and equally high degree of exploitation 
      of labour-power, are related directly as the magnitudes of the 
      variable components of these capitals.  (P.285 [306-07]) 
 
  <p>
This seems to contradict all facts. 
 
  <p>
For a given society, and a given working-day, surplus-value can be 
increased only by increasing the number of workers — i.e., the 
population; with a given number of workers, only by lengthening the 
working-day.  This is important, however, only for <i>absolute</i> 
surplus-value.  
 
  <p>
It now turns out that not <i>every</i> sum of money can be transformed into 
capital — that a minimum exists: the cost price of a single labour-power 
and of the necessary instruments of labour.  In order to be able to live 
like a worker, the capitalist would have to have two workers, with a 
rate of surplus-value of 50 per cent, and yet save nothing.  Even with 
eight, he is still a small master.  Hence, in the Middle Ages people 
were forcibly hampered in transformation from craftsmen into capitalists 
by limitation of the number of journeymen to be employed by one master.  
The minimum of wealth required to form a real capitalist varies in 
different periods and branches of business.  (P.288 [309]) 
 
  <p>
Capital has evolved into command over labour, and sees to it that work is 
done regularly and intensively.  Moreover, it compels the workers to do 
more work than is necessary for their sustenance; and, in pumping out 
surplus-labour, it surpasses all earlier production systems based upon 
direct compulsory labour.

Capital takes over labour with the given technical conditions, and at 
first does not change them.  Hence, with the production process 
considered as a labour process, the worker stands in relation to the 
means of production not as to capital, but as to the means of his own 
intelligent activity.  But, considered as a process of creating 
surplus-value, otherwise.  The means of production become means of 
absorbing the labour of others.  It is no longer the labourer who employs 
the means of production, but the means of production that employ the 
labourer.  (P.289 [310]) Instead of being consumed by him...  they 
consume him, as the ferment necessary to their own life-process, and the 
life-process of capital consists only in its movement as value 
constantly multiplying itself....  The simple transformation of money 
into means of production transforms the latter into a title and a right 
to the labour and surplus-labour of others.

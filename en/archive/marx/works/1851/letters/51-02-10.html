<h4> [London,] 10 February 1851, 28 Dean Street, Soho</h4>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>When you wrote saying that it would soon be time to attack Louis Blanc, you were a <i>clairvoyant</i>, to say the least.</p>
<p>Now hearken to the following story:</p>
<p>A few days or perhaps a week ago, I ran into Landolphe and from the embarrassed way in which he greeted me and my wife, noted that there was something ‘rotten’ in the state of our <i>ami chevaleresque</i> <span class="context">[chivalrous friend]</span> our Bayard of the Montagne. <i>Eh bien!  Landolphe and Louis Blanc </i>have joined up with the <i>Willich-Schapper</i> committee, from which Mr Adam has resigned! And only a fortnight previously Landolphe had been raving and ranting about Barthélemy and I had been telling him about the affair of Messrs Willich and Schapper. <i>Qu'en dis-tu?</i> Not a word from these worthies to apprise me of it.</p>
<p>The nub of the matter is as follows:</p>
<p>On 24 February Church Street <span class="context">[i.e., the Fraternal Society of French Social Democrats]</span> are holding a banquet to which they have invited Blanc and Ledru-Rollin and, among others, Landolphe. Louis Blanc, anxious to show Ledru-Rollin that he too has a cosmopolitan committee behind him, and to punish Church Street for treating him and Ledru as ‘of equal importance’, rallied his army from Great Windmill Street <span class="context">[i.e., the German Workers' Educational Society]</span> and from the pub where the feckless Poles foregather.</p>
<p><i>Encore un coup! Quen dis-tu?</i></p>
<p>A few days ago Church Street received a printed circular (combining a <i>manifesto</i>) with an invitation to a monster banquet on 24 February, and signed <i>primo</i> Landolphe and, immediately after, Schapper, L. Blanc. Intense indignation in Church Street! Intense delight in Great Windmill Street!</p>
<p>In the circular-manifesto Louis Blanc does not speak in the name of a nation, but in the name and on behalf of the eternal formula: <i>liberté, égalité, fraternité</i>! The only fly in the ointment so far as I'm concerned is that I still owe Landolphe £1/10s. which ought now to be sent him forthwith through <span class="context">[Ferdinand]</span> Wolff.</p>
<p>You can easily imagine how greatly Willich and Schapper have grown in their own esteem and how they fancy us beaten!</p>
<p>But we'll beat them in a different sense. We are well on the way to driving Corporal and Carpenter Willich <i>mad, literaliter</i> mad.</p>
<p>You will recall the letter written to Willich by Schramm on <span class="context">[Herman]</span> Becker’s behalf, in which he offered him military dictatorship, abolished the press, and cast mild aspersions on Schapper’s moral character.</p>
<p><i>Eh bien</i>! Willich, the uneducated, four times cuckolded jackass, fell into the trap. He has been bombarding Becker with letters, already has an envoy awaiting dispatch, treats Schapper <i>de haut en bas</i> <span class="context">[superciliously]</span>, ignores, insults and intrigues against that worthy man in every possible manner, has already adopted the overbearing manner of a Cromwell II, has grown irascible, no longer tolerates contradiction, and has entrusted Becker with the task of starting a revolution in Cologne, after which he declares himself ready to assume the supreme leadership.</p>
<p>A short time ago, while in company, he suddenly jumped up shouting that his letters from Paris and Cologne had not yet arrived - it was on the occasion of the last French ministerial crisis - complained that his (stupid head) was in a whirl, whirl, whirl, dashed off to Bond Street and had a bucket of water poured over it. I now have a shower-bath prepared for him which should have quite the opposite effect. In a few days’ time Becker is going to let me have Willich’s letters and then I shall spring the mine.</p>
<p>A fresh swarm of democratic scallywags here, Frenchmen driven out of Brussels, Heise from Cassel, Oppenheim from Brussels, Günther from Frankfurt, etc. Fortunately, however, I have seen none of the latter.</p>
<p>You did receive my last letter, didn’t you?</p>

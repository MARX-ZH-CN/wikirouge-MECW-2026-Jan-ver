<h4>May 17, 1889</h4>
<p class="fst">Aveling’s play went off better than I had expected — it is a sketch, very well done, but ends — in Ibsen’s manner — without a solution and the public here is not accustomed to that. This piece was followed by another — by Baby Rose and someone else — a very free English version of Echegaray’s <i>Conflictos entre dos deberes</i>. <span class="context">[The Conflict of Two Duties]</span> This one, being highly spiced with sensationalism, was very well received, although it is heavy and vulgar and to the English taste.</p>

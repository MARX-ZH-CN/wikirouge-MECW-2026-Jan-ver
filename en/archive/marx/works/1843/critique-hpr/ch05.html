<a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PR304" target=_blank>§ 304</a>.  The Estates, as an element in political life,
still retain in their own function the class distinctions already
present in the lower spheres of civil life.  The position of the
classes is abstract to begin with, i.e., in contrast with the
whole principle of monarchy or the crown, their position is that
of an extreme — empirical universality.  This extreme opposition
implies the possibility, though no more, of harmonisation, and
the equally likely possibility of set hostility.  This abstract
position changes into a rational relation (into a syllogism, see
<a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PRn302" target=_blank><b>Remark to § 302</b></a>) only if the middle term between the
opposites comes into existence.  From the point of view of the crown,
the executive already has this character (see <a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PR300" target=_blank>§ 300</a>).
 So, from the point of view of the classes, one moment in them
must be adapted to the task of existing as in essence the moment
of mediation.
</span>
</p><a id="002"></a>
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
<a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PR305" target=_blank>§ 305</a>.  The principle of one of the classes of civil
society is in itself capable of adaptation to this political position.
 The class in question is the one whose ethical life is natural,
whose basis is family life, and, so far as its livelihood is concerned,
the possession of land.  Its particular members attain their position
by birth, just as the monarch does, and, in common with him, they
possess a will which rests on itself al6ne.
</span>
</p><a id="003"></a>
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
<a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PR306" target=_blank>§ 306</a>.  This class is more particularly fitted for
political position and significance in that its capital is independent
alike of the state's capital, the uncertainty of business, the
quest for profit, and any sort of fluctuation in possessions.
 It is likewise independent of favour, whether from the executive
or the mob.  It is even fortified against its own wilfulness,
because those members of this class who are called to political
life are not entitled, as other citizens are, either to dispose
of their entire property at will, or to the assurance that it
will pass to their children, whom they love equally, in similarly
equal divisions.  Hence their wealth becomes inalienable, entailed,
and burdened by primogeniture.
</span>
</p><a id="004"></a>
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
<b>Addition: </b>This class has a volition of a more
independent character.  On the whole, the class of landed-property
owners is divided into an educated section and a section of farmers.
 But over against both of these sorts of people there stands the
business class, which is dependent on needs and concentrated on
their satisfaction, and the civil servant class, which is essentially
dependent on the state.  The security and stability of the agricultural
class may be still further increased by the institution of primogeniture,
though this institution is desirable only from the point of view
of politics, since it entails a sacrifice for the political end
of giving the eldest son a life of independence.  Primogeniture
is grounded on the fact that the state should be able to reckon
not on the bare possibility of political inclinations, but on
something necessary.  Now an inclination for politics is of course
not bound up with wealth, but there is a relatively necessary
connection between the two, because a man with independent means
is not hemmed in by external circumstances and so there is nothing
to prevent him from entering politics and working for the state.
 Where Political institutions are lacking, however, the foundation
and encouragement of primogeniture is nothing but a chain on the
freedom of private rights, and either political meaning must be
given to it, or else it will in due course disappear.

<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
<a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PR307" target=_blank>§ 307</a>.  The right of this section of the agriculture
class is thus based in a way on the natural principle of the family.
 But this principle is at the same time reversed owing to hard
sacrifices made for political ends, and thereby the activity of
this class is essentially directed to those ends.  As a consequence
of this, this class is summoned and entitled to its political
vocation by birth without the hazards of election.  It therefore
has the fixed substantive position between the subjective wilfulness
or contingency of both extremes; and while it mirrors in itself.
. . 1 the moment of the monarchical power, it also shares in
other respects the needs and rights of the other extreme [i.e.,
civil society], and hence it becomes a support at once of the
throne and society.
</span>
</p><a id="006"></a>
<p class="fst">
Hegel has accomplished the masterpiece: he has developed peerage
by birthright, wealth by inheritance, etc. etc., this support
of the throne and society, on top of the absolute Idea.
</p><a id="007"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p76-->
Hegel's keenest insight lies in his sensing the separation of
civil and political society to be a contradiction.  But his error
is that he contents himself with the appearance of its dissolution,
and passes it off as the real thing; while the 'so-called theories'
which he despises demand the separation of the civil and political
classes, and rightly, for they express a consequence of modern
society, in that here the political Estates are precisely nothing
but the factual expression of the actual relationship of state
and civil society — their separation.
</p><a id="008"></a>
<p class="fst">
Hegel has failed to identify the issue in question here.  It
is the issue of representative versus Estate constitution.  The
representative constitution is a great advance, for it is the
open, genuine, consistent expression of the condition of the modern
state.  It is the unconcealed contradiction.
</p><a id="009"></a>
<p class="fst">
Before we take up this matter itself, let's take another look
at this Hegelian presentation.
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
In the Estates as an element in the legislative power, the unofficial
class acquires its political significance.
</span>
</p><a id="010"></a>
<p class="fst">
Earlier (in the <a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PRn301" target=_blank><b>Remark to § 301</b></a>) it was said:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
Hence the specific function which the concept assigns to the Estates
is to be sought in the fact that in them ... the private judgment
and private will of the sphere called 'civil society' in this
book come into existence integrally related to the state.
</span>
</p><a id="011"></a>
<p class="fst">
The meaning of these two, taken in combination, is as follows:
Civil society is the unofficial class, or, the unofficial class
is the immediate, essential, concrete class of civil society.
 Only within the Estates as an element of the legislative power
does it acquire political significance and efficacy.  This is
a new endowment, a particular function, for precisely its character
as unofficial class expresses its opposition to political significance
and efficacy, the privation of political character, and the fact
that civil society actually lacks political significance and efficacy.
 The unofficial class is the class of civil society, or civil
society is the unofficial class.  Thus, in consequence, Hegel
also excludes the universal class from the Estates as an element
of the legislative power:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
The universal class, or, more precisely, the class of civil servants,
must purely in virtue of its character as universal, have the
universal as the end of its essential activity.
</span>
</p><a id="012"></a>
<p class="fst">
In virtue of its character, civil society, or the unofficial class,
does not have the universal as the end of its essential activity.
 Its essential activity is not a determination of the universal;
it has no universal character.  The unofficial class is the class
of civil society as opposed to the [political] class.' The class
of civil society is not a political class.
</p><a id="013"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p77-->
In declaring civil society to be the unofficial class, Hegel has
declared the class differences of civil society to be non-political
differences and civil and political life to be heterogeneous in
character, even antitheses.  How then does he proceed?
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
[The unofficial class] appears, therefore, in the Estates neither
as a mere indiscriminate multitude nor as an aggregate dispersed
into its atoms, but as what it already is, namely a class subdivided
into two, one sub-class [the agricultural class] being based
on a tie of substance between its members, and the other [the
business class] on particular needs and the work whereby these
are met (see <a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prcivils.html#PR201" target=_blank>§ 201 ff.</a>). It is only in this way that
there is a genuine link between the particular which is effective
in the state and the universal.
</span>
</p><a id="014"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p77-->
To be sure, civil society (the unofficial class), in its legislative
activity in the Estates, cannot appear as a mere indiscriminate
multitude because the mere indiscriminate multitude exists only
in imagination or fantasy, but not in actuality.  What actually
exists is only accidental multitudes of various sizes (cities,
villages, etc.). These multitudes, or this aggregate not only
<i><b>appears</b> </i>but everywhere really <b><i>is </i></b>an aggregate
dispersed into its atoms; and when it appears in its political-class
activity it <i><b>must</b></i> appear as this atomistic thing.
 The unofficial class, civil society, cannot appear here as what
it already is.  For what is it already?  Unofficial class, i.e.,
opposition to and separation from the state.  In order to achieve
political significance and efficacy it must rather renounce itself
as what it already is, as unofficial class.  Only through this
does it acquire its political significance and efficacy.  This
political act is a complete transubstantiation.  In this political
act civil society must completely renounce itself as such, as
unofficial class, and assert a part of its essence which not only
has nothing in common with the actual civil existence of its essence,
but directly opposes it.
</p><a id="015"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p77-->
What the universal law is appears here in the individual.  Civil
society and the state are separated.  Consequently the citizen
of the state and the member of civil society are also separated.
 The individual must thus undertake an essential schism within
himself As actual citizen he finds himself in a two-fold organisation:
<b>[a]</b> the bureaucratic, which is an external formal
determination of the otherworldly state, of the executive power,
which does not touch him and his independent actuality; <b>[b]</b>
the social, the organisation of civil society, within which he
stands outside the state as a private man, for civil society does
not touch upon the political state as such.  The former [the bureaucratic]
is an organisation of the state to which he continually contributes
the material.  The latter [the social] is a civil organisation
whose material is not the state.  In the former the state relates
to him as formal opposition; in the latter he himself relates
to the state as material opposition.  Thus, in order to behave
as actual citizen of the state, to acquire political significance
and efficacy, he must abandon his civil actuality, abstract from
it, and retire from this entire organisation into his individuality.
 He must do this because the only existence that he finds for
his state-citizenship is his pure, bare individuality, for the
existence of the state as executive is complete without him, and
his existence in civil society is complete without the state.
 Only in opposition to these exclusively existing communities,
only as an individual, can he be a citizen of the state.  His
existence as citizen is an existence lying outside the realm of
his communal existences, and is hence purely individual.  The
legislature as a power is precisely the organisation, the communal
embodiment, which his political existence is supposed to receive.
 Prior to the legislature, civil society, or the unofficial class,
does not exist as political organisation.  In order that it come
to existence as such, its actual organisation, actual civil life,
must be established as non-existing, for the Estates as an element
of the legislative power have precisely the character of rendering
the unofficial class, civil society, non-existent.  The separation
of civil society and the political state appears necessarily to
be a separation of the political citizen, the citizen of the state,
from civil society, i.e., from his own actual, empirical reality;
for as a state-idealist he is a being who is completely other,
distinct, different from and opposed to his own actuality.  Here
civil society effects within itself the relationship of the state
and civil society, a relationship which already exists on the
other side [i.e., within the state] as the bureaucracy. in the
Estates the universal becomes actually, explicitly [<i>für
sich</i>] what it is implicitly [<i>an sich</i>], namely,
opposition to the particular.  The citizen must renounce his class,
civil society, the unofficial class, in order to achieve political
significance and efficacy; for it is precisely this class which
stands between the individual and the political state.
</p><a id="016"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p78-->
If Hegel already contrasts the whole of civil society as unofficial
class to the political state, then it is self-evident that the
distinctions within the unofficial class, i.e., the various civil
classes, have only an unofficial significance with regard to the
state; in other words, they have no political significance.  For
the various civil classes are simply the actualisation, the existence,
of the principle, i.e., of the unofficial class as of the principle
of civil society.  If, however, the principle must be abandoned,
then it is self-evident that still more the schisms within this
principle are non-existent for the political state.
</p><a id="017"></a>
<p class="fst">
'It is only in this way', says Hegel in concluding the paragraph,
'that there is a genuine link between the particular which is
effective in the state and the universal.' But here Hegel confuses
the state as the whole of a people's existence with the political
state.  That particular is not the particular in, but rather <i><b>outside</b>
</i>the state, namely, the political state.  It is not only not
the particular which is effective in the state, but also the ineffectiveness
[<i>Unwirklichkeit</i>] of the state.  What Hegel wants
to establish is that the classes of civil society are political
classes; and in order to prove this he asserts that the classes
of civil society are the particularity of the political state,
that is to say, that civil society is political society.  The
expression, 'The particular in the state', can here only mean
the particularity of the state.  A bad conscience causes Hegel
to choose the vague expression.  Not only has he himself developed
just the opposite, but he even ratifies it in this paragraph by
characterising civil society as the 'unofficial class'.  His statement
that the particular is 'linked' to the universal is very cautious.
 The most dissimilar things can be linked.  But here we are not
dealing with a gradual transition but with a transubstantiation,
and it is useless to ignore deliberately this cleft which has
been jumped over and yet manifested by the very jump.
</p><a id="018"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p79-->
In the Remark Hegel says: 'This runs counter to another prevalent
idea' etc.  We have just shown how this prevalent idea is consequently
and inevitably a necessary idea of the people's present development,
and how Hegel's idea, despite its also being very prevalent in
certain circles, is nevertheless untrue.
</p><a id="019"></a>
<p class="fst">
Returning to this prevalent idea Hegel says: 'This atomistic and
abstract point of view vanishes at the stage of the family' etc.
etc.  'The state, however, is' etc.  This point of view is undeniably
abstract, but it is the abstraction of the political state as
Hegel himself develops it.  It is atomistic too, but it is the
atomism of society itself.  The point of view cannot be concrete
when the object of the point of view is abstract.  The atomism
into which civil society is driven by its political act results
necessarily from the fact that the commonwealth [<i>das Gemeinwesen</i>],
the communal being [<i>das kommunistische Wesen</i>],
within which the individual exists, is [reduced to] civil
society separated from the state, or in other words, that the
political state is an abstraction of civil society.'
</p><a id="020"></a>
<p class="fst">
This atomistic point of view, although it already vanishes in
the family, and perhaps (??) also in civil society, recurs in
the political state precisely because the political state is an
abstraction of the family and civil society.  But the reverse
is also true.  By expressing the strangeness [<i>das Befremdliche</i>]
of this occurrence Hegel has not eliminated the estrangement [<i>die
Entfremdung</i>].
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
The circles of association in civil society, Hegel continues,
are already communities.  To picture these communities as once
more breaking up into a mere conglomeration of individuals as
soon as they enter the field of politics, i.e., the field of the
highest concrete universality, is <i>eo ipso </i>to hold civil
and political life apart from one another and as it were to hang
the latter in the air, because its basis could then only be the
abstract individuality of caprice and opinion, and hence it would
be grounded on chance and not on what is absolutely stable and
justified.
</span>
</p><a id="021"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p80-->
This picturing [of these communities as breaking up] does not
hold civil and political life apart; it is simply the picturing
of an actually existing separation.
</p><a id="022"></a>
<p class="fst">
Nor does this picturing hang political life in the air; rather,
political life is the life in the air, the ethereal region of
civil society.
</p><a id="023"></a>
<p class="fst">
Now we turn to the representative and the Estate systems.
</p><a id="024"></a>
<p class="fst">
It is a development of history that has transformed the political
classes into social classes such that, just as the Christians
are equal in heaven yet unequal on earth, so the individual members
of a people are equal in the heaven of their political world yet
unequal in the earthly existence of society.  The real transformation
of the political classes into civil classes took place under the
absolute monarchy.  The bureaucracy asserted the idea of unity
over against the various states within the state.  Nevertheless,
even alongside the bureaucracy of the absolute executive, the
social difference of the classes remained a political difference,
political within and alongside the bureaucracy of the absolute
executive.  Only the French Revolution completed the transformation
of the political classes into social classes, in other words,
made the class distinctions of civil society into merely social
distinctions, pertaining to private life but meaningless in political
life.  With that, the separation of political life and civil society
was completed.
</p><a id="025"></a>
<p class="fst">
At the same time the classes of civil society were likewise transformed:
civil society underwent a change by reason of its separation from
political society.  Class in the medieval sense remained only
within the bureaucracy itself, where civil and political positions
are immediately identical.  Over against this stands civil society
as unofficial class.  Here class distinction is no longer one
of need and of labor as an independent body.  The sole general,
superficial and formal distinction which remains is that of town
and country.  But within civil society itself the distinctions
take shape in changeable, unfixed spheres whose principle is arbitrariness.
 Money and education are the prevalent criteria.  Yet it's not
here, but in the critique of Hegel's treatment of civil society
that this should be developed.  Enough said.  Class in civil society
has neither need — and therefore a natural impulse — nor politics
for its principle.  It is a division of the masses whose development
is unstable and whose very structure is arbitrary and in no sense
an organisation.
</p><a id="026"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p81-->
The sole characteristic thing is that the lack of property, and
the class in need of immediate labor, of concrete labor, forms
less a class of civil society than the basis upon which the spheres
of civil society rest and move.  The sole class in which political
and civil positions coincide is that of the members of the executive
power.  The present social class already manifests a distinction
from the former class of civil society by the fact that it does
not, as was formerly the case, regard the individual as a communal
in individual, as a communal being [<i>ein Gemeinwesen</i>];
rather, it is partly chance, partly labor, etc., of the individual
which determines whether he remains in his class or not, a class
which is, further, only an external determination of this individual;
for he neither inheres in his work nor does the class relate to
him as an objective communal being organised according to firm
laws and related firmly to him.  Moreover, he stands in no actual
relation to his substantial activity, to his actual class.  The
medical man, for instance, forms no particular class in civil
society. one businessman belongs to a class different than that
of another businessman, i.e., he belongs to another social position.
 Just as civil society is separated from political society, so
within itself civil society is separated into class and social
position, even though some relations obtain between the two. 
The principle of the civil class, or of civil society, is enjoyment
and the capacity to enjoy.  In his political role the member of
civil society rids himself of his class, of his actual private
position; by this alone does he acquire significance as man. in
other words, his character as a member of the state, as a social
being, appears to be his human character.  For all of his other
characteristics in civil society appear to be unessential to the
man, the individual; that is, they appear to be external characteristics
which are indeed necessary to his existence within the whole,
i.e., as being a bond with the whole, but a bond that he can just
as well throw off. (Present civil society is the accomplished
principle of individualism: individual existence is the final
end, while activity, labor, content, etc., are merely means.)
</p><a id="027"></a>
<p class="fst">
The Estate-constitution, when not a tradition of the Middle Ages,
is the attempt, partly within the political sphere itself, to
thrust man back into the limitation of his private sphere, to
make his particularity his substantial consciousness and, by means
of the political character of class difference, also to make him
once more into a social being.
</p><a id="028"></a>
<p class="fst">
The actual man is the private man of the present-day political
constitution.
</p><a id="029"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p82-->
In general, the significance of the estate is that it makes difference,
separation, subsistence, things pertaining to the individual as
such.' His manner of life, activity, etc. is his privilege, and
instead of making him a functional member of society, it makes
him an exception from society.  The fact that this difference
is not only individual but also established as community, estate,
corporation, not only fails to abolish the exclusiveness of its
nature, but is rather its expression.  Instead of the particular
function being a function of society, the particular function
is made into a society for itself.
</p><a id="030"></a>
<p class="fst">
Not only is the estate based on the separation of society as the
governing principle, but it separates man from his universal nature;
it makes him an animal whose being coincides immediately with
its determinate character.  The Middle Ages constitutes the animal
history of mankind, its zoology.
</p><a id="031"></a>
<p class="fst">
Modern times, civilisation, commits the opposite mistake.  It
separates man s objective essence from him, taking it to be merely
external and material.  Man's content is not taken to be his true
actuality.
</p><a id="032"></a>
<p class="fst">
Anything further regarding this is to be developed in the section
on 'Civil Society'.
</p><a id="033"></a>
<p class="fst">
Now we come to
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
<a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PR304" target=_blank>§ 304</a>.  The Estates, as an element in political life, still retain in their own significance, the class distinctions already present in the lower spheres of civil life.
</span>
</p><a id="034"></a>
<p class="fst">
We have already shown that the class distinctions already present
in the lower spheres of life have no significance for the political
spheres, or if so, then only the significance of private, hence
non-political, distinctions.  But according to Hegel here they
do not even have their already present significance (their significance
in civil society).  Rather, the Estates as an element in political
life affirms its essence by embodying these distinctions within
itself; and, thus immersed in political life, they receive a significance
of their 'own' which belongs not to them but to this element.
</p><a id="035"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p83-->
As long as the organisation of civil society remained political,
and the political state and civil society were one, this separation,
this duplication of the estates' significance was not present.
 The estates did not signify one thing in the civil world and
something other in the political world.  They acquired no [additional]
significance in the political world, but signified only themselves.
 The duality of civil society and the political state, which the
Estate-constitution purports to resolve through a reminiscence,
appears within that constitution itself, in that class difference
(the differentiation within civil society) acquires in the political
sphere a significance different than in the civil sphere.  There
is apparent identity here: the same subject, but in an essentially
different determination, and thus in fact a double subject.  And
this illusory identity (surely an illusory identity because, in
fact, the actual subject, man, remains constantly himself,
does not lose his identity in the various determinations of his
being; but here man is not the subject, rather he is identified
with a predicate — the class — and at the same time it is asserted
that he exists in this definite determination and in another determination,
that he is, as this definite, exempted and restricted thing, something
other than this restricted thing) is artificially maintained through
that reflection [mentioned earlier], by at one time having civil
class distinction as such assume a character which should accrue
to it only in the political sphere, and at another time reversing
things and having the class distinction in the political sphere
acquire a character which issues not from the political sphere
but from the subject of the civil sphere.  In order to present
the one limited subject, the definite class (the class distinction),
as the essential subject of both predicates, or in order to prove
the identity of the two predicates, both are mystified and developed
in an illusory and vague dimorphism [<i>Doppelgestalt</i>].
</p><a id="036"></a>
<p class="fst">
Here the same subject is taken in different meanings, but the
meaning is not a self-determination [of the subject]; rather,
it is an allegorical determination foisted on the subject.  One
could use the same meaning for a different concrete subject, or
another meaning for the same subject.  The significance that civil
class distinction acquires in the political sphere is not its
own, but proceeds from the political sphere; and even here it
could have a different significance, as was historically the case.
 The reverse is also true.  This is the uncritical, the mystical
way of interpreting an old world-view in terms of a new one, through
which it becomes nothing but an unhappy hybrid in which the form
betrays the meaning and the meaning the form, and neither does
the form achieve significance, thus becoming actual form, nor
the significance become form, thus becoming actual significance.
 This uncritical spirit, this mysticism, is the enigma of the
modern constitution (<font face="symbol">kat exohin</font> the Estate-constitution)
as well as the mystery of Hegelian philosophy, especially the
<i>Philosophy of Right </i>and <i>the Philosophy of Religion.</i>
</p><a id="037"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p84-->
The best way to rid oneself of this illusion is to take the significance
as what it is, i.e., as the actual determination, then as such
make it the subject, and consider whether its ostensibly proper
subject is its actual predicate, i.e., whether this ostensibly
proper subject expresses its [the actual determination's] essence
and true actualisation.
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
The position of the classes (the Estates as an element in political
life), is abstract to begin with, i.e., in contrast with the whole
principle of monarchy or the crown, their position is that of
an extreme — empirical universality.  This extreme opposition
implies the possibility, though no more, of harmonisation, and
the equally likely possibility of set hostility.  This abstract
position changes into a rational relation (into a syllogism, see
<a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PRn302" target=_blank><b>Remark to § 302</b></a>) only if the middle term between the
opposites comes into existence.
</span>
</p><a id="038"></a>
<p class="fst">
We have already seen that the Estates, in common with the executive
power, form the middle term between the principle of monarchy
and the people, between the will of the state existing as one
and as many empirical Wills, and between empirical singularity
and empirical universality. just as he had to define the will
of civil society as empirical universality, so Hegel had to define
the sovereign will as empirical singularity; but he does not articulate
the antithesis in all of its sharpness.

Hegel continues:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
From the point of view of the crown, the executive already has
this character (see <a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PR300" target=_blank>§ 300</a>).  So, from the point of
view of the classes, one moment in them must be adapted to the
task of existing as in essence the moment of mediation.
</span>
</p><a id="040"></a>
<p class="fst">
The true antitheses, however, are the sovereign and civil society.
 And as we have already seen, the Estates have the same significance
from the people's point of view as the executive has from the
point of view of the sovereign. just as the executive emanates
in an elaborate circular system, so the people condenses into
a miniature edition; for the constitutional monarchy can get along
well only with the people <i>en miniature</i>.  The Estates, from
the point of view of civil society, are the very same abstraction
of the political state as is the executive from the sovereign's
point of view.  Thus it appears that the mediation has been fully
achieved.  Both extremes have left their obstinacy behind, each
has imparted the spirit of its particular essence into a fusion
with that of the other; and the legislature, whose elements are
the executive as well as the Estates, appears not to be that which
must first allow this mediation to come to existence, but to be
itself the already existing mediation.  Also, Hegel has already
[<a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PR302" target=_blank>§ 302</a>] declared the Estates in common with the executive
to be the middle term between the people and the sovereign (the
same way the Estates are the middle term between civil society
and the executive, etc.). Thus the rational relation, the syllogism,
appears to be complete.  The legislature, the middle term, is
a <i>mixtum compositum </i>of both extremes: the sovereign-principle
and civil society, empirical singularity and empirical universality,
subject and predicate.  In general, Hegel conceives of the syllogism
as middle term, to be a <i>mixtum compositum.  </i>We can say
that in his development of the rational syllogism all of the transcendence
and mystical dualism of his system becomes apparent.  The middle
term is the wooden sword, the concealed opposition between universality
and singularity.
</p><a id="041"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p85-->
To begin with, we notice in regard to this whole development that
the mediation Hegel wants to establish here is not derived from
the essence of the legislature, from its own character, but rather
with regard to an existence lying outside its essential character.
 It is a construction of reference.  The legislature is chiefly
developed with regard only to a third [party].  Hence, it is primarily
the construction of its formal existence which receives all the
attention.  The legislature is constructed very diplomatically.
 This results from the false, illusory <font face="symbol">kat exohin</font> political
position given to the legislature in the modern state (whose interpreter
is Hegel himself).  What follows immediately is that this is no
true state, because in it the determinate functions of the state,
one of which is the legislature, must not be regarded in and for
themselves, not theoretically, but rather practically; they must
not be regarded as independent powers, but as powers bound up
with an opposite, and this in accordance with the rules of convention
rather than by the nature of things.
</p><a id="042"></a>
<p class="fst">
Thus the Estates, in common with the executive, should actually
be the middle term between the will of empirical singularity,
i.e., the sovereign, and the will of empirical universality, i.e.,
civil society.  But in fact their position is really 'abstract
to begin with, i.e., in contrast with the whole principle of monarchy
or the crown, their position is that of an extreme empirical universality.
 This extreme opposition implies the possibility, though no more,
of harmonisation, and the equally likely possibility of set hostility.
 In other words their position, as Hegel quite rightly remarks,
is an abstract position.
</p><a id="043"></a>
<p class="fst">
It appears at first that neither the extreme of empirical universality
nor the principle of monarchy or the crown, i.e., the extreme
of empirical singularity, are opposed to one another.  For from
the point of view of civil society the Estates are delegated just
as the executive is from the point of view of the sovereign. just
as the principle of the crown ceases,
in the delegated executive power, to be the extreme of empirical
singularity, surrendering its self-determined will and lowering
itself to the finitude of knowledge, responsibility, and thought,
so civil society appears in the Estates to be no longer an empirical
universality, but a very definite whole which has political and
administrative sense and temper, and no less a sense for the interests
of individuals and particular groups (<a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PR302" target=_blank>§ 302</a>).  Civil
society, in its miniature edition as the Estates, has ceased to
be empirical universality.  Rather, it has been reduced to a delegated
committee of very definite number.  If the sovereign assumes empirical
universality in the executive power, then civil society assumes
empirical singularity or particularity in the Estates.  Both have
become a particular.
</p><a id="044"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p86-->
The only opposition which remains possible appears to be that
between the two emanations, between the executive- and the Estate-elements
within the legislature.  It appears, therefore, to be an opposition
within the legislature itself.  And these elements which mediate
'in common' seem quite prone to get into one another's hair. 
In the executive element of the legislature the inaccessible empirical
singularity of the sovereign has come down to earth in a number
of limited, tangible, responsible personalities; and in the Estates,
civil society has exalted itself into a number of political men.
 Both sides have lost their inaccessibility.  The crown — the
inaccessible, exclusive, empirical One — has lost its obstinacy,
while civil society — the inaccessible, vague, empirical All — has
lost its fluidity.  In the Estates on the one hand, and the executive
element of the legislature on the other, which together would
mediate between civil society and the sovereign, the opposition
thus appears to have become, first of all, a refereed opposition,
but also an irreconcilable contradiction.
</p><a id="045"></a>
<p class="fst">
As for this mediation, it is therefore, as Hegel rightly argues,
all the more necessary that the middle term between the opposites
comes into existence; for it is itself much more the existence
of the contradiction than of the mediation.
</p><a id="046"></a>
<p class="fst">
That this mediation will be effected by the Estates seems to be
maintained by Hegel without any foundation.  He says:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
From the point of view of the crown, the executive already has
this character (see <a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PR300" target=_blank>§ 300</a>).  So, from the point of
view of the classes, one moment in them must be adapted to the
task of existing as in essence the moment of mediation.
</span>
</p><a id="047"></a>
<p class="fst">
But we have already seen that Hegel arbitrarily and inconsistently
posits the sovereign and the Estates as opposed extremes.  As
the executive has this character from the point of view of the
crown, so the Estates have it from the point of view of civil
society.  Not only do [the Estates] stand, in common with the
executive, between the sovereign and civil society, but also between
the executive in general and the people (<a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PR302" target=_blank>§ 302</a>). 
They do more on behalf of civil society than the executive does
on behalf of the crown, which is itself in opposition to the people.
 Thus they have accomplished their full measure of mediation.
 Why make these asses bear still more?  Why should they always
be made the donkey-bridge, even between themselves and their own
adversaries?  Why must they always perform the self-sacrifice?
 Should they cut off one of their hands when both are needed to
withstand their adversary, the executive element of the legislature?
</p><a id="048"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p87-->
In addition, Hegel first has the Estates arise from the Corporations,
class distinctions, etc., lest they be a mere empirical universality;
and now he reverses the process, and makes them mere empirical
universality in order to have class distinction arise from them!
just as the sovereign is mediated with civil society through
the executive, so society is mediated with the executive through
the Estates — the executive thus acting as society's Christ, and
the Estates as its priests.
</p><a id="049"></a>
<p class="fst">
Now it appears all the more that the role of the extremes — the
crown (empirical singularity) and civil society (empirical universality)
- must be that of mediating as the middle term between the opposites;
all the more because 'it is one of the most important discoveries
of logic that a specific moment which, by standing in an opposition,
has the position of an extreme, ceases to be such and is a moment
in an organic whole by being at the same time the mean' (<a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PRn302" target=_blank><b>Remark
to § 302</b></a>).  Civil society appears  to be unable to play
this role, for civil society as itself, as an extreme, occupies
no seat in the legislature.  The other extreme, the sovereign
principle, exists as an extreme within the legislature, and thus
apparently must be the mediator between the Estate- and the executive-elements.
 And it appears to have all the qualifications; for, on the one
hand, the whole of the state, and therefore also civil society,
is represented within it,
and, more specifically, it has empirical singularity of will in
common with the Estates, since empirical universality is actual
only as empirical singularity.  Furthermore, the sovereign principle
does not merely op pose civil society as a kind of formula, as
state-consciousness, the way the executive does.  It is itself
the state; it has the material, natural moment in common with
civil society.  On the other hand, it is the head and the representative
of the executive. (Hegel, who inverts everything, makes the executive
the representative, the emanation, of the sovereign.  When he
considers the idea whose existence the sovereign is supposed to
be, Hegel has in mind not the actual idea of the executive, the
executive as idea, but rather the subject of the Absolute Idea
which exists corporeally in the sovereign; hence the executive
becomes a mystical continuation of the soul existing in his body
- the sovereign body.)
</p><a id="050"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p88-->
The sovereign, then, had to be the middle term in the legislature
between the executive and the Estates; but, of course, the executive
is the middle term between him and the Estates, and the Estates
between him and civil society.  How is he to mediate between what
he himself needs as a mean lest his own existence become a one-sided
extreme?  Now the complete absurdity of these extremes, which
interchangeably play now the part of the extreme and now the part
of the mean, becomes apparent.  They are like Janus with two-faced
heads, which now show themselves from the front and now from the
back, with a diverse character at either side.  What was first
intended to be the mean between two extremes now itself occurs
as an extreme; and the other of the two extremes, which had just
been mediated by it, now intervenes as an extreme' (because of
its distinction from the other extreme) between its extreme and
its mean.  This is a kind of mutual reconciliation society.  It
is as if a man stepped between two opponents, only to have one
of them immediately step between the mediator and the other opponent.
 It is like the story of the man and wife who quarrelled and the
doctor who wished to mediate between them, whereupon the wife
soon had to step between the doctor and her husband, and then
the husband between his wife and the doctor.  It is like the lion
in <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream </i>who exclaims: 'I am the lion,
and I am not the lion, but Snug.'  So here each extreme is sometimes
the lion of opposition and sometimes the Snug of mediation.  When
the one extreme cries: 'Now I am the mean', then the other two
may not touch it, but rather only swing at the one that was just
the extreme.  As one can see, this is a society pugnacious at
heart but too afraid of bruises to ever really fight.  The two
who want to fight arrange it so that the third who steps between
them will get the beating, but immediately one of the two appears
as the third, and because of all this caution they never arrive
at a decision.  We find this system of mediation in effect also
where the very man who wishes to beat an opponent has at the same
time to protect him from a beating at the hands of other opponents,
and because of this double pursuit never manages to execute his
own business.  It is remarkable that Hegel, who reduces this absurdity
of mediation to its abstract logical, and hence pure and irreducible,
expression, calls it at the same time the speculative mystery
of logic, the rational relationship, the rational syllogism. 
Actual extremes cannot be mediated with each other precisely because
they are actual extremes.  But neither are they in need of mediation,
because they are opposed in essence.  They have nothing in common
with one another; they neither need nor complement one another.
 The one does not carry in its womb the yearning, the need, the
anticipation of the other. (When Hegel treats universality and
singularity, the abstract moments of the syllogism, as actual
opposites, this is precisely the fundamental dualism of his logic.
 Anything further regarding this belongs in the critique of Hegelian
logic.)
</p><a id="051"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p89-->
This appears to be in opposition to the principle: <i>Les extrêmes
se touchent.  </i>The North and South Poles attract each other;
the female and male sexes also attract each other, and only through
the union of their extreme differences does man result.
</p><a id="052"></a>
<p class="fst">
On the other hand, each extreme is its other extreme.  Abstract
spiritualism is abstract materialism; abstract materialism is
the abstract spiritualism of matter.
</p><a id="053"></a>
<p class="fst">
In regard to the former, both North and South Poles are poles;
their essence is identical.  In the same way both female and male
gender are of one species, one nature, i.e., human nature.  North
and South Poles are opposed determinations of one essence, the
variation of one essence brought to its highest degree of development.
 They are the differentiated essence.  They are what they are
only as differentiated determinations; that is, each is <b><i>this
</i></b>differentiated determination of the one same essence.  Truly
in real extremes would be Pole and non-Pole, human and non-human
gender.  Difference here is one of existence, whereas there [i.e.,
in the case of Pole and non-Pole, etc.,] difference is one of
essence, i.e., the difference between two essences.
in regard to the second [i.e. where each extreme is its other
extreme], the chief characteristic lies in the fact that a concept
(existence, etc.) is taken abstractly, and that it does not have
significance as independent but rather as an abstraction from
another, and only as this abstraction.  Thus, for example, spirit
is only the abstraction from matter.  It is evident that precisely
because this form is to be the content of the concept, its real
essence is rather the abstract opposite, i.e., the object from
which it abstracts taken in its abstraction — in this case, abstract
materialism.
</p><a id="054"></a>
<p class="fst">
Had the difference within the existence of one essence not been
confused, in part, with the abstraction given independence (an
abstraction not from another, of course, but from itself) and,
in part, with the actual opposition of mutually exclusive essences,
then a three-fold error could have been avoided, namely:</p>
<p class="indent-list">
1. that because only the extreme is true, every abstraction and
one-sidedness takes itself to be the truth, whereby a principle
appears to be only an abstraction from another instead of a totality
in itself; 
</p>
<p class="indent-list">
2. that the decisiveness of actual opposites, their formation
into extremes, which is nothing other than their self-knowledge
as well as their inflammation to the decision to fight, is thought
to be something which should be prevented if possible, in other
words, something harmful; 
</p>
<p class="indent-list">
3. that their mediation is attempted.  For no matter how firmly
both extremes appear, in their existence, to be actual and to
be extremes, it still lies only in the essence of the one to be
an extreme, and it does not have for the other the meaning of
true actuality.  
</p><a id="055"></a>
<p class="fst">
The one infringes upon the other, but they do not occupy a common
position.  For example, Christianity, or religion in general,
and philosophy are extremes.  But in fact religion is not a true
opposite to philosophy, for philosophy comprehends religion in
its illusory actuality.  Thus, for philosophy — in so far as it
seeks to be an actuality — religion is dissolved in itself.  There
is no actual duality of essence.  More on this later.
</p><a id="056"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p90-->
The question arises, why does Hegel need a new mediation on the
side of the Estates at all?  Or does he share with [others] 
'the popular, but not dangerous prejudice, which regards the Estates
principally from the point of view of their opposition to the
executive, as if that were their essential attitude'? (<a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PRn302" target=_blank><b>Remark
to § 302</b></a>.)
</p><a id="057"></a>
<p class="fst">
The fact of the matter is simply this: On the one hand we have
seen that it is only in the legislature that civil society as
the element of the Estates, and the power of the crown as the
element of the executive have taken on the spirit of actual, immediately
practical opposition.
</p><a id="058"></a>
<p class="fst">
On the other hand, the legislature is the totality.  In it we
find <b>(1)</b> the deputation of the sovereign principle,
i.e., the executive; <b>(2)</b> the deputation of civil
society, i.e., the Estates; but in addition, <b>(3)</b>
the one extreme as such, i.e., the sovereign principle; while
the other extreme, civil society, does not exist in it as such.
 It is only because of this that the Estates become the extreme
to the sovereign principle, when civil society really should be.
 As we have seen, only as Estates does civil society organise
itself into a political existence.  The Estates are its political
existence, its transubstantiation into the political state.  Again
as we have seen, only the legislature is, therefore, the actual
political state in its totality.  Here, then, there is <b>(1)</b>
sovereign principle, <b>(2)</b> executive, <b>(3)</b>
civil society.  The Estates are the civil society of the political
state, i.e., the legislature.  The extreme to the sovereign, which
civil society was supposed to have been, is therefore the Estates.
(Because civil society is the non-actuality of political existence,
the political existence of civil society is its own dissolution,
its separation from itself.) Therefore it also constitutes an
opposition to t executive.
</p><a id="059"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p91-->
Hegel, therefore, again designates the Estates as the extreme
of empirical universality, which is actually civil society itself.
(Hence he unnecessarily allows the Estates, as an element in political
life, to proceed from the Corporations and different classes.
 This procedure would make sense only if the distinct classes
as such were in fact the legislative classes, if, accordingly,
the distinction of civil society — i.e., its civil character -
were <i>re vera</i> the political character.  We would then not
have a legislature of the state as a whole, but rather a legislature
of the various estates, Corporations, and classes over the state
as a whole.  The estates [or classes] of civil society would receive
no political character, but would rather determine the political
state.  They would make their particularity a power determining
the whole.  They would be the power of the particular over the
universal.  And we would not have one legislature, but several,
which would come to terms among themselves and with the executive.
 However, Hegel has in mind the Estates in the modern sense, namely
the actualisation of state citizenship, or of the Bourgeois. 
He does not want the actual universal, the political state, to
be determined by civil society, but rather civil society to be
determined by the state.  Thus while he accepts the Estates in
their medieval form, he gives them the opposite significance,
namely, that of being determined by the political state.  The
Estates as representatives of the Corporations, etc., would not
be empirical universality, but rather empirical particularity,
i.e., the particularity of the empirical!) The legislature, therefore,
needs mediation within itself, that is to say, a concealment of
the opposition.  And this mediation must come from the Estates
because in the legislature the Estates lose their significance
of being the representation of civil society and become the primary
element, the very civil society of the legislature.  The legislature
is the totality of the political state and, precisely because
of this, the contradiction of the political state brought forcibly
to appearance.  Thus it is also its established dissolution. 
Entirely different principles collide within it. To be sure, it
appears to be the opposition between the two elements, that of
the sovereign principle and that of the Estates, and so forth.
 But in fact it is the antinomy of political state and civil society,
the self-contradiction of the abstract political state.  The legislature
is the established revolt. (Hegel's chief mistake consists in
the fact that he conceives of the contradiction in appearance
as being a unity in essence, i.e., in the Idea; whereas it certainly
has something more profound in its essence, namely, an essential
contradiction.  For example here, the contradiction in the legislature
itself is nothing other than the contradiction of the political
state, and thus also the self-contradiction of civil society.
</p><a id="060"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p92-->
Vulgar criticism falls into an opposite dogmatic error.  Thus,
for example, it criticises the constitution, drawing attention
to the opposition Of the powers etc.  It finds contradictions
everywhere.  But criticism that struggles with its opposite remains
dogmatic criticism, as for example in earlier times, when the
dogma of the Blessed Trinity was set aside by appealing to the
contradiction between 1 and 3. True criticism, however, shows
the internal genesis of the Blessed Trinity in the human mind.
it describes the act of its birth.  Thus, true philosophical criticism
of the present state constitution not only shows the contradictions
as existing, but clarifies them, grasps their essence and necessity.
 It comprehends their own proper significance.  However, this
comprehension does not, as Hegel thinks, consist in everywhere
recognising the determinations of the logical concept, but rather
in grasping the proper logic of the proper object.)
</p><a id="061"></a>
<p class="fst">
As Hegel expresses it, the position of the political Estates relative
to the sovereign implies the possibility, though no more, of harmonisation,
and the equally likely possibility of set hostility.
</p><a id="062"></a>
<p class="fst">
The possibility of hostility is implied everywhere different volitions
meet.  Hegel himself says that the possibility of harmonisation
is the possibility of hostility.  Thus, he must now construct
an element which is both the impossibility of hostility and the
actuality of harmonisation.  For him, such an element would be
the freedom of decision and thought in face of the sovereign will
and the executive.  Thus it would no longer be an element belonging
to the Estates as an element in political life.  Rather, it would
be an element of the sovereign will and the executive, and would
stand in the same opposition to the actual Estates as does the
executive itself
</p><a id="063"></a>
<p class="fst">
This demand is already quite muted by the conclusion of the paragraph:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
From the point of view of the crown, the executive already has
this character (see <a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PR300" target=_blank>§ 300</a>).  So, from the point of
view of the classes, one moment in them must be adapted to the
task of existing as in essence the moment of mediation.
</span>
</p><a id="064"></a>
<p class="fst">
The moment which is dispatched from the estates [or classes] must
have a character the reverse of that which the executive has from
the point of view of the sovereign, since the sovereign and the
estates are opposite extremes. just as the sovereign democratises
himself in the executive, so this estate element must monarchise
itself in its deputation.  Thus what Hegel wants is a moment of
sovereignty issuing from the estates. just as the executive has
an estate-moment on behalf of the sovereign, so there should also
be a sovereign-moment on behalf of the estates.
</p><a id="065"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p93-->
The actuality of harmonisation and the impossibility of hostility
converts into the following demand: 'So, from the point of view
of the classes, one moment in them must be adapted to the task
of existing as in essence the moment of mediation.' Adapted to
the task!  According to <a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PR302" target=_blank>§ 302</a> the Estates as a whole
have this task.  It should not say 'task' but rather 'certainty'.
 And what kind of task is this anyway which exists as in essence
the moment of mediation — being in 'essence' Buridan's ass?
</p><a id="066"></a>
<p class="fst">
The fact of the matter is simply this:
</p><a id="067"></a>
<p class="fst">
The Estates are supposed to be the mediation between the crown
and the executive on the one hand, and the crown and the people
on the other.  But they are not this, but rather the organised
political opposition to civil society.  The legislature in itself
is in need of mediation, and indeed a mediation coming from the
Estates, as has been shown.  The presupposed moral harmonisation
of the two wills, the will of the state as sovereign will and
the will of the state as the will of civil society, does not suffice.
 Indeed only the legislature is the organised, total political
state; yet, precisely in it appears, because it is in its highest
degree of development, the open contradiction of the political
state with itself.  Thus, the appearance of a real identity of
the sovereign and Estate wills must be established.  Either the
Estates must be established as the sovereign will or the sovereign
will established as the Estates.  The Estates must establish themselves
as the actuality of a will which is not the will of the Estates.
 The unity which is non-existent in essence (otherwise it would
have to prove itself by the Estates' efficacy and not by their
mode of existing) must at least be present in existence, or else
an existing instance of the legislature (of the Estates) has the
task of being the unity of what is not united.  This moment of
the Estates, the Chamber of Peers, the Upper House, etc., is the
highest synthesis of the political state in the organisation just
considered.  With that, however, Hegel does not achieve what he
wants, namely, the actuality of harmonisation and the impossibility
of set hostility; rather, the whole thing remains at the point
of the possibility of harmonisation.  However, it is the established
illusion of the internal unity of the political state (of the
sovereign will and that of the Estates, and furthermore of the
principle of the political state and that of civil society), the
illusion of this unity as material principle, that is to say,
such that not only two opposed principles unite but that the unity
is that of one nature or existential ground.  The Estates, as
this moment, are the romanticism of the political state, the dreams
of its substantiality or internal harmony.  They are an allegorical
existence.
</p><a id="068"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p94-->
Whether this illusion is an effective illusion or a conscious
self-deception depends now on the actual <i>status quo </i>of
the relationship between the Estate and sovereign-elements.  As
long as the Estates and the crown in fact harmonise, or get along
together, the illusion in its essential unity is an actual, and
thus effective illusion.  But on the other hand, should the truth
of the illusion become manifest, then it becomes a conscious lie
and a ridicule.

 The class in question is the one whose ethical life is natural,

by birth, just as the monarch does, and, in common with him, they

What, then, does this principle capability, or capability in principle
of the agricultural class consist in?
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
Its basis is family life, and, so far as its livelihood is concerned,
the possession of land.  Its particular members attain their position
by birth, just as the monarch does, and, in common with him, they
possess a will which rests on itself alone.
</span>
</p><a id="073"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p95-->
The will which rests on itself alone is related to its livelihood,
i.e., the possession of land, to its position by birth which it
has in common with the monarch, and to family life, as its basis.
</p><a id="074"></a>
<p class="fst">
Livelihood as possession of land and a will which rests on itself
alone are two quite different things.  One should rather say a
will which rests on ground and soil.  One should rather speak
of a will resting on the disposition of the state, not of one
resting on itself but in the whole.  The possession of land takes
the place of the disposition, or the possession of political spirit.
</p><a id="075"></a>
<p class="fst">
Furthermore, in regard to family life as basis, the social
ethical life of civil society appears to occupy a higher position
than this natural ethical life.  Moreover, family life is the
natural ethical life of the other classes, of the civil as well
as the agricultural class of civil society.  But the fact that
'family life' is, in the case of the agricultural class, not only
the principle of the family but also the basis of this class'
social existence in general, seems to disqualify it for the highest
political task; for this class will apply patriarchal laws to
a non-patriarchal sphere, and will think and act in terms of child
or father, master and servant, where the real questions are the
political state and political citizenship.
</p><a id="076"></a>
<p class="fst">
Regarding the monarch's position by birth, Hegel has not developed
a patriarchal but rather a modern constitutional king.  His position
by birth consists in his being the bodily representative of the
state and in being born as king, or in the kingdom being his family
inheritance.  But what does this have in common with family life
as the basis of the agricultural class; and what does natural
ethical-life have in common with position by birth as such?  The
king has this in common with a horse, namely, just as the horse
is born a horse so the king is born a king.
</p><a id="077"></a>
<p class="fst">
Had Hegel made the class distinction, which he already accepted,
a political distinction, then the agricultural class as such would
already be an independent part of the Estates; and if it is
as such a moment of mediation with the principality, why would
the construction of a new mediation be necessary?  And why separate
it off from the actual moment of the Estates, since this moment
achieves its abstract position <i>vis-a-vis </i>the crown only
because of this separation?  After he has developed the political
Estates as a specific element, as a transubstantiation of the
unofficial class into state citizenship, and precisely because
of this has found the mediation to be a necessity, by what right
does Hegel dissolve this organism once more into the distinction
of the unofficial class, and thus into the unofficial class, and
then derive from it the political state's mediation with itself?
</p><a id="078"></a>
<p class="fst">
In any case, what an anomaly, that the highest synthesis of the
political state is nothing but the synthesis of landed property
and family life!
</p><a id="079"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p96-->
In a word:
</p><a id="080"></a>
<p class="fst">
If civil classes as such are political classes, then the mediation
is not needed; and if this mediation is needed, then the civil
class is not political, and thus also not this mediation.  The
member of the agricultural class is not as such, but as state
citizen, a part of the political Estates; while in the opposite
case (i.e., where he, as member of the agricultural class, is
state citizen, or as state citizen is member of this class), his
state citizenship is membership in the agricultural class; and
then he is not, as member of this class, a state citizen, but
is as state citizen a member of this class!
</p><a id="081"></a>
<p class="fst">
Here, then, we find one of Hegel's inconsistencies within his
own way of viewing things; and such an inconsistency is an accommodation.
 The political Estates in the modern sense, which is the sense
developed by Hegel, constitute the frilly established separation
of civil society from its unofficial class and its distinctions.
 How can Hegel make the unofficial class the solution of the antinomies
which the legislature has within itself?  Hegel wants the medieval
system of Estates, but in the modern sense of the legislature;
and he wants the modern legislature, but within the framework
of the medieval system of Estates!  This is syncretism at its
worst.
</p><a id="082"></a>
<p class="fst">
The beginning of § 304 reads:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
The Estates, as an element in political life, still retail). in
their own function the class distinctions already present in
the lower spheres of civil life.
</span>
</p><a id="083"></a>
<p class="fst">
But in their own function, the Estates, as an clement in political
life, retain this distinction only by annulling it, negating it
within themselves, abstracting themselves from it.
</p><a id="084"></a>
<p class="fst">
Should the agricultural class — or, as we will hear later, the
empowered agricultural class, aristocratic landed property — become
as such, and as described, the mediation of the total political
state, i.e., of the legislature within itself, then it is certainly
the mediation of the political Estates with the crown, in the
sense of being the dissolution of the political Estates as an
actual political clement.  Not the agricultural class, but class,
the unofficial class, the analysis (reduction) of the political
Estates into the unofficial class, constitutes here the re-established
unity of the political state with itself. (The mediation here
is not the agricultural class as such, but rather its separation
from the political Estates in its quality as civil unofficial
class; that is, its unofficial class [reality] gives it a separate
position within the political Estates, whereupon the other section
of the political Estates is also given the position of a particular
unofficial class, and, therefore, it ceases to represent the state
citizenship of civil society.) Here then, the political state
no longer exists as two opposed wills; rather, on the one side
stands the political state (the executive and the sovereign),
and on the other side stands civil society in its distinction
from the political state (the various classes).  With that, then,
the political state as a totality is abolished.
</p><a id="085"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p97-->
The other sense of the duplication of the political Estates within
themselves as a mediation with the crown is, in general, this:
the internal separation of the political Estates, their own inner
opposition, is a re-established unity with the crown.  The fundamental
dualism between the crown and the Estates as an element in the
legislature is neutralised by the dualism within the Estates themselves.
 With Hegel, however, this neutralisation is effected by the political
Estates separating themselves from their political element.
</p><a id="086"></a>
<p class="fst">
We will return later to the subject of possession of land as livelihood,
which is supposed to accord with sovereignty of Will, i.e., the
sovereignty of the crown, and to family life as the basis of the
agricultural class, which is supposed to accord with the position
by birth of the crown.  What is developed here in <a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PR305" target=_blank>§ 305</a>
is the principle of the agricultural class which is in itself
capable of adaptation to this political position.
</p><a id="087"></a>
<p class="fst">
<a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PR306" target=_blank>§ 306</a> deals with the adaption to political position
and significance; it reduces to the following: 'Their wealth becomes
inalienable, entailed, and burdened by primogeniture.  Thus, primogeniture
would be the adaption of the agricultural class to politics.
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
Primogeniture is grounded, </span>so it says in the Addition,
<span class="inote">on the fact that the state should be able to reckon not
on the bare possibility of political inclinations, but on something
necessary.  Now an inclination for politics is of course not bound
up with wealth, but there is a relatively necessary connection
between the two, because a man with independent means is not hemmed
in by external circumstances and so there is nothing to prevent
him from entering politics and working for the state.

</p><a id="089"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p98-->
In addition, Hegel has failed to show that possession of land
is the sole independent means.
</p><a id="090"></a>
<p class="fst">
The adaption of its means to independence is the adaption of the
agricultural class to political position and significance.  In
other words, independent means is its political position and significance.
</p><a id="091"></a>
<p class="fst">
This independence is further developed as follows:
</p><a id="092"></a>
<p class="fst">
Its wealth is independent of the state's capital.  'State's capital'
here apparently means the government treasury.  In this respect
the universal class, as essentially dependent on the state, stands
in opposition.
</p><a id="093"></a>
<p class="fst">
As it says in the <a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/preface.html#xxiv" target=_blank><b>Preface</b></a>:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
Apart from anything else philosophy with us is not, as it was
with the Greeks for instance, pursued in private like an art,
but has an existence in the open, in contact with the public,
and especially, or even only, in the service of the state.
</span>
</p><a id="094"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p99-->
Thus, philosophy is also essentially dependent upon the government
treasury.
</p><a id="095"></a>
<p class="fst">
Its ['the agricultural class'] wealth is independent of the uncertainty
of business, the quest for profit, and any sort of fluctuation
in possessions.  From this aspect it is opposed by the business
class as the one which is dependent on needs and concentrated
on their satisfaction.
</p><a id="096"></a>
<p class="fst">
This wealth is independent of favour, whether from the executive
or the mob.
</p><a id="097"></a>
<p class="fst">
Finally, it is even fortified against its own wilfulness, because
those members of this class who are called to political life are
not entitled, as other citizens are, either to dispose of their
entire property at will, or to the assurance that it will pass
to their children, whom they love equally, in similarly equal
divisions.
</p><a id="098"></a>
<p class="fst">
Here the oppositions have taken on an entirely new and materialistic
form such as we would hardly expect to find in the heaven of the
political state.
</p><a id="099"></a>
<p class="fst">
In sharpest terms, the opposition, as Hegel develops it, is the
opposition of private property and wealth.
</p><a id="100"></a>
<p class="fst">
The possession of land is private property <font face="symbol">kat exohin</font> true
private property.  Its exact private nature is prominent <b>(1)</b>
as independence from state capital, from favour from the executive,
from property existing as universal property of the political
state, a particular wealth which, alongside of other wealth, is
in accordance with the construction of the political state; <b>(2)</b>
as independence from the need of society or the social wealth,
from favour from the mob. (Equally significant is the fact that
a share in state capital is understood as favour from the executive just
as a share in the social wealth is understood as favour from the
mob.) Neither the wealth of the universal class nor that of the
business class is true private property, because such wealth is
occasioned, in the former case directly, in the latter case indirectly,
by the connection with the universal wealth, or property as social
property; both are a participation in it, and therefore both are
mediated through favour, that is, through the contingency of will.
 In opposition to that stands the possession of land as sovereign
private property, which has not yet acquired the form of wealth,
i.e., property established by the social will.
</p><a id="101"></a>
<p class="fst">
Thus, at its highest point the political constitution is the constitution
of private property.  The highest political inclination is the
inclination of private property. Primogeniture is merely the external
appearance of the internal nature of the possession of land.  Because it
is inalienable, its social nerves have been severed and- its isolation
from civil society is secured.  By not passing on to the children
whom they love equally, it is independent even of the smallest
society, the natural society, the family.  By having withdrawn
from the volition and laws of the family it thus safeguards its
rough nature of private property against the transition into family
wealth.
</p><a id="102"></a>
<p class="fst">
In <a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PR305" target=_blank>§ 305</a>, Hegel declared the class of landed property
to be capable of adaption to the political position because family
life would be its basis.  But he himself has declared love to
be the basis, the principle, the spirit of family life.  The class
whose basis is family life thus lacks the basis of family life,
i.e., love, as the actual and thus effective and determining principle.
 It is spiritless family life, the illusion of family life.  In
its highest form of development, the principle of private property
contradicts the principle of the family.  Family life in civil
society becomes family life, the life of love, only in opposition
to the class of natural ethical life, [which is, according to
Hegel] the class of family life.  This latter is, rather, the
barbarism of private property against family life.
</p><a id="103"></a>
<p class="fst">
This, then, would be the sovereign splendour of private property,
of possession of land, about which so many sentimentalities have
recently been uttered and on behalf of which so many multi-colored
crocodile tears have been shed.
It does not help Hegel to say that primogeniture would be merely
a requirement of politics and would have to be understood in its
political position and significance.  Neither does it help him
to say: 'The security and stability of the agricultural class
may be still further increased by the institution of primogeniture,
though this institution is desirable only from the point of view
of politics, since it entails a sacrifice for the political end
of giving the eldest son a life of independence. There is a certain
decency of mind in Hegel.  He does not want primogeniture in and
for itself, but only in reference to something else, not as something
self-determined but as something determined by another, not as
an end but as a means for justifying and constructing an end.
 In fact, primogeniture is a consequence of the exact possession
of land; it is petrified private property, private property (<i>quand
même</i>) in the highest independence and sharpness
of its development.  What Hegel presents as the end, the determining
factor, the <i>prima causa, </i>of primogeniture is, instead,
an effect, a consequence of the power of abstract private property
over the political state, while Hegel presents primogeniture as
the power of the political state over private property.  He makes
the cause the effect and the effect the cause, the determining
that which has been determined and that which has been determined
the determining.
</p><a id="104"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p100-->
What then is the content of political adaption, of the political
end: what is the end of this end, what is its substance?  Primogeniture,
the superlative of private property, sovereign private property.
 What kind of power does the political state exercise over private
property in primogeniture?  Does the state isolate it from the
family and society and bring it to its abstract autonomy?  What
then is the power of the political state over private property?
 Private property's own power, its essence brought to existence.
 What remains to the political state in opposition to this essence?
 The illusion that it determines when it is rather determined.
indeed, it breaks the will of the family and of society, but merely
in order to give existence to the will of private property lacking
family and society, and to acknowledge this existence as the highest
existence of the political state, as the highest ethical existence.
</p><a id="105"></a>
<p class="fst">
Let us consider the various elements as they relate here in the
legislature to the total state, the state having achieved actuality,
consistency, and consciousness, i.e., to the actual political
state in connection with the ideal or what ought be, with the
logical character and form of these elements.
</p><a id="106"></a>
<p class="fst">
(Primogeniture is not, as Hegel says, a chain on the freedom of
private rights; it is rather the freedom of private rights which
has freed itself from all social and ethical chains.) (The highest
political construction is the construction of abstract private
property.)
</p><a id="107"></a>
<p class="fst">
Before we make this comparison we should first consider more closely
one statement of the paragraph, namely, that because of primogeniture
the wealth of the agricultural class, possession of land, private
property, is even fortified against its own wilfulness, because
those members of this class who are called to political life are
not entitled, as other citizens are, to dispose of their entire
property at will'.
</p><a id="108"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p101-->
We have already indicated how the social nerves of private property
are severed because of the inalienability of landed property.
 Private property (landed property) is fortified against the owner's
own wilfulness by having the sphere of his wilfulness suddenly
changed from a universal human sphere into the specific wilfulness
of private property.  In other words, private property has become
the subject of the will, and the will is merely the predicate
of private property.  Private property is no longer a determined
object of wilfulness, but rather wilfulness is the determined
predicate of private property.  Yet let us compare this with what
Hegel himself says about the sphere of private rights:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
<a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/property.html#PR65" target=_blank>§ 65.</a> The reason I can alienate my property is that
it is mine only in so far as I put my will into it ... provided
always that the thing in question is a thing external by nature.
</span>
</p><a id="109"></a>
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
<a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/property.html#PR65" target=_blank>§ 66.</a>  Therefore those goods, or rather substantive
characteristics, which constitute my own private personality and
the universal essence of my self-consciousness are inalienable
and my right to them is imprescriptible.  Such characteristics
are my personality as such, my universal freedom of will, my ethical
life, my religion.
</span>
</p><a id="110"></a>
<p class="fst">
Therefore in primogeniture landed property, exact private property,
becomes an inalienable good, thus a substantive characteristic
which constitutes the very private personality and universal essence
of self-consciousness of the class of noble entailed estates,
its personality as such, its universal freedom of will, its ethical
life, its religion.  Thus it is also consistent to say that where
private property, landed property, is inalienable, universal freedom
of will (to which also belongs free disposition of something alienable,
like landed property) and ethical life (to which also belongs
love as the actual spirit of the family, the spirit which is also
identified with the actual law of the family) are alienable. in
general then, the inalienability of private property is the alienability
of universal freedom of will and ethical life.  Here it is no
longer the case that property is in so far as I put my will into
it, but rather my will is in so far as it is in property.  Here
my will does not own but is owned.  This is precisely the romantic
itch of the nobility of primogeniture, namely, that here private
property, and thus private wilfulness in its most abstract form
- the totally ignorant, unethical, crude will — appears to be
the highest synthesis of the political state, the highest renunciation
of wilfulness, the hardest and most self-sacrificing struggle
with human weakness; for what appears here to be human weakness
is actually the humanising, the humanisation of private property.
</p><a id="111"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p102-->
Primogeniture is private property which has become a religion
for itself, which has become absorbed in itself, enchanted with
its autonomy and nobility. Just as primogeniture is derived from
direct alienation, so too it is derived from the contract.  Hegel
presents the transition from property to contract in the following
manner:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
<a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/property.html#PR65" target=_blank>§ 71</a>.  Existence as determinate being is in essence
being for another;...  One aspect of property is that it is an
existent as an external thing, and in this respect property exists
for other external things and is connected with their necessity
and contingency.  But it is also an existent as an embodiment
of will, and from this point of view the 'other' for which it
exists can only be the will of another person.  This relation
of will to will is the true and proper ground in which freedom
is existent.  — The sphere of contract is made up of this mediation
whereby I hold property not merely by means of a thing and my
subjective will but by means of another person's will as well
and so hold it in virtue of my participation in a common will.
</span>
</p><a id="112"></a>
<p class="fst">
(In primogeniture it has been made a state law to hold property
not in one common will, but merely by means of a thing and my
subjective will.) While Hegel here perceives in private rights
the alienability and dependence of private property on a common
will as its true idealism, in state rights, on the other hand,
he praises the imaginary nobility of independent property as opposed
to the uncertainty of business, the quest for profit, any sort
of fluctuation in possessions, and dependence on the state's capital.
 What kind of state is this that cannot even tolerate the idealism
of private rights?  And what kind of philosophy of right is this
in which the independence of private property has diverse meanings
in the spheres of private and state rights?
</p><a id="113"></a>
<p class="fst">
Over against the crude stupidity of independent private property,
the uncertainty of business is elegiac, the quest for profit solemn
(dramatic), fluctuation in possessions a serious fatum (tragic),
dependence on the state's capital ethical.  In short, in all of
these qualities the human heart pulses throughout the property,
which is the dependence of man on man.  No matter how it may be
constituted it is human toward the slave who believes himself
to be free, because the sphere that limits him is not society
but the soil.  The freedom of this will is its emptiness of content
other than that of private property.
</p><a id="114"></a>
<p class="fst">
To define monstrosities like primogeniture as a determination
of private property by the state is absolutely unavoidable if
one interprets an old world view in terms of a new one, if one
attributes to a thing, as in this case to private property, a
double meaning, one in the court of abstract right and an opposed
one in the heaven of the political state.
</p><a id="115"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p103-->
Now we come to the comparison mentioned earlier. <a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate.html#PR257" target=_blank>§ 257</a>
says:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
The state is the actuality of the ethical Idea.  It is ethical
mind <i>qua </i>the substantial will manifest and revealed to
itself.. The state exists immediately in custom, mediately
in individual self-consciousness ... while self-consciousness
in virtue of its sentiment towards the state finds in the state,
as its essence and the end and product of its activity, its substantive
freedom.
</span>
</p><a id="116"></a>
<p class="fst">
<a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate.html#PR268" target=_blank>§ 268</a> says:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
The political sentiment, patriotism pure and simple, is assured
conviction with truth as its basis... and a volition which has
become habitual.  In this sense it is simply a product of the
institutions subsisting in the state, since rationality is actually
present in the state, while action in conformity with these institutions
gives rationality its practical proof.  This sentiment is, in
general, trust (which may pass over into a greater or lesser degree
of educated insight), or the consciousness that my interest, both
substantive and particular, is contained and preserved in another's
(i.e., in the state's) interest and end, i.e., in the other's
relation to me as an individual.  In this way, this very other
is immediately not another in my eyes, and in being conscious
of this fact I am free.
</span>
</p><a id="117"></a>
<p class="fst">
Here, the actuality of the ethical Idea appears as the religion
of private property (because in primogeniture private property
relates to itself in a religious manner, so it happens that in
our modem times religion in general has become a quality inherent
in landed property, and that all of the writings on the nobility
of primogeniture are full of religious unction.  Religion is the
highest thought form of this brutality.) The substantial will
manifest and revealed to itself changes into a will dark and broken
on the soil, a will enraptured precisely with the impenetrability
of the element to which it is attached.  The assured conviction
with truth as its basis, which is political sentiment, is the
conviction standing on 'its own ground' (in the literal sense).
 The political volition which has become habitual no longer remains
simply a product [of the institutions subsisting in the state],
but rather an institution subsisting outside the state.  The political
sentiment is no longer trust but rather the reliance, the consciousness
that my interest, both substantive and particular, is independent
of another's (i.e., the state's) interest and end, i.e., in the
other's relation to me as an individual.  This is the consciousness
of my freedom from the state.

<p class="fst">
The maintenance of the state's universal interest etc. was (<a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PR289" target=_blank><b>§
289</b></a>) the task of the executive.  In it resided the consciousness of right and the developed intelligence of the mass of the people (<a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PR297" target=_blank>§ 297</a>).  It actually makes the Estates superfluous, for even without the Estates they [i.e., the highest civil servants] are able to do what is best, just as they also continually have to do while the Estates are in session (Remark to § 301).  The universal class, or, more precisely, the class of civil servants, must, purely in virtue of its character as universal, have the
universal as the end of its essential activity [<a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PR303" target=_blank>§ 303</a>].
</p><a id="119"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p104-->
And how does the universal class, the executive, appear now? As essentially dependent upon the state, as wealth dependent upon the favour of the executive.  The very same transformation has
occurred within civil society, which earlier achieved its ethical life in the Corporation.  It is a wealth dependent upon the uncertainty of business etc., upon the favour of the mob.
</p><a id="120"></a>
<p class="fst">
What then is the quality which ostensibly specifies the owners of entailed estates?  And what, in any case, constitutes the ethical quality of an inalienable wealth?  Incorruptibility.  Incorruptibility appears to be the highest political virtue, an abstract virtue.  Yet, incorruptibility in the state as constructed by Hegel is something so uncommon that it has to be built up into a particular political power; which precisely proves, that incorruptibility
is not the spirit of the political state, not the rule but the exception, and is constructed as such.  The owners of entailed estates are corrupted by their independent property in order that they be preserved from corruption.  While according to the idea dependence upon the state and the feeling of this dependence is supposed to be the highest political freedom, here the independent private person is constructed; because political freedom is the private person's feeling of being an abstract, dependent person, whereas he feels and should feel independent only as a citizen.  Its capital is independent alike of the state's capital, the uncertainty of business, etc.  In opposition to it stands the business class, which is dependent on needs and concentrated on their satisfaction, and the civil servant class, which is essentially 
dependent upon the state.  Here, therefore, independence from the state and civil society and this actualised abstraction of both, which in reality is the crudest dependence on the soil,
forms in the legislature the mediation and the unity of both.  Independent private wealth, i.e., abstract private wealth and the corresponding private person, are the highest political construction of the state.  Political independence is constructed as independent private property and the person of this independent private property.  We shall see in the following paragraph what the situation is <i>re vera </i>regarding this independence and incorruptibility, and the political sentiment arising from them.

The fact that primogeniture is inherited, or entailed wealth
speaks for itself.  More about this later.  The fact that it
accrues to the first-born is, as Hegel notes in the Addition,
purely historical.
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
<a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PR307" target=_blank>§ 307</a>.  The right of this section of the agricultural
class is thus based in a way on the natural principle of the family.
 But this principle is at the same time reversed owing to hard
sacrifices made for political ends, and thereby the activity of
this class is essentially directed to those ends.  As a consequence
of this, this class is summoned and entitled to its political
vocation by birth without the hazards of election.

<p class="fst">
Hegel has failed to develop the way in which the right of this
agricultural class is based on the natural principle of the family,
unless by this he understands that landed property exists as entailed
or inherited wealth.  That, however, establishes no right of this
class in the political sense, but only the birthright of the owners
of entailed estates to landed property.  'This', i.e., the natural
principle of the family, is 'at the same time reversed owing to
hard sacrifices made for political ends'.  We have certainly seen
how the natural principle of the family is reversed; this, however,
is no hard sacrifice made for political ends, but rather the actualised
abstraction of private property.  But with this reversal of the
natural principle of the family the political ends are likewise
reversed, 'thereby (?) the activity of this class is essentially
directed to those ends' — because private property received independence?
- and 'as a consequence of this, this class is summoned and entitled
to its political vocation by birth without the hazards of election'.
</p><a id="123"></a>
<p class="fst">
Here then participation in the legislature is an innate human
right.  Here we have born legislators, i.e., born mediation of
the political state with itself. innate human rights have been
mocked, especially on behalf of the owners of entailed estates.
 Isn't it even more humorous that one particular group of men
is entrusted with the right to the highest honour, the legislature?
 In Hegel's treatment of the summons to the legislator, to the
representative of state citizenship, there is nothing more ridiculous
than his opposing summons by birth to summons by the hazards of
election.  As if election, the conscious product of civil trust,
would not stand in a completely different necessary connection
with the political ends than does the physical accident of birth.
 Hegel everywhere falls from his political spiritualism into the
crassest materialism.  At the summit of the political state it
is always birth that makes determinate individuals into embodiments
of the highest political tasks.  The highest political activities
coincide with individuals by reason of birth, Just like an animal's
position, character, way of life, etc. are immediately inborn.
in its highest functions the state acquires an animal actuality.
 Nature takes revenge on Hegel for the disdain he showed it. 
If matter is supposed to constitute no longer anything for itself
over against the human will, the human will no longer retains
anything for itself except the matter.
</p><a id="124"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p106-->
The false identity, the fragmentary and sporadic identity of nature
and spirit, body and soul, appears as incarnation.  Since birth
gives man only an individual existence and establishes him merely
as a natural individual, and since the functions of the state
- as for instance the legislature, etc. are social products, i.e.,
births of society and not procreations of the natural individual,
then what is striking and miraculous is precisely the immediate
identity, the sudden coincidence, of the individual's birth with
the individual as individuation of a certain social position,
function, etc.  —  In this system, nature immediately creates
kings, peers, etc. just as it creates eyes and noses.  What is
striking is to see as immediate product of the physical species
what is only the product of the self-conscious species.  I am
man by birth, without the agreement of society; yet only through
universal agreement does this determinate birth become peer or
king.  Only the agreement makes the birth of this man the birth
of a king.  It is therefore the agreement, not birth, that makes
the king.  If birth, in distinction from other determinations,
immediately endows man with a position, then his body makes him
this determined social functionary.  His body is his social right.
 In this system, the physical dignity of man, or the dignity of
the human body (with further elaboration, meaning: the dignity
of the physical natural element of the state), appears in such
a form that determinate dignities, specifically the highest social
dignities, are the dignities of certain bodies which are determined
and predestined by birth to be such.  This is, of course, why
we find in the aristocracy such pride in blood and descent, in
short, in the life history of their body.  It is this zoological
point of view which has its corresponding science in heraldry.
 The secret of aristocracy is zoology.

<p class="fst">
Two moments in hereditary primogeniture are to be stressed:</p>
<p class="indent-list">
1. That which is permanent is entailed wealth, landed property.
 This is the preserving moment in the relation — the substance.
 The master of the entailed estate, the owner, is really a mere
accident.  Landed property anthropomorphises itself in the various
generations.  Landed property always inherits, as it were, the
first born of the house as an attribute linked to it.  Every first
born in the line of land owners is the inheritance, the property,
of the inalienable landed property, which is the predestined substance
of his will and activity.  The subject is the thing and the predicate
is the man.  The will becomes the property of the property.
</p>
<p class="indent-list">
2. The political quality of the owner of the entailed estate
is the political quality of his inherited wealth, a political
quality inhering in his inherited wealth.  Here, therefore, the
political quality appears also as the property of landed property,
as a quality which is ascribed directly to the bare physical earth
(nature).</p>
<a id="126"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p107-->
Regarding the first point, it follows that the owner of the entailed
estate is the serf of the landed property, and that in the serfs
who are subordinated to him there appears only the practical consequence
of the theoretical relationship with landed property in which
he himself stands.  The depth of German subjectivity appears everywhere
as the crudity of a mindless objectivity.
</p><a id="127"></a>
<p class="fst">
Here we must analyse <b>(1)</b> the relation between
private property and inheritance, <b>(2)</b> the relation
between private property, inheritance, and, thereby, the privilege
of certain generations to participate in political sovereignty,
<b>(3)</b> the actual historical relation, or the Germanic
relation.
</p><a id="128"></a>
<p class="fst">
We have seen that primogeniture is the abstraction of independent
private property.  A second consequence follows from this.  Independence,
autonomy, in the political state whose construction we have followed
so far, is private property, which at its peak appears as inalienable
landed property.  Political independence thus flows not <i>ex
proprio sinu </i>of the political state; it is not a gift of the
political state to its members, nor is it the animating spirit
[of the political state].  Rather, the members of the political
state receive their independence from a being which is not the
being of the political state, from a being of abstract private
right, namely, from abstract private property.  Political independence
is an accident of private property and not the substance of the
political state.  The political state — and within it the legislature,
as we have seen — is the unveiled mystery of the true value and
essence of the moments of the state.  The significance that private
property has in the political state is its essential, its true
significance; the significance that class distinction has in the
political state is the essential significance of class distinction.
 In the same way, the essence of the sovereign and of the executive
come to appearance in the legislature.  It is here, in the sphere
of the political state, that the individual moments of the state
relate to themselves as to the being of the species, the 'species-being';
because the political state is the sphere of their universal character,
i.e., their religious sphere.  The political state is the mirror
of truth for the various moments of the concrete state.
</p><a id="129"></a>
<p class="fst">
Thus, if independent private property in the political state,
in the legislature, has the significance of political independence,
then it is the political independence of the state.  Independent
private property, or actual private property is then not only
the support of the constitution but the constitution itself. 
And isn't the support of the constitution nothing other than the
constitution of constitutions, the primary, the actual constitution?

Hegel himself was surprised about the immanent development of  science, the derivation of its entire content from the concept in its simplicity (<a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate1.html#PRn279" target=_blank><b>Remark to § 279</b></a>), when he was constructing the hereditary monarch, and made the following remark:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">
Hence it is the basic moment of personality, abstract at the start in immediate rights, which has matured itself through its various forms of subjectivity, and now — at the stage of absolute rights, of the state, of the completely concrete objectivity of the will  — has become the personality of the state, its certainty of itself. 
</span>
</p><a id="131"></a>
<p class="fst">
That is, in the political state it comes to appearance that abstract
personality is the highest political personality, the political
basis of the entire state.  Likewise, in primogeniture, the right
of this abstract personality, its objectivity, abstract private
property, comes into existence as the highest objectivity of the
state, i.e., as its highest right.
</p><a id="132"></a>
<p class="fst">
The state is hereditary monarch; abstract personality means nothing
other than that the personality of the state is abstract, or that
it is the state of abstract personality, just as the Romans developed
the rights of the monarch purely within the norms of private rights,
or private rights as the highest norm of state, or political rights.
</p><a id="133"></a>
<p class="fst">
The Romans are the rationalists, the Germans the mystics of sovereign
private property.
</p><a id="134"></a>
<p class="fst">
Hegel calls private rights the rights of abstract personality,
or abstract rights.  And indeed they have to be developed as the
abstraction, and thus the illusory rights, of abstract personality,
just as the moral doctrine developed by Hegel is the illusory
existence of abstract subjectivity.  Hegel develops private rights
and morals as such abstractions, from which it does not follow,
for him, that the state or ethical life of which they are the
presuppositions can be nothing but the society (the social life)
of these illusions; rather, he concludes that they are subalternate
moments of this ethical life.  But what are private rights except
the rights of these subjects of the state, and what is morality
except their morality?  In other words, the person of private
rights and the subject of morals are the person and the subject
of the state.  Hegel has been widely criticised for his development
of morality.  He has done nothing but develop the morality of
the modern state and modern private rights.  A more complete separation
of morality from the state, its fuller emancipation, was desired.
 What did that prove except that the separation of the present-day
state from morals is moral, that morals are non-political and
that the state is not moral?  It is rather a great, though from
one aspect (namely, from the aspect that Hegel declares the state,
whose presupposition is such a morality, to be the realistic idea
of ethical life) an unconscious service of Hegel to have assigned
to modem morality its true position.

In the constitution, wherein primogeniture is a guarantee, private
property is the guarantee of the political constitution.  In primogeniture,
it appears that this guarantee is a particular kind of private
property.  Primogeniture is merely a particular existence of the
universal relationship of private property and the political state.
 Primogeniture is the political sense of private property, private
property in its political significance, that is to say, in its
universal significance.  Thus the constitution here is the constitution
of private property.
</p><a id="136"></a>
<p class="fst">
With the Germanic peoples, where we encounter primogeniture in
its classical formation, we also find the constitution of private
property.  Private property is a universal category, the universal
bond of the state.  Even the universal functions appear as the
private property sometimes of a Corporation, sometimes of an estate.
</p><a id="137"></a>
<p class="fst">
Trade and business in their particular nuances were the private
property of particular Corporations.  Royal offices, jurisdiction,
etc., were the private property of particular estates.  The various
provinces were the private property of individual princes etc.
 Service for the realm was the private property of the ruler.
 The spirit was the private property of the spiritual authority.'
One's loyal activity was the private property of another, just
as one's right was, once again, a particular private property.
 Sovereignty, here nationality, was the private property of the
Emperor.
</p><a id="138"></a>
<p class="fst">
It has often been said that in the Middle Ages every form of right,
of freedom, of social existence, appears as a privilege, an exception
from the rule.  The empirical fact that all these privileges appear
in the form of private property could thus not have been overlooked.
 What is the universal reason for this coincidence?  Private property
is the species-existence of privilege, of right as an exception.
</p><a id="139"></a>
<p class="fst">
Where the sovereigns, as in France for instance, attacked the
independence of private property, they directed their attention
more to the property of the Corporations than to that of individuals.
 But in attacking the private property of the Corporations they
attacked private property as Corporations, i.e., as the social
bond.
</p><a id="140"></a>
<p class="fst">
In the feudal reign it almost appears that the power of the crown
is the power of private property, and that the mystery of the
nature of the universal power, the power of all spheres of the
state, is deposited in the sovereign.
</p><a id="141"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p110-->
(The powerfulness of the state is expressed in the sovereign as
the representative of the power of the state.  The constitutional
sovereign, therefore, expresses the idea of the constitutional
state in its sharpest abstraction.  On the one hand he is the
idea of the state, the sanctified majesty of the state, and precisely
as <i><b>this</b> </i>person.  At the same time he is a pure imagination;
as person and as sovereign he has neither actual power nor actual
function.  Here, the separation of the political and the actual,
the formal and the material, the universal and the particular
person, Of man and social man, is expressed in its highest contradiction.)

<p class="fst">
Private property is a child of Roman intellect and Germanic heart.  At this point it will be valuable to undertake a comparison of these two extreme developments.  This will help solve the political problem as discussed.</p>
<hr class="end"/>
<a id="143"></a>
<p class="fst">
The Romans were the first to have formulated the right of private
property, i.e., the abstract right, the private right, the right
of the abstract person.  The Roman conception of private right
is private right in its classical formulation.  Yet nowhere with
the Romans do we find that the right of private property was mystified
as in the case of the Germans.  Nowhere does it become right of
the state.
</p><a id="144"></a>
<p class="fst">
The right of private property is <i>jus utendi et abutendi, </i>the
right of wilfulness in disposing of a thing.  The main interest
of the Romans lay in developing the relationships, and in determining
which ones resulted in abstract relations of private property.
 The actual basis of private property, the property, is a <i>factum,
</i>an unexplainable factum, and no right.  Only through
legal determinations, which the society attributes to the factual
property, does it receive the quality of rightful property, private
property.
</p><a id="145"></a>
<p class="fst">
Regarding the connection between the political constitution and
private property with the Romans, it appears that:</p>
<p class="indent-list">
1. Man (as slave), as is generally the case with ancient peoples,
is the object of private property.<br>
This is nothing specific.
</p>
<p class="indent-list">
2. Conquered countries are treated as private property, <i>jus
utendi et abutendi </i>being asserted in their case.
</p>
<p class="indent-list">
3. In their history itself, there appears the struggle between
the poor and the rich (Patricians and Plebians) etc.
</p><a id="146"></a>
<p class="fst">
In other respects, private property as a whole, as with the ancient
classical peoples in general, is asserted to be public property,
either as the republic's expenditure — as in good times — or as
luxurious and universal benefaction (baths, etc.) towards the
mob.
</p><a id="147"></a>
<p class="fst"><!--p111-->
Slavery finds its explanation in the rights of war, the rights
of occupation: men are slaves precisely because their political
existence is destroyed.
</p><a id="148"></a>
<p class="fst">
We especially stress two relationships in distinction from the
Germans.
<p class="indent-list">
1. The imperial power was not the power of private property,
but rather the sovereignty of the empirical will as such, which
was far from regarding private property as the bond between itself
and its subjects; on the contrary, it dealt with private property
as it did with all other social goods.  The imperial power, therefore,
was nothing other than factually hereditary.  The highest formation
of the right of private property, of private right, indeed belongs
to the imperial epoch; however, it is a consequence of the political
dissolution rather than the political dissolution being a consequence
of private property.  Furthermore, when private right achieved
full development in Rome, state right was abolished, [or] was
in the process of its dissolution, while in Germany the opposite
was the case.
</p>
<p class="indent-list">
2. In Rome, state honours are never hereditary; that is to say,
private property is not the dominant category of the state.
</p>
<p class="indent-list">
3. Contrary to German primogeniture etc., in Rome the wilfulness
of the testator appears to be the derivative of private property.
 In this latter antithesis lies the entire difference between
the German and the Roman development of private property.
</p><a id="149"></a>
<p class="fst">
(In primogeniture it appears that private property is the relationship
to the function of the state which is such that the existence
of the state is something inhering in, or is an accident of, direct
private property, i.e., landed property.  At its highest levels
the state appears as private property, whereas private property
should appear as property of the state.  Instead of making private
property a civil quality, Hegel makes political citizenship, existence,
and sentiment a quality of private property.)

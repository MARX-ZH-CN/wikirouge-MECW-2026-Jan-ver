<h2>The <i>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</i> As Grand Inquisitor</h2>
<hr class="end"/><p class="information"><span class="info">Source</span>: MECW Volume 1, p. 370<br>

<p class="fst"><strong>Cologne, March 11</strong>. A few days ago the <i>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</i> published a bull of excommunication against the pious <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i>. Today the <i>Trier’sche Zeitung</i> stands before the court of inquisition in Koblenz, and rightly so.</p>
<p class="fst">For, in connection with Friedrich von Sallet, the <i>Trier’sche Zeitung</i> says among other things</p>
<p class="quoteb">“We have before us his book, the <i>Laien-Evangelium, which without falsification reveals for us the holy, eternal truths of the gospel</i>”.<i> “</i>He” (Sallet) “endeavoured to be a man in the highest sense, following the example given by Jesus, and, <i>as the true</i> <i>champion of the Lord, revealed eternal truth</i>”.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Anyone who reads that”. says the <i>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</i>, “and knows nothing more about this man who is given such high praise, would he not believe that Herr von Sallet must have been a faithful Christian and in his <i>Laien-Evangelium</i> must have preached the Lord’s word with fiery zeal? But what in truth is the content of this gospel? It is that false and pernicious doctrine which a Strauss, a Feuerbach, a Bruno Bauer, and all the apostles of modem paganism, whatever their names are, expound in lecture-rooms and in their writings for a narrow circle of learned people and so on”.</p>
<p class="fst">As an authentic proof of its assertion, the <i>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</i> quotes</p>
<p class="quoteb">“a passage from this <i>Laien-Evangelium</i>, namely, that in which a parallel is drawn between the traitor Judas and the Christ of the gospels, i.e., Christ as depicted in the Bible”.</p>
<p class="fst">The proofs cited strikingly demonstrate Sallet’s attitude of deliberate opposition to <i>historical</i> Christianity.</p>
<p>A mistaken feeling of humanity may be offended by the ruthless polemic of the <i>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</i> against a man who has only just died, but is not the apologia of the <i>Trier’sche Zeitung </i>more inhuman, and equally offensive? Do I honour the deceased by giving a <i>false</i> account of his spiritual personality? Sallet indeed endeavoured to reveal truth, but by no means the truth of the gospel. Sallet certainly endeavoured to be a <i>true</i> human being, but by no means a champion of ecclesiastical truth.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Sallet believed that he could make rational truth effective only in opposition to holy truth, and that he could make the moral human being effective only in opposition to the Christian human being, and that is why he wrote his <i>Laien-Evangelium</i>. And what happened? Did the <i>Trier’sche Zeitung’s</i> apologist honour the man when he turned all his efforts upside down? Would it be an honour for Luther if one said he was a good Catholic, or for Pope Ganganelli if one called him a Maecenas for the Jesuits? What hypocrisy! What weakness! Sallet was a republican; can you be his friend if you make a great show of declaring his royalism? Sallet loved truth above all; do you believe there is no better way to pay homage to him than by an untruth? Or are Christianity and friendship at odds in your person? All right! Admit it then, and say: Sallet was a good man, etc., but a bad Christian! Deplore that, if you like, deplore it publicly, but do not pretend that his works are an illuminating testimony to his Christianity. If you <i>condemn</i> what your friend strove for, then condemn it <i>sans-gêne</i> as the <i>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</i> does, but not in a hypocritical, devious way, not by praising him for being what he was not, and therefore rejecting precisely what he <i>really</i> was.</p>
<p>Even if we admit that the <i>Laien-Evangelium</i> itself could give rise to such a conception, that Sallet <i>here</i> has by no means got things clear in his own mind, that he himself <i>believes </i>he is teaching the true meaning of the gospel, and that it is easy to counterpose quite Christian-sounding contradictory excerpts to the quotation given by the <i>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</i>, that newspaper is still correct in claiming that he puts forward a <i>self-made</i> Christianity instead of <i>historical</i> Christianity.</p>
<p>Finally, a few words more on the passages quoted by the <i>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</i>! They suffer from a fundamental defect, that of being <i>unpoetical</i>. And what an altogether mistaken idea it is to want to treat theological controversies poetically! Has it ever occurred to a composer to set dogma to music?</p>
<p>Leaving aside this heresy against art, what is the content of the passage quoted? <i>Sallet</i> finds it <i>incompatible</i> with the divinity of Christ that Christ knows the treacherous intention of Judas and does not attempt to reform him or to frustrate the crime. Hence Sallet exclaims (as cited by the <i>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</i>):</p>
<p class="quoteb">Woe to whoever — in dazzled delusion — <br>
Contrived to invent such traits of the Lord,<br>
And caricatured him to let him retain<br>
This morsel of knowledge of man’s human nature.'</p>
<p class="fst">Sallet’s verdict testifies to the fact that he was neither a <i>theologian</i> nor a <i>philosopher. </i>As a theologian he could not have been disturbed by the contradiction with <i>human</i> reason and morality, for the theologian does not judge the gospel by human reason and morality; on the contrary, he judges these by the gospel. On the other hand, as a <i>philosopher </i>he would have regarded such contradictions in the <i>nature</i> <i>of religious thought </i>as well founded, and therefore he would have conceived the contradiction as a <i>necessary product</i> of the Christian outlook and would by no means have condemned it as a <i>falsification</i> <i>of the latter.</i></p>
<p class="fst">May the <i>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</i> vigorously continue its work of faith and clothe all and sundry Rhenish newspapers in the <i>sanbenito</i>. We shall see whether the <i>half-and-half</i>, lukewarm ones, who are neither hot nor cold, will get on better with the <i>terrorism of faith</i> than with the <i>terrorism of reason</i>.</p>

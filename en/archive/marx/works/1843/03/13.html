<p class="fst"><strong>Cologne, March 13</strong>. The <i>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</i> has replied today 146 to our article of March 9 on the deputies to the Provincial Assembly a We do not want to hold back from our readers some samples. of this masterpiece of <i>style</i>. Among other delicacies is the following:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Thus in far-reaching strokes, not it is true with a halberd, but with its <i>accustomed cudge</i>l the <i>Rhein. Ztg</i>. has let fly at a spectre” (just think! <i>An accustomed cudgel! To let fly in strokes with a cudgel</i>!)"which it believed it perceived in an article of the <i>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</i>, and as is self-evident” (what a luxury, to expend words on things that are self-evident!) “all its strokes fell wide” <i>(fell wide</i>! wide of the <i>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</i>, perhaps on its editor!), “and the <i>attacked</i>” (the spectre was indeed only attacked!) “newspaper finds itself quite unhurt and intact”.</p>
<p class="fst">What generous logic, which does not leave to the sagacity of its readers even the conclusion that strokes which fell <i>wide</i> of the attacked newspaper did not fall <i>on</i> the attacked newspaper! What luxury of understanding, what a thoroughgoing narration Only it should be mentioned how interesting it must have seemed to the <i>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</i> to proclaim that its back was intact. How the imagination of the <i>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</i> is preoccupied with its splendid idea of the “spectre” and the <i>Rhein. Ztg</i>. letting fly at it, and of the cudgel-blows that fell wide, can be demonstrated by the following variations, as ingenious as they are surprising, on this superlative theme. In enumerating them, we will not fail to call attention to their fine nuances and shades. Thus:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><strong>1.</strong> “ In far-reaching strokes with its accustomed cudgel, the <i>Rhein. Ztg</i>. of March 9 has thus let fly at a <i>spectre</i> which it believed it perceived in an article of the <i>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</i>, and as is self-evident all its strokes fell wide”.</p>
<p class="quoteb"><strong>2.</strong> “But the article which made the <i>Rhein. Ztg</i>. a <i>spirit-seer</i> (previously the spirit was a spectre, and since when could the <i>Rhein. Ztg</i>. have detected any spirit in the obscure ultramontane paper?) “and consequently a heroine fighting a <i>shadow</i>”.</p>
<p class="fst">So this time the shadow of the <i>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</i> at least is said to have been hit!</p>
<p class="quoteb"><strong>3.</strong> “The <i>Rhein. Ztg</i>., however, which is certainly aware also that in respect of everything <i>substantial</i>, true and <i>solid</i>” (the <i>back</i> of the <i>Rhein- und Mosel Zeitung</i>?) “its powers become a laughing-stock” (and what spiritual power would not become a laughing-stock in respect of a back?), “and which nevertheless for once wants to show that it has <i>horns</i>” (the “accustomed cudgel” has mysteriously turned into “horns") “and can butt” (previously, let fly in far-reaching strokes), “has <i>thought up</i>” (previously “seen” or “<i>believed it has seen</i>") “a spectre which it would like to have regarded as the real spirit of our article” (a repetition to remind the reader of the facts of the matter!), “and against which it vents its anger to its heart’s content and tests its strength” (a clever rhetorical performance), “just as in a bull-baiting the <i>baited beast</i>” (somewhat earlier the <i>Rh. Ztg. </i>was “the man with the cudgel”, so surely the <i>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</i> is the “beast") “vents its anger on a straw figure thrown to it, and considers itself the victor when it has torn it to pieces”.</p>
<p class="fst">It is truly Homeric! just think of its epic amplitude. And how Aesopian, too, this profound insight into animal psychology! This subtle interpretation of the mental state of a bull that <i>considers</i> itself the victor!</p>
<p>It would be “very childish and ingenuous” and no less “insipid and trivial” to want to discuss the subject itself with such an “eminent publicist”. therefore we shall only add the following for a characterisation of the man.</p>
<p>In its article which was so unfortunately attacked, the <i>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</i> “<i>merely</i>” expressed “doubt” “whether the attainment of their” (i.e., of the originators of the circular on the election of Herr Camphausen and Herr Merkens) “hopes <i>would really bring back the period of the old Hansa</i>”,<i> </i>but there was in its “article no talk” of “a return to obsolete and decayed conditions”. Let him who can, understand that!</p>
<p>Further:</p>
<p>The <i>Rhein. Ztg</i>. tried to “put forward an obvious lie in saying: ‘Among the interests to be represented in the Provincial Assembly, the <i>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung.</i> mentions only a freer political system of local government and an extension of the rights of the estates’ whereas one can read in the <i>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</i> the addition: ‘<i>the disclosure of so many other undecided questions in the development of the people’s life</i>’.” </p>
<p>Has then the <i>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</i> formulated or even <i>mentioned</i> a single one of these “undecided questions"? Does it believe that such vague indecisive phrases as “disclosure of <i>many</i> <i>other undecided questions</i>” could serve as an equivalent of <i>naming</i> these questions for a definite demand to the deputies of the Provincial Assembly? And now let our readers take one more look at the originality of style of the <i>Rhein- und Mosel-Zeitung</i>:</p>
<p class="quoteb">Among “the <i>interests</i> to be represented in it” (i.e., in the Provincial Assembly) is “the <i>disclosure</i> of so many undecided questions in the development of the people’s life"!</p>
<p class="fst">An undecided question in the development of the people’s life! A disclosure to be represented!</p>

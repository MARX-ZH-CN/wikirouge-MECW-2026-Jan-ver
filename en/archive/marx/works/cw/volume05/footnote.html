<h1>Notes</h1>
<a id="1"></a>
<p class="fst">
<span class="term">1</span> The “Theses on Feuerbach” were written by Karl Marx in Brussels, probably in April 1845. They are to be found in Marx’s notebook of 1844-47 under the heading “1) ad Feuerbach”. They were published by Engels in the Appendix to the 1888 edition of his work Ludwig Feuerbach and <i>the </i>End <i>of Classical </i>German <i>Philosophy. </i>In the foreword to this edition Engels called this important theoretical document “Theses on Feuerbach”, hence the title. To render the brief notes, which Marx had not intended for publication, more comprehensible to the reader, Engels made a number of editorial changes when preparing the “Theses” for the press. Both versions of the “Theses” — i.e., Marx’s original text and that edited by Engels — have been included in this volume. The original text was first published in German and Russian in 1924 by the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U., Moscow <i>(Marx-Engels Archives, </i>Book 1); in English it was published in Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, <i>The German Ideology,</i> <i>Parts</i> I <i>&amp; </i>III, Lawrence and Wishart Ltd., London, 1938. The first English translation of the edited version was published in the Appendix to Frederick Engels, <i>Feuerbach. The Roots of the Socialist Philosophy, </i>Chicago, 1903.</p>

<span class="term">3</span> These notes were evidently intended by Engels for Chapter 1 of the first volume of <i>The German Ideology</i>. They were first published in the language of the original by the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U. in 1932 <i>(Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe</i>, Erste Abteilung, Band 5); in English they were published for the first time in Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, <i>The German Ideology</i>, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1964.</p>

<span class="term">5</span> This item, which was published anonymously, is the reply of the authors of <i>The Holy Family</i> to the anti-critique contained in Bruno Bauer’s article “Charakteristik Ludwig Feuerbachs” published in Wigand’s <i>Vierteljahrsschrift</i>, 1845, Bd. 3. it i., roughly identical with a passage in Chapter II, Volume I of <i>The German Ideology</i> (see this volume, pp. 112-14). In English the item was first published in Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, <i>The German Ideology</i>, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1964.</p>

<p class="fst">
<span class="term">7</span> <i>The German Ideology — Die deutsche Ideologie. Kritik der neuesten deutschen Philosophie in ihren Repräsentanten Feuerbach, B. Bauer und Stirner, und des deutschen Sozialismus in seinen verschiedenen Propheten</i> — is the joint work of Marx and Engels which they wrote in Brussels in 1845 and 1846.</p>
<p>Marx and Engels decided to write a philosophical work in which they intended to counterpose their materialist conception of history to the idealist views of the Young Hegelians and to Feuerbach’s inconsistent materialism in the spring of 1845, when Engels came to Brussels (early in April) and Marx outlined to him his materialist conception, which had nearly taken shape by then. Marx’s “Theses on Feuerbach” were written in connection with this project. In the autumn of 1845 the project took the form of a definite plan to write a two-volume work directed against the Young Hegelians and the “true socialists.” In November 1845 Marx and Engels began writing the book. In the course of their work the plan and composition of the book were changed several times. Moses Hess was enlisted to write two chapters. But the chapter against the Young Hegelian Arnold Ruge, which Hess wrote for Volume I, was excluded from the final version of <i>The German Ideology, </i>and the other chapter, dealing with the “true socialist” Kuhlmann, which Hess wrote for Volume II, was edited by Marx and Engels.</p>
<p>Work on <i>The German Ideology</i> was in the main terminated in April 1846; it seems, however, that the authors continued working on Chapter I of the first volume until the middle of July, but it was never completed. The draft of the preface for Volume I was written by Marx not later than the middle of August. Work on Volume II was completed by early June 1846. Engels’ work, <i>The True Socialists</i>, which was intended as the concluding chapter of Volume II, was written between January and April 1847.</p>
<p>In 1846 and 1847 Marx and Engels made repeated attempts to find a publisher in Germany for their work, but they were unsuccessful. This was due partly to difficulties made by the police and partly to the reluctance of the publishers to print the work, since their sympathies were on the side of the trends which Marx and Engels criticised. The only Chapter of <i>The German Ideology</i> known to be published during their lifetime was Chapter IV of Volume II, which appeared in the journal <i>Das Westphälische Dampfboot</i> in August and September 1847.</p>
<p>The text of a few pages in Chapter II of Volume I (pp. 112-14 of this volume) is similar to that of an anonymous item dated “Brussels, November 20” (see this volume, pp. 15-18), which appeared in the <i>Gesellschaftsspiegel, </i>Heft VII, January 1846 (in the section “Nachrichten und Notizen”).</p>
<p>Neither the title of the whole work nor the headings of the first and the second volumes have survived in the manuscript. They are, however, mentioned by Marx in his article “Declaration against Karl Grün” (see present edition, Vol. 6) and have been taken from there.</p>
<p>The manuscript of chapters II and III of Volume II is missing, and it is possible that the “Circular against Kriege” by Marx and Engels and Engels’ article “German Socialism in Verse and Prose” (see present edition, Vol. 6) formed part of this volume.</p>
<p>The manuscript is in a rather poor condition, the paper has turned yellow and is damaged in places. “The gnawing criticism of the mice”, as Marx wrote later in his preface to <i>A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</i>, has left its mark on a number of pages, other pages are missing. The Preface to <i>The German Ideology </i>and some of the alterations and additions are in Marx’s hand; the bulk of the manuscript, however, is in Engels’ hand, except for Chapter V of Volume II and some passages in Chapter III of Volume I. which are in Joseph Weydemeyer’s hand. As a rule, the pages are divided into two parts: the main text is on the left side while additions and changes are on the right. A number of passages were crossed out by the authors, and a few more passages were crossed out by Eduard Bernstein (this has been pointed out by S. Bahne in his article “<i>Die Deutsche Ideologie </i>von Marx und Engels. Einige Textergänzungen”, published in the <i>International Review of Social History</i>, Vol. VII, 1962, Part 1).</p>
<p>Words and passages which have become unreadable have been reconstructed on the basis of the unimpaired parts whenever possible; they are enclosed in square brackets. Wherever it was necessary to insert a few words to clarify the meaning, they are likewise printed in square brackets. Gaps in the manuscript are indicated in footnotes. Marginal notes as well as the most important of the crossed-out passages are given in footnotes which are indicated by asterisks, whereas the editors’ footnotes are indicated by index letters. Passages crossed out by Bernstein, wherever it was possible to decipher them, have been restored.</p>
<p>After Engels’ death the manuscript of <i>The German Ideology</i> came into the hands of the leaders of the German Social-Democratic Party, who in the course of 37 years published less than half of it. Part of Chapter III, “Saint Max”, was published by Bernstein in 1903-04 (see Karl Marx und Friedrich Engels, “III. Sankt Max”, in <i>Dokumente des Sozialismus</i>, Stuttgart, Bd. III, Hefte 1-4 and 7-8, Januar-April and Juli-August 1903; Bd. IV, Hefte 5-9, Mai-September 1904). Another part of this chapter — “My Self-Enjoyment” — was brought out in 191 3 (see Karl Marx, “Mein Selbstgenuss”, in <i>Arbeiter-Feuilleton</i>, München, Nr. 8 and 9, März 1913). Gustav Meyer published the introductory pages of “The Leipzig Council” and Chapter If, “Saint Bruno”, in 1921 (see Friedrich Engels und Karl Marx, “Das Leipziger Konzil”, in <i>Archiv für Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik</i>, 47. Band, 3. Heft, Tübingen, 1921). Chapter I, “Feuerbach”, the most important chapter of <i>The German Ideology</i>, was first published by the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U. in Russian in 1924 (Marx-Engels Archives, Book 1) and in German in 1926 (<i>Marx-Engels Archiv</i>, I. Band). The whole work as it has come down to us (except for the six pages which were found later and printed in the <i>International Review of Social History</i>, Vol. VII, 1962, Part 1) was first published in <i>Marx/Engels Gesamtausgabe</i>, Erste Abteilung, 5. Band, in 1932 by the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U.</p>
<p>The first English version of Chapter 1, translated from the Russian, was published in the American journal The Marxist No. 3, July 1926. A small part of this chapter, translated from the German, was published in the British journal The Labour Monthly, Vol. 15, No. 3, March 1933. An English translation of Chapter 1, “Feuerbach”, and Volume II, “Der wahre Sozialismus”, was published by Lawrence and Wishart Ltd., London, 1938, under the title <i>The German Ideology</i>, Parts I <i>&amp;</i> III. The first English translation of the whole work, except for one passage from Chapter I of the first volume (p. 29 of the manuscript), was issued by Progress Publishers, Moscow, in 1964.</p>
<a id="8"></a>
<p class="fst">
<span class="term">8</span> The manuscript of Chapter 1 of the first volume of <i>The German Ideology</i> has come down to us in the form of several separate passages written at different times and in different circumstances. This is due to changes which Marx and Engels made in the general plan of the book as the work proceeded.</p>
<p>Originally Marx and Engels began writing a purely critical work dealing simultaneously with Ludwig Feuerbach, Bruno Bauer and Max Stirner. Then they decided to discuss Bruno Bauer and Max Stirner in separate chapters (“II. Saint Bruno” and “III. Saint Max”), and the first chapter was conceived as a general introduction stating their own views in opposition to Feuerbach’s. Therefore they crossed out nearly all passages referring to Bauer and Stirner in the original manuscript and transferred them to chapters II or III. Thus, the chronologically first part, which formed the original nucleus of the chapter on Feuerbach (29 pages numbered by Marx), took shape.</p>
<p>Then they wrote Chapter II and began to work on Chapter III. In the course of their critical analysis of Stirner’s book <i>Der Einzige und sein Eigenthum</i>, Marx and Engels made various theoretical digressions in which they developed their materialist conception of history. Two of these digressions were subsequently transferred by them from the chapter on Stirner to that on Feuerbach. The first — consisting of 6 pages — was written in connection with the criticism of Stirner’s idealist view that history was dominated by spirit (this digression was originally in the section “D. Hierarchy”; see this volume, p. 175). The second theoretical digression — consisting of 37 pages — was written in connection with the criticism of Stirner’s views of bourgeois society, competition and the interrelation between private property, state and law (this latter passage from the chapter on Stirner was replaced by another; see this volume, p. 355, etc.). These two digressions formed the chronologically second and third parts of the chapter on Feuerbach.</p>
<p>The pages of these three parts were numbered by Marx (1 to 72) and thus form the rough copy of the whole chapter. Pages 3-7 and 36-39 of the manuscript have not been found.</p>
<p>Marx and Engels then started revising the rough copy and writing out a clean copy, the beginning of which exists in two versions. We have thus four more or less independent parts of the manuscript (three parts of rough copy and one of clean copy).</p>
<p>In the present edition the chapter on Feuerbach is accordingly divided into four parts. Part I consists of the combined fragments of the clean copy. Part II comprises the original nucleus of the whole chapter. Parts III and IV are the two theoretical digressions transferred from the chapter on Stirner. Each part is a consistent, logically coherent whole. The parts complement one another and together they are a comprehensive exposition of the materialist conception of history.</p>
<p>The content of the four parts can be summarised in the following way: 1. Introduction, general remarks concerning the idealism of German post-Hegelian philosophy. Premises, essence and general outline of the materialist conception of history. II. Materialist conception of historical development and conclusions from the materialist conception of history. Criticism of the idealist conception of history in general, criticism of the Young Hegelians and Feuerbach in particular. III. Origin of the idealist conception of history. IV. Development of the productive forces, of the division of labour and of the forms of property. The class structure of society. The political superstructure. Forms of social consciousness.</p>
<p>Comparison of the different parts of the manuscript makes it possible to bring out the logical structure of the chapter, form an idea of the authors’ intentions and reconstruct the general plan of the chapter. First Marx and Engels give a general description of German ideology, then they counterpose the materialist conception of history to the idealist conception, and, finally, criticise the latter. The central part of the chapter has the following structure: the authors’ premises; their materialist conception of history; the conclusions following from their theory.</p>
<p>The materialist conception of history is presented as follows: development of production — intercourse (social relations) — political superstructure — forms of social consciousness. On the whole, the plan of the chapter, reconstructed in accordance with the intentions of Marx and Engels, can be formulated thus: </p>
<p class="quoteb">1) General description of German ideology (Part I, introductory remarks and Section 1; Part II, Section 1). <br>
2) Premises <i>of the </i>materialist conception <i>of </i>history (Part I, Section 2). <br>
3) Production (Part II, Sections 3-5; Part I, Section 3; Part IV, Sections 1-5), intercourse (Part IV, Sections 6-10), political superstructure (Part IV, Section 11), forms <i>of social consciousness </i>(Part III, Section 1; Part IV, Section 12). <br>
4) <i>Conclusions from and summary of the materialist conception of history </i>(Part II, Sections 6-7; Part 1, Section 4). <br>
5) <i>Critique of the idealist conception of history in general, and of the Young Hegelians and Feuerbach in particular</i> (Part II, Sections 8-9 and 2; Part III, Section 1).</p>
<p>In the manuscript the chapter as a whole has the heading: “1. Feuerbach.” While sorting out Marx’s papers alter his death in 1883, Engels found among them the manuscript of <i>The German Ideology</i> and re-read it. At the end of the first chapter he made the note: “I. Feuerbach. Opposition of the materialist and idealist outlooks.”</p>
<p>The parts of this chapter are subdivided into sections. These subdivisions have been made by the editors, who also supplied most of the headings. All headings supplied by the editors and all editorial insertions are enclosed in square brackets.</p>
<p>The pages of the manuscript are indicated in this volume. The sheets of the clean copy, partly numbered by Engels (sheets 3 and 5), are indicated thus: [sh. 1|, |sh. 2], etc. The pages of the first version of the beginning of the clean copy, which were not numbered by the authors, are indicated thus: [p. 1|, p. 2|, etc, The pages of the three rough drafts, which were numbered by Marx, are indicated thus: |1|, 2|, etc.</p>
<p>The arrangement of the different parts of the manuscript within Chapter 1 and its subdivision into sections are the same as in the Russian version first published in the journal <i>Voprosy Filosofii</i> (<i>Questions of Philosophy</i>), Nos. 10 and 11, Moscow, 1965. In English this version was first published by Progress Publishers in Vol. I of <i>Karl Marx and Frederick Engels,</i> <i>Selected Works</i> (in three volumes), Moscow, 1969.</p>

In the course of this struggle (end of the 4th and the beginning of the 3rd century B.C.) Alexander’s Empire, an unstable military and administrative union, disintegrated into several independent states.</p>
<a id="11"></a>
<p class="fst">
<span class="term">11</span> In <i>The German Ideology </i>the term “ <i>Verkehr</i>” (“intercourse”) is used in a very broad sense. It comprises both the material and spiritual intercourse of individuals, social groups and whole countries. Marx and Engels show that material intercourse, and above all the intercourse of men in the process of production, is the basis of all other forms of intercourse. The terms <i>Verkehrsform</i> (form of intercourse), <i>Verkehrsweise </i>(mode of intercourse), <i>Verkehrsverhältnisse</i> (relations of intercourse) and <i>Produktions- und Verkehrsverhältnisse</i> (relations of production and intercourse) are used by Marx and Engels in <i>The German Ideology</i> to express the concept “relations of production”, which at that time was taking shape in their minds.</p>
<a id="12"></a>
<p class="fst">
<span class="term">12</span> The term “Stamm” used by Marx and Engels has been translated as “tribe” in this volume. It had a wider range of meaning at the time of the writing of <i>The German Ideology </i>than it has at present. It was used to denote a community of people descended from a common ancestor, and comprised the modern concepts of “gens” and “tribe”. The first to define and differentiate these concepts was the American ethnologist and historian Lewis Henry Morgan in his main work Ancient <i>Society; or, Researches in the Lines </i>of Human Progress from Savagery Through Barbarism to Civilisation (1877). Morgan showed for the first time the significance of the gens as the primary cell of the primitive communal system and thereby laid the scientific foundations for the history of primitive society as a whole. In his work The Origin <i>of the </i>Family, Private Property and <i>the State </i>(1884) Engels showed the far-reaching significance of Morgan’s discoveries and his concepts “gens” and “tribe” for the study of primitive society.</p>
<a id="13"></a>
<p class="fst">
<span class="term">13</span> The agrarian law proposed by Licinius and Sextius, Roman tribunes of the people, was passed in 367 B.C. as a result of the struggle waged by the plebeians against the patricians. It prohibited Roman citizens from holding more than 500 <i>yugera</i> (about 309 acres) of common land (<i>ager publicus</i>).</p>
<p>By <i>civil wars</i> in Rome is usually meant the struggle between various groups of the Roman ruling class which started at the end of the 2nd century B.C. and continued until 30 B.C. These wars, together with the growing class contradictions and slave revolts, accelerated the decline of the Roman Republic and led to the establishment, in 30 B.C., of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p class="fst">
<span class="term">17</span> The reference is to the following works published in the <i>Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher</i> early in 1844: two articles by Marx, “On the Jewish Question” and “Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Law. Introduction”, and two by Engels, “Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy” and “The Condition of England. <i>Past and Present</i> by Thomas Carlyle, London, 1843” (see present edition, Vol. 3). These works marked the final transition of Marx and Engels to materialism and communism.</p>

<p class="fst">
<span class="term">19</span> The conclusion that the proletarian revolution could only be carried through in all the advanced capitalist countries simultaneously, and hence that the victory of the revolution in a single country was impossible, was expressed even more definitely in the “Principles of Communism” written by Engels in 1847 (see present edition, Vol. 6). In their later works, however, Marx and Engels expressed this idea in a less definite way and emphasised that the proletarian revolution should be regarded as a comparatively long and complicated process which can develop first in individual capitalist countries. In the new historical conditions V. I. Lenin came to the conclusion, which he based on the specific circumstances of operation of the law of the uneven economic and political development of capitalism in the epoch of imperialism, that the socialist revolution could be victorious at first even in a single country. This thesis was set forth for the first time in his article “On the Slogan for a United States of Europe” (1915) (V. I. Lenin, <i>Collected Works</i>, Vol. 21).</p>
<a id="20"></a>
<p class="fst">
<span class="term">20</span> In the German original the term “<i>Haupt- und Staatsaktionen</i>” (“principal and spectacular actions”) is used, which has several meanings. In the 17th and the first half of the 18th century, it denoted plays performed by German touring companies. The plays, which were rather formless, presented tragic historical events in a bombastic and at the same time coarse and farcical way.</p>
<p>Secondly, this term can denote major political events. It was used in this sense by a trend in German historical science known as “<i>objective historiography</i>”. Leopold Ranke was one of its chief representatives. He regarded “<i>Haupt- und Staatsaktionen</i>” as the main subject-matter to be set forth. Objective historiography, which was primarily interested in the political and diplomatic history of nations, proclaimed the pre-eminence of foreign politics over domestic politics and disregarded the social relations of men and their active role in history.</p>

<span class="term">21</span> <i>The Continental System</i>, or the <i>Continental Blockade</i>, proclaimed by Napoleon I in 1806, after Prussia’s defeat, prohibited trade between the countries of the European Continent and Great Britain.

<span class="term">26</span> A reference to Feuerbach’s article “<i>Ueber das Wesen des Christenthums in Beziehung auf den Einzigen und sein Eigenthum</i>” published in Wigand’s <i>Vierteljahrsschrift</i>, 1845, Bd. 2. The article ends as follows: “Hence F[euerbach] is not a materialist, nor an idealist, nor a philosopher of identity. What is he then? He is the same in his thought as he is actually, the same in spirit as in the flesh, the same in his essence as in his sense-impression — he is a man or, rather, since F. simply places the essence of man in the community, he is a communal man, a communist.”</p>

<p class="fst">
<span class="term">29</span> <i>The Anti-Corn Law League</i> was founded in 1838 by the Manchester manufacturers Cobden and Bright. The English Corn Laws, first adopted in the 15th century, imposed high tariffs on imported cereals in order to maintain high prices for them in the home market. In the first third of the 19th century, in 1815, 1822 and later, several laws were passed changing the conditions for corn imports, and in 1828 a sliding scale was introduced which raised import tariffs on corn when prices in the home market declined and, on the other hand, lowered tariffs when prices rose in Britain.</p>
<p>The League widely exploited the popular discontent over the raising of corn prices. In its efforts to obtain the repeal of the Corn Laws and the establishment of complete freedom of trade, it aimed at weakening the economic and political positions of the landed aristocracy and lowering the cost of living thus making possible a lowering of the workers’ wages.</p>
<p>The struggle between the industrial bourgeoisie and the landed aristocracy over the Corn Laws ended with the repeal of these laws in 1846.</p>

<span class="term">31</span> During the following years, Marx and Engels changed their evaluation of the medieval peasant uprisings both as a result of their studies of the peasants’ struggle against feudalism and also of the revolutionary actions of the peasants in 1848 and 1849. Engels, in particular, in his work <i>The Peasant War in Germany</i> (written in 1850) showed the revolutionary nature of the peasant risings and the part they played in undermining the very basis of the feudal system.</p>

The best known was that of 1651, directed mainly against the Dutch, who controlled most of the carrying trade. It prohibited the importation of any goods not carried by English ships or the ships of the country where the goods were produced, and laid down that British coasting trade and commerce with the colonies were to be carried on only by English ships. The Navigation Laws were modified in the early 19th century and repealed in 1849 except for a reservation regarding coasting trade, which was revoked in 1854.</p>

The term has therefore been translated according to its concrete content and the given context either as “civil society” (in the first case) or as “bourgeois society” (in the second).</p>

<span class="term">45</span> The structure of this chapter parodies Stirner’s manner of presenting his material. In his book <i>Der Einzige und sein Eigenthum</i> Stirner often interrupts his exposition with “episodical insertions” which are not directly connected with the subject-matter. Poking fun at this manner, Marx and Engels begin the chapter with a reference to Stirner’s article “Recensenten Stirners” (published in Wigand’ <i>Vierteljahrsschrift</i>, Vol. 3), which they ironically call “Apologetical Commentary”. It is Stirner’s reply to the criticism of his book by Szeliga, Feuerbach and Hess. Then follows a lengthy “episodical insertion”, which takes up nearly the whole of this long chapter. It contains a critical analysis of Stirner’s book, and only at the end of the chapter, in Section 2, do Marx and Engels return to the above-mentioned article. The structure of the “episode” corresponds to that of the book they criticised, and, just like the latter, it comprises two parts ironically entitled “The Old Testament: Man”, and “The New Testament: ‘Ego"’. The corresponding parts in Stirner’s book are entitled “Der Mensch” (“Man”) and “Ich” (“Ego”).

When Paul Weller was preparing <i>The German Ideology</i> for publication as Band 5, Erste Abteilung of <i>Marx/Engels Gesamtausgabe</i> (MEGA), he suggested that the subsection “I. Society” may have consisted of five parts. The heading of the first is unknown, but it might have been “1. Die verstirnerte Gesellschaft” (“1. Stirnerised Society”), or “1. Die Gesellschaft im allgemeinen"’ (“1. Society in General”), or “1. Die menschliche Gesellschaft” (“1. Human Society”). That of the second was probably “2. Die Gesellschaft als Gefängnisgesellschaft” (“2. Society as Prison Society”); of the third, “3. Die Gesellschaft als Familie” (“3. Society as a Family”); of the fourth, “4. Die Gesellschaft als Staat” (“Society as State”), of which only the last portion has been found. The fifth part has been preserved in its entirety and is called “5. Die Gesellschaft als bürgerliche Gesellschaft” (“5. Society as Bourgeois Society”).</p>

<a id="128"></a>
<p class="fst">
<span class="term">128</span> This chapter was published by Marx separately as a review in the monthly publication <i>Das Westphälische Dampfboot </i>in August and September 1847. Before that, in April 1847, Marx had published a “Declaration against Karl Grün”. He stated in it that he intended to publish a review of Grün’s book Die <i>soziale</i> <i>Bewegung </i>in Frankreich und <i>Belgien </i>(see present edition, Vol. 6) in the <i>Westphälische </i>Dampfboot. But the first instalment of this article was published only in August 1847. The editors explained in a note that the article could not be published earlier because “for over two months the manuscript was sent from one German town to another without reaching us”.</p>
<p>The work was published in the <i>Westphälische Dampfboot </i>as Marx’s article (the name of the author was mentioned in the editorial note). Consequently one can assume that in contrast to Vol. 1, which was written jointly by Marx and Engels, some chapters of Vol. II of <i>The German Ideology </i>are probably the individual work of one or other of them. But since the manuscript of this chapter of Vol. If is in Engels’ handwriting, it is likely that Engels helped to write it. The copy sent to the <i>Westphälische Dampfboot</i> was probably made from this manuscript. The manuscript and the published text are practically identical. Comparatively few changes were made in the text itself and it is possible that some of these were by the editors of the journal. In this volume, variants affecting the meaning are given in footnotes. Where the manuscript is damaged the missing passages have been taken from the printed text. Such passages have not been specially marked (either by square brackets or footnotes) in this chapter.</p>

These organisations had a democratic programme, advocated land reform and other social measures and supported the demand for a ten-hour working day. Although they were short-lived (they existed only until 1834), had a local characters and were composed of factions holding rather heterogeneous views, these first workers’ parties gave an impetus to the incipient labour movement in the United States and helped to disseminate utopian socialist ideas, for many of their members were supporters of this trend.</p>

<p><i>Die Neue Welt oder das Reich des Geistes auf Erden</i>, the book examined in this chapter, was published anonymously in 1845. It consists of lectures by Georg Kuhlmann delivered in the Swiss communities of the League of the Just. These communities were founded by Wilhelm Weitling. The League of the Just was a secret organisation of German workers and artisans, which had branches in Germany, France, Switzerland and England. The ideas of “true socialism” were at that time widespread among the members of the League, many of whom were artisans living abroad.

<p>By the beginning of 1847 the development of “true socialism” had led to the formation of various groups (e.g., the Westphalian, Saxon and Berlin groups) within the general framework of this trend. Engels, therefore, decided to add a critical examination of the different “true socialist” groups to Volume II of <i>The German Ideology</i>. (See his letter to Marx of January 15, 1847.) The result was the manuscript called here <i>The</i> <i>True Socialists. </i>He continued to work on it at least until the middle of April, for an issue of the journal Die Grenzboten published on April 10, 1847, is mentioned in the text. The manuscript has no heading and, to judge by the ending, the work remained unfinished. It was for the first time published by the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U. in German in 1932. In English it was published for the first time in Karl Marx. and Frederick Engels, <i>The German Ideology</i>, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1964.</p>

The movement, which arose in 1844 and gained ground in a number of German states, was supported by considerable sections of the middle and petty bourgeoisie. The “German Catholics” did not recognise the supremacy of the Pope, rejected many dogmas and rites of the Roman Catholic Church, and sought to adapt Catholicism to the needs of the rising German bourgeoisie.</p>

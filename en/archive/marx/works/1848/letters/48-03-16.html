<h4>Paris, 16 March 1848</h4>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>I never have a minute these days to write at any length. I confine myself to essentials.</p>
<p><i>Flocon</i> is very well disposed towards you.</p>
<p>The Straubingers<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#86" target=_blank>[86]</a></sup> here are all more or less furious with you (set-to with Sch<span class="context">[erzer]</span>., etc.).</p>
<p>As regards my things, take them with you as far as Valenciennes and have them sealed there. Everything will go through exempt. As regards the <i>silver</i>, it has already been hallmarked here in Paris.</p>
<p>In Valenciennes you must in any case go to the man whose address I enclose. On Vogler’s advice my wife sent him the keys to the trunks (which are in Brussels), but without a way-bill. You must fetch these keys from him, otherwise everything will be broken open by the customs here.</p>
<p>As regards the money, tell <i>Cassel </i>he must give you the bill if he won’t pay it. Then perhaps Baillut will pay it.</p>
<p>Get Gigot to settle accounts and at least give you the balance.</p>
<p>As regards Breyer, you must go to see him again and point out what a <i>shabby trick</i> it would be if he made use of my ill-fortune to avoid payment. He must hand over at least part to you. The revolution hasn’t cost him a sou.</p>
<p>The bourgeoisie here are again becoming atrociously uppish and reactionary, but they'll see.</p>
<p>Bornstedt and Herwegh are behaving like scoundrels. They have founded a black, red and gold association <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#205" target=_blank>[205]</a></sup> in opposition to us. The former is to be expelled from the <span class="context">[Communist]</span> League today.</p>
<p>Your<br>
M.</p>
<p>At the moment I am unable to find the way-bill and this letter must go off.</p>
<p>Dismiss Gigot if he doesn’t begin to show signs of activity.</p>
<p>just now the fellow ought to be more energetic.</p>
<p>My warmest regards to Maynz; also to Jottrand. I have received the latest <i>Débat social.</i></p>
<p>My regards to Vogler likewise.</p>
<p>I shall write at length to Maynz and Jottrand.<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#206" target=_blank>[206]</a></sup></p>
<p>Farewell.</p>

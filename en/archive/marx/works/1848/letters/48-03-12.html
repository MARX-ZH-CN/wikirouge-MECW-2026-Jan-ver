<h4>Paris, between 7 and 12 March 1848 <br>
10, rue neuve Ménilmontant (Boulevard Beaumarchais)</h4>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Get Breyer to pay you the <i>100 francs</i> which he solemnly promised me to repay within a week, get <i>30</i> from Gigot, <i>10</i> from Hess. I hope that, as things are now, Breyer will keep his promise.</p>
<p>Maynz will cash the bill for 114 fr. at Cassel’s and give you the money. Collect these various sums and use them.</p>
<p>They spoke kindly of you at the <i>Réforme</i>. Flocon is ill and I haven’t yet seen him. The rumour spread by Seiler is circulating among the Germans generally. Allard has not yet been ousted by the revolution. I advise you to come here.</p>
<p>Central Authority has been constituted here,<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#197" target=_blank>[197]</a></sup> since Jones, Harney, Schapper, Bauer and Moll are all on the spot. I have been nominated chairman and Schapper secretary. Members are: Wallau, Lupus, Moll, Bauer and Engels.</p>
<p>Jones left for England yesterday; Harney is ill. Salut.</p>
<p>Your<br>
K. M.</p>

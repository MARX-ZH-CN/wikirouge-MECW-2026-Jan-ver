<i>Cologne, </i>July 23. We have recently mentioned the newspaper <i>L'Alba</i> which appears in Florence and which has held out its fraternal hand to us across the Alps. It was to be expected that another journal, <i>La Concordia</i> in Turin, a newspaper of opposite colours, should declare itself in an opposite, though by no means hostile, manner. In a former issue <i>La Concordia</i> expressed the opinion that the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> backs any group as long as it is “<i>oppressed</i>”.<i> </i>The paper was led to this not very sensible invention by our judgment of the events in Prague and our sympathy for the democratic forces ‘ against the reactionary Windischgrätz and Co. Perhaps the Turin journal has become more enlightened in the meantime about the so-called Czech movement.</p>
<p>Lately, however, <i>La Concordia</i> felt induced to devote a more or less doctrinaire article to the <i>Nuova Gazzetta Renana</i>. It has read in our newspaper the programme for the Workers’ Congress<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume07/footnote.html#178" target=_blank>[178]</a></sup> which is to be convened in Berlin and the eight points which are to be discussed by the workers are disturbing it to a significant degree.</p>
<p>After faithfully translating the whole, it begins a sort of criticism with the following words:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“There is much that is true and just in these proposals, but the <i>Concordia</i> would betray its mission if it did not raise its voice against the errors of the socialists.”</p>
<p>We on our part protest against the “error” of the <i>Concordia</i> which consists in mistaking the programme issued by the respective commission for the Workers’ Congress, and which we merely reported, for <i>our own</i>. We are nevertheless ready to enter upon a discussion on political economy with the <i>Concordia</i> as soon as its programme offers something more than a few well-known philanthropic phrases and picked-up free trade dogmas.</p>

<p><i>Cologne, </i>July 3. Up to now the Government of <i>Action</i> has only proved itself as the Ministry of the Police. Its first act was the arrest of Herr <i>Monecke </i>and Herr <i>Fernbach</i> in Berlin. Its second act was the arrest of Bombardier <i>Funk</i> in Saarlouis. Now “action” is beginning to make itself felt here in Cologne too. This morning Dr. <i>Gottschalk</i> and Lieutenant (ret.) <i>Anneke</i> were arrested. We are reserving our judgment since we are still lacking definite information about the reasons for their arrest and the manner in which it was carried out.</p>
<p>The workers will be sensible enough not to let themselves he provoked into creating a disturbance.</p>

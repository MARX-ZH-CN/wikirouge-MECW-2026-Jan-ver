<p><i>Cologne, </i>November 28. In its issue of November 17 the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> stated:</p>
<p>“And as for the <i>Jews, </i>who since the emancipation of their sect have everywhere put themselves, at least in the person of their eminent representatives, at the <i>head of the counter-revolution</i> — what awaits them? There has been no waiting for victory in order to throw them back into their ghetto.” </p>
<p>At the time, we quoted government decrees from <i>Bromberg</i>. Today we have a still more striking fact to report. The big “Three Crowns” masonic lodge in Berlin — it is well known that the <i>Prince of Prussia</i> is the supreme head of the Prussian freemasons, just as <i>Frederick William IV</i> is the supreme head of the Prussian religion — has put a stop to the activity of the <i>Minerva</i> lodge in Cologne. Why? <i>Because</i> <i>it has Jews among </i>its <i>members. Let the Jews take note of this!</i> </p>
<p>A circular of the Brandenburg Ministry to all administrative bodies, which we came upon by chance, calls upon them to carry out <i>mass arrests of the leaders of the clubs.</i> </p>
<p>We are assured from a trustworthy source that <i>Cologne, Düsseldorf,</i> <i>Aachen etc. </i>will be given imperial troops, in fact <i>Austrians</i>, as a Christmas present from our most gracious sovereign. Probably they will include <i>Croats, Serezhans, Czechs, Raizes, Serbs etc.,</i><sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume08/footnote.html#112" target=_blank>[112]</a></sup> so that “order and calm” will be established in the Rhine Province as in Vienna. By the way, people say that the Rhine Province borders not on <i>Russia</i> but on <i>France</i>. <i>Let the most gracious sovereign take note of this!</i></p>

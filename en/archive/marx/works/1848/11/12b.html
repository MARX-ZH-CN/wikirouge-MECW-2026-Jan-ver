<p class="fst"><i>Berne</i>, November 12. In the sittings held so far, the two Swiss Chambers have not yet debated any of the more important questions. Last week the main business was the constituting of the two Councils; the debate on the publication of proceedings (which, as is known, has been dropped for the present without any conclusion being reached); the recall of deputies elected with reservations regarding the new Constitution.<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume08/footnote.html#35" target=_blank>[35]</a></sup> During yesterday’s sitting the oath for the federal authorities was finalised and the salaries of the Federal Council fixed (6,000 Swiss francs for the President, 5,000 for each of the councillors, and 4,000 and free residence for the Chancellor). It will now no longer be possible to delay the choice of the federal capital and the appointment of the Federal Council. In addition the <i>Vorort</i> yesterday informed both Councils of the measures taken with regard to Tessin.<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume08/footnote.html#36" target=_blank>[36]</a></sup> Tessiners have appealed against the <i>Vorort</i> to the new federal authorities; however, it is not to be expected that the latter will modify or revoke altogether the decisions taken by their predecessors.</p>

1. Reactionary Socialism
</h2>
<h6>
A. Feudal Socialism
</h6>
<p>
Owing to their historical position, it became the vocation of the 
aristocracies of France and England
to write pamphlets against modern bourgeois society. In the French Revolution
of July 1830, and in the English reform agitation<sup class="enote"><a href="#e1" id="eb1">[A]</a></sup>, these aristocracies
again succumbed to the hateful upstart. Thenceforth, a serious political
struggle was altogether out of the question. A literary battle alone remained
possible. But even in the domain of literature the old cries of the restoration
period had become impossible.<sup class="enote"><a href="#a1" id="ab1">(1)</a></sup>
<a id="137"> </a></p>
<p>In order to arouse sympathy, the aristocracy was obliged to lose
sight, apparently, of its own interests, and to formulate their indictment
against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the exploited working class
alone. Thus, the aristocracy took their revenge by singing lampoons on
their new masters and whispering in his ears sinister prophesies of coming
catastrophe.
<a id="138"> </a></p>
<p>In this way arose feudal Socialism: half lamentation, half lampoon;
half an echo of the past, half menace of the future; at times, by its bitter,
witty and incisive criticism, striking the bourgeoisie to the very heart’s
core; but always ludicrous in its effect, through total incapacity to comprehend
the march of modern history.
<a id="139"> </a></p>
<p>The aristocracy, in order to rally the people to them, waved the proletarian
alms-bag in front for a banner. But the people, so often as it joined them,
saw on their hindquarters the old feudal coats of arms, and deserted with
loud and irreverent laughter.
<a id="140"> </a></p>
<p>One section of the French <a href="../../../../../glossary/orgs/l/e.html#legitimists" target=_blank>Legitimists</a> and “<a href="../../../../../glossary/orgs/y/o.html#young-england" target=_blank>Young England</a>” exhibited
this spectacle.
<a id="141"> </a></p>
<p>In pointing out that their mode of exploitation was different
to that of the bourgeoisie, the feudalists forget that they exploited under
circumstances and conditions that were quite different and that are now
antiquated. In showing that, under their rule, the modern proletariat never
existed, they forget that the modern bourgeoisie is the necessary offspring
of their own form of society.
<a id="142"> </a></p>
<p>For the rest, so little do they conceal the reactionary character of
their criticism that their chief accusation against the bourgeois amounts
to this, that under the bourgeois <i>ré</i>gime a class is being developed which
is destined to cut up root and branch the old order of society.
<a id="143"> </a></p>
<p>What they upbraid the bourgeoisie with is not so much that it creates
a proletariat as that it creates a <i>revolutionary</i> proletariat.
<a id="144"> </a></p>
<p>In political practice, therefore, they join in
all coercive measures against the working class; and in ordinary life,
despite their high-falutin phrases, they stoop to pick up the golden apples
dropped from the tree of industry, and to barter truth, love, and honour,
for traffic in wool, beetroot-sugar, and potato spirits.<sup class="enote"><a href="#a2" id="ab2">(2)</a></sup>
<a id="145"> </a></p>
<p>As the parson has ever gone hand in hand with the landlord, so
has Clerical Socialism with Feudal Socialism.
<a id="146"> </a></p>
<p>Nothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a Socialist tinge.
Has not Christianity declaimed against private property, against marriage,
against the State? Has it not preached in the place of these, charity and
poverty, celibacy and mortification of the flesh, monastic life and Mother
Church? Christian Socialism is but the holy water with which the priest
consecrates the heart-burnings of the aristocrat.
</p>
<br>
<h6><a id="147"> </a>
B. Petty-Bourgeois Socialism
</h6>
<p>
The feudal aristocracy was not the only class that
was ruined by the bourgeoisie, not the only class whose conditions of existence
pined and perished in the atmosphere of modern bourgeois society. The medieval
burgesses and the small peasant proprietors were the precursors of the
modern bourgeoisie. In those countries which are but little developed,
industrially and commercially, these two classes still vegetate side by
side with the rising bourgeoisie.
<a id="148"> </a></p>
<p>In countries where modern civilisation has become fully developed, a
new class of <a href="../../../../../glossary/terms/p/e.html#petty-bourgeois" target=_blank>petty bourgeois</a> has been formed, fluctuating between proletariat
and bourgeoisie, and ever renewing itself as a supplementary part of bourgeois
society. The individual members of this class, however, are being constantly
hurled down into the proletariat by the action of competition, and, as
modern industry develops, they even see the moment approaching when they
will completely disappear as an independent section of modern society,
to be replaced in manufactures, agriculture and commerce, by overlookers,
bailiffs and shopmen.
<a id="149"> </a></p>
<p>In countries like France, where the peasants constitute far more than
half of the population, it was natural that writers who sided with the
proletariat against the bourgeoisie should use, in their criticism of the
bourgeois <i>régime</i>, the standard of the peasant and petty bourgeois, and
from the standpoint of these intermediate classes, should take up the cudgels
for the working class. Thus arose petty-bourgeois Socialism. Sismondi was
the head of this school, not only in France but also in England.
<a id="150"> </a></p>
<p>This school of Socialism dissected with great acuteness the contradictions
in the conditions of modern production. It laid bare the hypocritical apologies
of economists. It proved, incontrovertibly, the disastrous effects of machinery
and division of labour; the concentration of capital and land in a few hands;
overproduction and crises; it pointed out the inevitable ruin of the petty
bourgeois and peasant, the misery of the proletariat, the anarchy in production,
the crying inequalities in the distribution of wealth, the industrial war
of extermination between nations, the dissolution of old moral bonds, of
the old family relations, of the old nationalities.
<a id="151"> </a></p>
<p>In its positive aims, however, this form of Socialism aspires either
to restoring the old means of production and of exchange, and with them
the old property relations, and the old society, or to cramping the modern
means of production and of exchange within the framework of the old property
relations that have been, and were bound to be, exploded by those means.
In either case, it is both reactionary and Utopian.
<a id="152"> </a></p>
<p>Its last words are: corporate guilds for manufacture; patriarchal relations
in agriculture.
<a id="153"> </a></p>
<p>Ultimately, when stubborn historical facts had dispersed all intoxicating
effects of self-deception, this form of Socialism ended in a miserable
fit of the blues.
</p>
<br>
<h6><a id="154"> </a>
C. German or “True” Socialism
</h6>
<p>The Socialist and Communist literature of France,
a literature that originated under the pressure of a bourgeoisie in power,
and that was the expressions of the struggle against this power, was introduced
into Germany at a time when the bourgeoisie, in that country, had just begun
its contest with feudal absolutism.
<a id="155"> </a></p>
<p>German philosophers, would-be philosophers, and <i>beaux esprits</i>
<span class="context">(men of letters)</span>,
eagerly seized on this literature, only forgetting, that when
these writings immigrated from France into Germany, French social conditions
had not immigrated along with them. In contact with German social conditions,
this French literature lost all its immediate practical significance and
assumed a purely literary aspect. Thus, to the German philosophers of the
Eighteenth Century, the demands of the first French Revolution were nothing
more than the demands of “Practical Reason” in general, and the utterance
of the will of the revolutionary French bourgeoisie signified, in their
eyes, the laws of pure Will, of Will as it was bound to be, of true human
Will generally.
<a id="156"> </a></p>
<p>The work of the German <i>literati</i> consisted solely in bringing the new
French ideas into harmony with their ancient philosophical conscience,
or rather, in annexing the French ideas without deserting their own philosophic
point of view.
<a id="157"> </a></p>
<p>This annexation took place in the same way in which a foreign language
is appropriated, namely, by translation.
<a id="158"> </a></p>
<p>It is well known how the monks wrote silly lives of Catholic Saints
<i>over</i> the manuscripts on which the classical works of ancient heathendom
had been written. The German <i>literati</i> reversed this process with the profane
French literature. They wrote their philosophical nonsense beneath the
French original. For instance, beneath the French criticism of the economic
functions of money, they wrote “Alienation of Humanity”, and beneath the
French criticism of the bourgeois state they wrote “Dethronement of the
Category of the General”, and so forth.
<a id="159"> </a></p>
<p>The introduction of these philosophical phrases at the back of the French
historical criticisms, they dubbed “Philosophy of Action”, “True Socialism”,
“German Science of Socialism”, “Philosophical Foundation of Socialism”,
and so on.
<a id="160"> </a></p>
<p>The French Socialist and Communist literature was thus completely emasculated.
And, since it ceased in the hands of the German to express the struggle
of one class with the other, he felt conscious of having overcome “French
one-sidedness” and of representing, not true requirements, but the requirements
of Truth; not the interests of the proletariat, but the interests of Human
Nature, of Man in general, who belongs to no class, has no reality, who
exists only in the misty realm of philosophical fantasy.
<a id="161"> </a></p>
<p>This German socialism, which took its schoolboy task so seriously and
solemnly, and extolled its poor stock-in-trade in such a mountebank fashion,
meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic innocence.
<a id="162"> </a></p>
<p>The fight of the Germans, and especially of the Prussian bourgeoisie,
against feudal aristocracy and absolute monarchy, in other words, the liberal
movement, became more earnest.
<a id="163"> </a></p>
<p>By this, the long-wished for opportunity was offered to “True” Socialism
of confronting the political movement with the Socialist demands, of
hurling the traditional anathemas against liberalism, against representative
government, against bourgeois competition, bourgeois freedom of the press,
bourgeois legislation, bourgeois liberty and equality, and of preaching
to the masses that they had nothing to gain, and everything to lose, by
this bourgeois movement. German Socialism forgot, in the nick of time,
that the French criticism, whose silly echo it was, presupposed the existence
of modern bourgeois society, with its corresponding economic conditions
of existence, and the political constitution adapted thereto, the very
things those attainment was the object of the pending struggle in Germany.
<a id="164"> </a></p>
<p>To the absolute governments, with their following of parsons, professors,
country squires, and officials, it served as a welcome scarecrow against
the threatening bourgeoisie.
<a id="165"> </a></p>
<p>It was a sweet finish, after the bitter pills of flogging and bullets,
with which these same governments, just at that time, dosed the German
working-class risings.
<a id="166"> </a></p>
<p>While this “True” Socialism thus served the government as a weapon for
fighting the German bourgeoisie, it, at the same time, directly represented
a reactionary interest, the interest of German Philistines. In Germany,
the <i>petty-bourgeois</i> class, a relic of the sixteenth century, and since
then constantly cropping up again under the various forms, is the real
social basis of the existing state of things.
<a id="167"> </a></p>
<p>To preserve this class is to preserve the existing state of things in
Germany. The industrial and political supremacy of the bourgeoisie threatens
it with certain destruction — on the one hand, from the concentration
of capital; on the other, from the rise of a revolutionary proletariat.
“True” Socialism appeared to kill these two birds with one stone. It spread
like an epidemic.
<a id="168"> </a></p>
<p>The robe of speculative cobwebs, embroidered with flowers of rhetoric,
steeped in the dew of sickly sentiment, this transcendental robe in which
the German Socialists wrapped their sorry “eternal truths”, all skin and
bone, served to wonderfully increase the sale of their goods amongst such
a public.</p>
<p>And on its part German Socialism recognised, more and more, its
own calling as the bombastic representative of the petty-bourgeois Philistine.
<a id="169"> </a></p>
<p>It proclaimed the German nation to be the model
nation, and the German petty Philistine to be the typical man. To every
villainous meanness of this model man, it gave a hidden, higher, Socialistic
interpretation, the exact contrary of its real character. It went to the
extreme length of directly opposing the “brutally destructive” tendency
of Communism, and of proclaiming its supreme and impartial contempt of
all class struggles. With very few exceptions, all the so-called Socialist
and Communist publications that now (1847) circulate in Germany belong
to the domain of this foul and enervating literature.<sup class="enote"><a href="#a3" id="ab3">(3)</a></sup>
</p>
<p class="skip"><a id="b"> </a> </p>
<hr class="section"/>
<h2><a id="170"> </a>
2. Conservative or Bourgeois Socialism
</h2>
<p>A part of the bourgeoisie is desirous of redressing
social grievances in order to secure the continued existence of bourgeois
society.
<a id="171"> </a></p>
<p>To this section belong economists, philanthropists, humanitarians, improvers
of the condition of the working class, organisers of charity, members of
societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals, temperance fanatics,
hole-and-corner reformers of every imaginable kind. This form of socialism
has, moreover, been worked out into complete systems.
<a id="172"> </a></p>
<p>We may cite Proudhon’s <i>Philosophie de la Misère</i> as an example of
this form.
<a id="173"> </a></p>
<p>The Socialistic bourgeois want all the advantages of modern social conditions
without the struggles and dangers necessarily resulting therefrom. They
desire the existing state of society, minus its revolutionary and disintegrating
elements. They wish for a bourgeoisie without a proletariat. The bourgeoisie
naturally conceives the world in which it is supreme to be the best; and
bourgeois Socialism develops this comfortable conception into various more
or less complete systems. In requiring the proletariat to carry out such
a system, and thereby to march straightway into the social New Jerusalem,
it but requires in reality, that the proletariat should remain within the
bounds of existing society, but should cast away all its hateful ideas
concerning the bourgeoisie.
<a id="174"> </a></p>
<p>A second, and more practical, but less systematic, form of this Socialism
sought to depreciate every revolutionary movement in the eyes of the working
class by showing that no mere political reform, but only a change in the
material conditions of existence, in economical relations, could be of
any advantage to them. By changes in the material conditions of existence,
this form of Socialism, however, by no means understands abolition of the
bourgeois relations of production, an abolition that can be affected only
by a revolution, but administrative reforms, based on the continued existence
of these relations; reforms, therefore, that in no respect affect the relations
between capital and labour, but, at the best, lessen the cost, and simplify
the administrative work, of bourgeois government.
<a id="175"> </a></p>
<p>Bourgeois Socialism attains adequate expression when, and only when,
it becomes a mere figure of speech.
<a id="176"> </a></p>
<p>Free trade: for the benefit of the working class. Protective duties:
for the benefit of the working class. Prison Reform: for the benefit of
the working class. This is the last word and the only seriously meant word
of bourgeois socialism.
<a id="177"> </a></p>
<p>It is summed up in the phrase: the bourgeois is a bourgeois — for the
benefit of the working class.
</p>

<h2>
3. Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism
</h2>
<p>
We do not here refer to
that literature which, in every great modern revolution, has always given
voice to the demands of the proletariat, such as the writings of <a href="../../../../../glossary/people/b/a.html#francois-babeuf" target=_blank>Babeuf</a> and others.
<a id="179"> </a></p>
<p>The first direct attempts of the proletariat to attain its own ends,
made in times of universal excitement, when feudal society was being overthrown,
necessarily failed, owing to the then undeveloped state of the proletariat,
as well as to the absence of the economic conditions for its emancipation,
conditions that had yet to be produced, and could be produced by the impending
bourgeois epoch alone. The revolutionary literature that accompanied these
first movements of the proletariat had necessarily a reactionary character.
It inculcated universal asceticism and social levelling in its crudest
form.
<a id="180"> </a></p>
<p>The Socialist and Communist systems, properly
so called, those of <a href="../../../../../glossary/people/s/a.html#st-simon" target=_blank>Saint-Simon</a>,
<a href="../../../../../glossary/people/f/o.html#fourier" target=_blank>Fourier</a>, <a href="../../../../../glossary/people/o/w.html#owen" target=_blank>Owen</a>,
and others, spring into existence in the early undeveloped period, described
above, of the struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie (see <a href="ch01.html" target=_blank>Section
1. Bourgeois and Proletarians</a>).
<a id="181"> </a></p>
<p>The founders of these systems see, indeed, the class antagonisms, as
well as the action of the decomposing elements in the prevailing form of
society. But the proletariat, as yet in its infancy, offers to them the
spectacle of a class without any historical initiative or any independent
political movement.
<a id="182"> </a></p>
<p>Since the development of class antagonism keeps even pace with the development
of industry, the economic situation, as they find it, does not as yet offer
to them the material conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat.
They therefore search after a new social science, after new social laws,
that are to create these conditions.
<a id="183"> </a></p>
<p>Historical action is to yield to their personal inventive action; historically
created conditions of emancipation to fantastic ones; and the gradual,
spontaneous class organisation of the proletariat to an organisation of
society especially contrived by these inventors. Future history resolves
itself, in their eyes, into the propaganda and the practical carrying out
of their social plans.
<a id="184"> </a></p>
<p>In the formation of their plans, they are conscious of caring chiefly
for the interests of the working class, as being the most suffering class.
Only from the point of view of being the most suffering class does the
proletariat exist for them.
<a id="185"> </a></p>
<p>The undeveloped state of the class struggle, as well as their own surroundings,
causes Socialists of this kind to consider themselves far superior to all
class antagonisms. They want to improve the condition of every member of
society, even that of the most favoured. Hence, they habitually appeal to
society at large, without the distinction of class; nay, by preference,
to the ruling class. For how can people, when once they understand their
system, fail to see in it the best possible plan of the best possible state
of society?
<a id="186"> </a></p>
<p>Hence, they reject all political, and especially all revolutionary
action; they wish to attain their ends by peaceful means, necessarily doomed
to failure, and by the force of example, to pave the way for the new social
Gospel.
<a id="187"> </a></p>
<p>Such fantastic pictures of future society, painted at a time when the
proletariat is still in a very undeveloped state and has but a fantastic
conception of its own position, correspond with the first instinctive yearnings
of that class for a general reconstruction of society.
<a id="188"> </a></p>
<p>But these Socialist and Communist publications contain also a critical
element. They attack every principle of existing society. Hence, they are
full of the most valuable materials for the enlightenment of the working
class. The practical measures proposed in them — such as the abolition
of the distinction between town and country, of the family, of the carrying
on of industries for the account of private individuals, and of the wage
system, the proclamation of social harmony, the conversion of the function
of the state into a more superintendence of production — all these proposals
point solely to the disappearance of class antagonisms which were, at that
time, only just cropping up, and which, in these publications, are recognised
in their earliest indistinct and undefined forms only. These proposals,
therefore, are of a purely Utopian character.
<a id="189"> </a></p>
<p>The significance of Critical-Utopian Socialism
and Communism bears an inverse relation to historical development. In proportion
as the modern class struggle develops and takes definite shape, this fantastic
standing apart from the contest, these fantastic attacks on it, lose all
practical value and all theoretical justification. Therefore, although
the originators of these systems were, in many respects, revolutionary,
their disciples have, in every case, formed mere reactionary sects. They
hold fast by the original views of their masters, in opposition to the
progressive historical development of the proletariat. They, therefore,
endeavour, and that consistently, to deaden the class struggle and to reconcile
the class antagonisms. They still dream of experimental realisation of
their social Utopias, of founding isolated “phalansteres”, of establishing
“Home Colonies”, or setting up a “Little Icaria”<sup class="enote"><a href="#a4" id="ab4">(4)</a></sup>
— duodecimo editions of the New Jerusalem — and to realise all these castles
in the air, they are compelled to appeal to the feelings and purses of
the bourgeois. By degrees, they sink into the category of the reactionary [or] 
conservative Socialists depicted above, differing from these only by more
systematic pedantry, and by their fanatical and superstitious belief in
the miraculous effects of their social science.
<a id="190"> </a></p>
<p>They, therefore, violently oppose all political action on the part of
the working class; such action, according to them, can only result from
blind unbelief in the new Gospel.
<a id="191"> </a></p>
<p>The Owenites in England, and the Fourierists in France, respectively,
oppose the Chartists and the <i>Réformistes</i>.

This applies chiefly to Germany, where the landed aristocracy and squirearchy have large portions of their estates cultivated for their own account by stewards, and are, moreover, extensive beetroot-sugar manufacturers and distillers of potato spirits. The wealthier British aristocracy are, as yet, rather above that; but they, too, know how to make up for declining rents by lending their names to floaters or more or less shady joint-stock companies. <span class="inote">[Note by Engels to the English edition of 1888.]</span>

A reference to the movement for a reform of the electoral law which, under the pressure of the working class, was passed by the British House of Commons in 1831 and finally endorsed by the House of Lords in June, 1832. The reform was directed against monopoly rule of the landed and finance aristocracy and opened the way to Parliament for the representatives of the industrial bourgeoisie. Neither workers nor the petty-bourgeois were allowed electoral rights, despite assurances they would.

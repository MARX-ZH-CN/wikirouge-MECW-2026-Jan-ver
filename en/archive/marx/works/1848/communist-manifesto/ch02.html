<h3>Chapter II. Proletarians and Communists</h3>
<hr/>
<p><a id="061"> </a>
In what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a whole?</p>
<p>The Communists do not form a separate party opposed to the other working-class parties.
<a id="062"> </a></p>
<p>They have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole.
<a id="063"> </a></p>
<p>They do not set up any sectarian principles of their own, by which to
shape and mould the proletarian movement.
<a id="064"> </a></p>
<p>The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties
by this only:
<a id="065"> </a>
1. In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different
countries, they point out and bring to the front the common interests of
the entire proletariat, independently of all nationality.
<a id="066"> </a>
2. In the various stages of development which the struggle of
the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always
and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole.
<a id="067"> </a></p>
<p>
The Communists, therefore, are on the one hand, practically, the most advanced
and resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, that
section which pushes forward all others; on the other hand, theoretically,
they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly
understanding the line of march, the conditions, and the ultimate general
results of the proletarian movement.
<a id="068"> </a></p>
<p>The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other
proletarian parties: formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow
of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat.
<a id="069"> </a></p>
<p>The theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way based on
ideas or principles that have been invented, or discovered, by this or
that would-be universal reformer.
<a id="070"> </a></p>
<p>They merely express, in general terms, actual relations springing from
an existing class struggle, from a historical movement going on under our
very eyes. The abolition of existing property relations is not at all a
distinctive feature of communism.
<a id="071"> </a></p>
<p>All property relations in the past have continually been subject to
historical change consequent upon the change in historical conditions.
<a id="072"> </a></p>
<p>The French Revolution, for example, abolished feudal property in favour
of bourgeois property.
<a id="073"> </a></p>
<p>The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property
generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property. But modern bourgeois
private property is the final and most complete expression of the system
of producing and appropriating products, that is based on class antagonisms,
on the exploitation of the many by the few.
<a id="074"> </a></p>
<p>In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the
single sentence: Abolition of private property.
<a id="075"> </a></p>
<p>We Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the
right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a man’s own labour,
which property is alleged to be the groundwork of all personal freedom,
activity and independence.
<a id="076"> </a></p>
<p>Hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property! Do you mean the property
of petty artisan and of the small peasant, a form of property that preceded
the bourgeois form? There is no need to abolish that; the development of
industry has to a great extent already destroyed it, and is still destroying
it daily.
<a id="077"> </a></p>
<p>Or do you mean the modern bourgeois private property?
<a id="078"> </a></p>
<p>But does wage-labour create any property for the labourer? Not a
bit. It creates capital, <i>i.e.</i>, that kind of property which exploits 
wage-labour, and which cannot increase except upon condition of begetting a
new supply of wage-labour for fresh exploitation. Property, in its present
form, is based on the antagonism of capital and wage labour. Let us examine
both sides of this antagonism.
<a id="079"> </a></p>
<p>To be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal, but a social
<i>status</i> in production. Capital is a collective product, and only by the
united action of many members, nay, in the last resort, only by the united
action of all members of society, can it be set in motion.
<a id="080"> </a></p>
<p>Capital is therefore not only personal; it is a social power.
<a id="081"> </a></p>
<p>When, therefore, capital is converted into common property, into
the property of all members of society, personal property is not thereby
transformed into social property. It is only the social character of the
property that is changed. It loses its class character.
<a id="082"> </a></p>
<p>Let us now take wage-labour.
<a id="083"> </a></p>
<p>The average price of wage-labour is the minimum wage, <i>i.e.</i>, that quantum
of the means of subsistence which is absolutely requisite to keep the labourer
in bare existence as a labourer. What, therefore, the wage-labourer appropriates
by means of his labour, merely suffices to prolong and reproduce a bare existence.
We by no means intend to abolish this personal appropriation of the products
of labour, an appropriation that is made for the maintenance and reproduction
of human life, and that leaves no surplus wherewith to command the labour
of others. All that we want to do away with is the miserable character
of this appropriation, under which the labourer lives merely to increase
capital, and is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of the ruling
class requires it.
<a id="084"> </a></p>
<p>In bourgeois society, living labour is but a means to increase accumulated
labour. In Communist society, accumulated labour is but a means to widen,
to enrich, to promote the existence of the labourer.
<a id="085"> </a></p>
<p>In bourgeois society, therefore, the past dominates the present; in
Communist society, the present dominates the past. In bourgeois society
capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is
dependent and has no individuality.
<a id="086"> </a></p>
<p>And the abolition of this state of things is called by the bourgeois,
abolition of individuality and freedom! And rightly so. The abolition of
bourgeois individuality, bourgeois independence, and bourgeois freedom
is undoubtedly aimed at.
<a id="087"> </a></p>
<p>By freedom is meant, under the present bourgeois conditions of production,
free trade, free selling and buying.
<a id="088"> </a></p>
<p>But if selling and buying disappears, free selling and buying disappears
also. This talk about free selling and buying, and all the other “brave
words” of our bourgeois about freedom in general, have a meaning, if any,
only in contrast with restricted selling and buying, with the fettered
traders of the Middle Ages, but have no meaning when opposed to the Communistic
abolition of buying and selling, of the bourgeois conditions of production,
and of the bourgeoisie itself.
<a id="089"> </a></p>
<p>You are horrified at our intending to do away with private property.
But in your existing society, private property is already done away with
for nine-tenths of the population; its existence for the few is solely
due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths. You reproach
us, therefore, with intending to do away with a form of property, the necessary
condition for whose existence is the non-existence of any property for
the immense majority of society.
<a id="090"> </a></p>
<p>In one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your property.
Precisely so; that is just what we intend.
<a id="091"> </a></p>
<p>From the moment when labour can no longer be converted into capital,
money, or rent, into a social power capable of being monopolised, <i>i.e.</i>,
from the moment when individual property can no longer be transformed into
bourgeois property, into capital, from that moment, you say, individuality
vanishes.
<a id="092"> </a></p>
<p>You must, therefore, confess that by “individual” you mean no other
person than the bourgeois, than the middle-class owner of property. This
person must, indeed, be swept out of the way, and made impossible.
<a id="093"> </a></p>
<p>Communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the products of
society; all that it does is to deprive him of the power to subjugate the
labour of others by means of such appropriations.
<a id="094"> </a></p>
<p>It has been objected that upon the abolition of private property, all
work will cease, and universal laziness will overtake us.
<a id="095"> </a></p>
<p>According to this, bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone to
the dogs through sheer idleness; for those of its members who work, acquire nothing, 
and those who acquire anything do not work. 
The whole of this objection is but another expression of the tautology:
that there can no longer be any wage-labour when there is no longer any capital.
<a id="096"> </a></p>
<p>All objections urged against the Communistic mode of producing and appropriating
material products, have, in the same way, been urged against the Communistic
mode of producing and appropriating intellectual products. Just as, to the
bourgeois, the disappearance of class property is the disappearance of
production itself, so the disappearance of class culture is to him identical
with the disappearance of all culture.
<a id="097"> </a></p>
<p>That culture, the loss of which he laments, is, for the enormous majority,
a mere training to act as a machine.
<a id="098"> </a></p>
<p>But don’t wrangle with us so long as you apply, to our intended abolition
of bourgeois property, the standard of your bourgeois notions of freedom,
culture, law, &amp;c. Your very ideas are but the outgrowth of the conditions
of your bourgeois production and bourgeois property, just as your jurisprudence
is but the will of your class made into a law for all, a will whose essential
character and direction are determined by the economical conditions of
existence of your class.
<a id="099"> </a></p>
<p>The selfish misconception that induces you to transform into eternal
laws of nature and of reason, the social forms springing from your present
mode of production and form of property – historical relations that rise
and disappear in the progress of production – this misconception you share
with every ruling class that has preceded you. What you see clearly in
the case of ancient property, what you admit in the case of feudal property,
you are of course forbidden to admit in the case of your own bourgeois
form of property.
<a id="100"> </a></p>
<p>Abolition [<i>Aufhebung</i>] of the family! Even the most radical flare up at this infamous
proposal of the Communists.
<a id="101"> </a></p>
<p>On what foundation is the present family, the bourgeois family, based?
On capital, on private gain. In its completely developed form, this family
exists only among the bourgeoisie. But this state of things finds its complement
in the practical absence of the family among the proletarians, and in public
prostitution.
<a id="102"> </a></p>
<p>The bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement
vanishes, and both will vanish with the vanishing of capital.
<a id="103"> </a></p>
<p>Do you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of children by
their parents? To this crime we plead guilty.
<a id="104"> </a></p>
<p>But, you say, we destroy the most hallowed of relations, when we replace
home education by social.
<a id="105"> </a></p>
<p>And your education! Is not that also social, and determined by the social
conditions under which you educate, by the intervention direct or indirect,
of society, by means of schools, &amp;c.? The Communists have not invented
the intervention of society in education; they do but seek to alter the
character of that intervention, and to rescue education from the influence
of the ruling class.
<a id="106"> </a></p>
<p>The bourgeois clap-trap about the family and education, about the hallowed
co-relation of parents and child, becomes all the more disgusting, the
more, by the action of Modern Industry, all the family ties among the proletarians
are torn asunder, and their children transformed into simple articles of
commerce and instruments of labour.
<a id="107"> </a></p>
<p>But you Communists would introduce community of women, screams the bourgeoisie
in chorus.
<a id="108"> </a></p>
<p>The bourgeois sees his wife a mere instrument of production. He hears
that the instruments of production are to be exploited in common, and,
naturally, can come to no other conclusion that the lot of being common
to all will likewise fall to the women.
<a id="109"> </a></p>
<p>He has not even a suspicion that the real point aimed at is to do away
with the status of women as mere instruments of production.
<a id="110"> </a></p>
<p>For the rest, nothing is more ridiculous than the virtuous indignation
of our bourgeois at the community of women which, they pretend, is to be
openly and officially established by the Communists. The Communists have
no need to introduce community of women; it has existed almost from time immemorial.
<a id="111"> </a></p>
<p>Our bourgeois, not content with having wives and daughters of their
proletarians at their disposal, not to speak of common prostitutes, take
the greatest pleasure in seducing each other’s wives. 
<a id="112"> </a></p>
<p>Bourgeois marriage is, in reality, a system of wives in common
and thus, at the most, what the Communists might possibly be reproached
with is that they desire to introduce, in substitution for a hypocritically
concealed, an openly legalised community of women. For the rest, it is
self-evident that the abolition of the present system of production must
bring with it the abolition of the community of women springing from that system, <i>i.e.</i>,
of prostitution both public and private.
<a id="113"> </a></p>
<p>The Communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish countries
and nationality.
<a id="114"> </a></p>
<p>The working men have no country. We cannot take from them what they
have not got. Since the proletariat must first of all acquire political
supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of the nation, must constitute
itself <i>the</i> nation, it is so far, itself national, though not in
the bourgeois sense of the word.
<a id="115"> </a></p>
<p>National differences and antagonism between peoples are daily more and
more vanishing, owing to the development of the bourgeoisie, to freedom
of commerce, to the world market, to uniformity in the mode of production
and in the conditions of life corresponding thereto.
<a id="116"> </a></p>
<p>The supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster.
United action, of the leading civilised countries at least, is one of the
first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat.
<a id="117"> </a></p>
<p>In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another will
also be put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also
be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within
the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to
an end.
<a id="118"> </a></p>
<p>The charges against Communism made from a religious, a philosophical
and, generally, from an ideological standpoint, are not deserving of serious
examination.
<a id="119"> </a></p>
<p>Does it require deep intuition to comprehend that man’s ideas, views,
and conception, in one word, man’s consciousness, changes with every change
in the conditions of his material existence, in his social relations and
in his social life?
<a id="120"> </a></p>
<p>What else does the history of ideas prove, than that intellectual
production changes its character in proportion as material production is
changed? The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling
class.
<a id="121"> </a></p>
<p>When people speak of the ideas that revolutionise society, they do but
express that fact that within the old society the elements of a new one
have been created, and that the dissolution of the old ideas keeps even
pace with the dissolution of the old conditions of existence.
<a id="122"> </a></p>
<p>When the ancient world was in its last throes, the ancient religions
were overcome by Christianity. When Christian ideas succumbed in the 18th
century to rationalist ideas, feudal society fought its death battle with
the then revolutionary bourgeoisie. The ideas of religious liberty and
freedom of conscience merely gave expression to the sway of free competition
within the domain of knowledge.
<a id="123"> </a></p>
<p>“Undoubtedly,” it will be said, “religious, moral, philosophical, and
juridical ideas have been modified in the course of historical development.
But religion, morality, philosophy, political science, and law, constantly
survived this change.” 
<a id="124"> </a></p>
<p>“There are, besides, eternal truths, such as Freedom, Justice,
etc., that are common to all states of society. But Communism abolishes
eternal truths, it abolishes all religion, and all morality, instead of
constituting them on a new basis; it therefore acts in contradiction to
all past historical experience.” 
<a id="125"> </a></p>
<p>What does this accusation reduce itself to? The history of all
past society has consisted in the development of class antagonisms, antagonisms
that assumed different forms at different epochs.
<a id="126"> </a></p>
<p>But whatever form they may have taken, one fact is common to all past
ages, <i>viz.</i>, the exploitation of one part of society by the other. No wonder,
then, that the social consciousness of past ages, despite all the multiplicity
and variety it displays, moves within certain common forms, or general
ideas, which cannot completely vanish except with the total disappearance
of class antagonisms.
<a id="127"> </a></p>
<p>The Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional
property relations; no wonder that its development involved the most radical rupture
with traditional ideas.
<a id="128"> </a></p>
<p>But let us have done with the bourgeois objections to Communism.
<a id="129"> </a></p>
<p>We have seen above, that the first step in the revolution by the working
class is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling class to win
the battle of democracy.
<a id="130"> </a></p>
<p>The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degree,
all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of production
in the hands of the State, <i>i.e.</i>, of the proletariat organised as the ruling
class; and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible.
<a id="131"> </a></p>
<p>Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means
of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions of
bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear economically
insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip
themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and
are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of production.
<a id="131"> </a></p>
<p>These measures will, of course, be different in different countries.
<a id="132"> </a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will be pretty
generally applicable.
<a id="133"> </a></p>
<p class="indentb">
1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public
purposes.
<br>
2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.
<br>
3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance.
<br>
4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.
<br>
5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national
bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.
<br>
6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands
of the State.
<br>
7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State;
the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the
soil generally in accordance with a common plan.
<br>
8. Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially
for agriculture.
<br>
9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition
of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution
of the populace over the country.
<br>
10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children’s
factory labour in its present form. Combination of education with industrial
production, &amp;c, &amp;c.
<a id="134"> </a></p>
<p>
When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared,
and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association
of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character.
Political power, properly so called, is merely the organised power of one
class for oppressing another. If the proletariat during its contest with
the bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to organise
itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling
class, and, as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of production,
then it will, along with these conditions, have swept away the conditions
for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will
thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class.
<a id="135"> </a></p>
<p>In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms,
we shall have an association, in which the free development of each is the
condition for the free development of all.

The workers of Paris were overwhelmed by superior strength, but they
were not subdued. They have been defeated but their enemies are vanquished.
The momentary triumph of brute force has been purchased with the destruction
of all the delusions and illusions of the February revolution, the dissolution
of the entire moderate republican party and the division of the French
nation into two nations, the nation of owners and the nation of workers.
The tricolor republic now displays only one color, the color of the defeated,
the color of blood. It has become a red republic.

<p>None of the big republican figures, whether of the National or of the Reforme, <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume07/footnote.html#115" target=_blank>[20]</a></sup> sided with the people. In the absence of leaders
and means other than those thrown up by the rebellion itself, the people
stood up to the united forces of the bourgeoisie and army longer than any
French dynast with the entire military apparatus at its disposal was ever
able to stand up to any group of the bourgeoisie allied with the people.
To have the people lose its last illusions and break completely with the
past, it was necessary that the customary poetic trimmings of French uprisings
-- the enthusiastic bourgeois youth, the students of the ecole polytechnique,
the tricornes -- should join the side of the suppressers. The medical students
had to deny the wounded plebeians the succor of their science. Science
does not exist for the plebeian who has committed the heinous, unutterable
crime of fighting this time for his own existence instead of for Louis
Philippe or Monsieur Marrast.

<p>The Executive Committee, <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume07/footnote.html#116" target=_blank>[21]</a></sup> that last official vestige of the
February revolution, vanished like a ghost in the face of these grave events.
Lamartine's fireworks have turned into the incendiary shells of Cavaignac.

<p>Fraternite, the brotherhood of antagonistic classes, one of which
exploits the other, this fraternity which in February was proclaimed and
inscribed in large letters on the facades of Paris, on every prison and
every barracks -- this fraternity found its true, unadulterated and prosaic
expression in civil war, civil war in its most terrible aspect, the war
of labor against capital. This brotherhood blazed in front of the windows
of Paris on the evening of June 25, when the Paris of the bourgeoisie held
illuminations while the Paris of the proletariat was burning, bleeding,
groaning in the throes of death.

<p>This brotherhood lasted only as long as there was a consanguinity
of interests between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Pedants sticking
to the old revolutionary tradition of 1793; socialist doctrinaires who
begged alms for the people from the bourgeoisie and who were allowed to
deliver lengthy sermons and compromise themselves so long as the proletarian
lion had to be lulled to sleep; republicans who wanted to keep the old
bourgeois order in toto, but without the crowned head; members of the Dynastic
Opposition <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume07/footnote.html#117" target=_blank>[22]</a></sup> on whom chance imposed the task of bringing about the downfall
of a dynasty instead of a change of government; legitimists, <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume07/footnote.html#118" target=_blank>[23]</a></sup> who did
not want to cast off their livery but merely to change its style -- these
were the allies with whom the people had fought their February revolution.
What the people instinctively hated in Louis Philip was not Louis Philip
himself, but the crowned rule of a class, the capital on the throne. But
magnanimous as always, the people thought they had destroyed their enemy
when they had overthrown the enemy of their enemies, their common enemy.

<p>The February revolution was the nice revolution, the revolution
of universal sympathies, because the contradictions which erupted in it
against the monarchy were still undeveloped and peacefully dormant, because
the social struggle which formed their background had only achieved an
ephemeral existence, an existence in phrases, in words. The June revolution
is the ugly revolution, the nasty revolution, because the phrases have
given place to the real thing, because the republic has bared the head
of the monster by knocking off the crown which shielded and concealed it.

<p>Order! was Guizot's war-cry. Order! shouted Sebastiani, the Guizotist,
when Warsaw became Russian. Order! shouts Cavaignac, the brutal echo of
the French National Assembly and of the republican bourgeoisie.

<p>Order! thundered his grape-shot as it tore into the body of the
proletariat.

<p>None of the numerous revolutions of the French bourgeoisie since
1789 assailed the existing order, for they retained the class rule, the
slavery of the workers, the bourgeois system, even though the political
form of this rule and this slavery changed frequently. The June uprising
did assail this system. Woe to the June uprising!

<p>Under the Provisional Government it was considered good form and,
moreover, a necessity to preach to the magnanimous workers -- who, as a
thousand official posters proclaimed, "placed three months of misery at
the disposal of the Republic" -- it was both good politics and a sign of
enthusiasm to preach to the workers that the February revolution had been
carried out in their own interests and that the principal issue of the
February revolution was the interests of the workers. With the opening
of the National Assembly the speeches have become more prosaic. Now it
was only a matter of leading labor back to its old conditions, as Minister
Trelat said. Thus the workers fought in February in order to be engulfed
in an industrial crisis.

<p>It is the business of the National Assembly to undo the work of
February, at least as far as the workers are concerned, and to throw them
back to their old conditions. But even this was not done, because it is
not within the power of any assembly any more than of a king to will a
universal industrial crisis -- advance up to this point and no further.
In its crude eagerness to put an end to the tiresome February phraseology,
the National Assembly did not even take the measures that were possible
on the basis of the old conditions. Parisian workers aged 17 to 25 were
either pressed into the army or thrown onto the street; those from other
parts were ordered out of Paris to the Sologne without even receiving the
money that went with such an order; adult Parisians could for the time
being secure a pittance in workshops organized on military lines on condition
that they did not attend any public meetings, in other words on condition
that they ceased to be republicans. Neither the sentimental rhetoric which
followed the February events nor the brutal legislation after May 15 <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume07/footnote.html#49" target=_blank>[24]</a></sup>
achieved their purpose. A real, practical decision had to be taken. For
whom did you make the February revolution, you rascals -- for yourselves
or for us? The bourgeoisie put this question in such a way that it had
to be answered in June with grape-shot and barricades.

<p>The entire National Assembly is nevertheless struck with paralysis,
as one deputy [Ducoux. -- Ed.] put it on June 25. Its members are stunned
when question and answer make the streets of Paris flow with blood; some
are stunned because their illusions are lost in the smoke of gunpowder,
others because they cannot understand how the people dare stand up on their
own for their own vital interests. Russian money, British money, the Bonapartist
eagle, the lily, amulets of all kinds -- this is where they sought an explanation
of this strange event. Both parts of the Assembly feel however that a vast
gulf separates them from the people. None of them dare stand up for the
people.

<p>As soon as the stupor has passed frenzy breaks out. The majority
quite rightly greets with catcalls those hapless utopians and hypocrites
guilty of the anachronism of still using the term fraternite, brotherhood.
The question at issue was precisely that of doing away with this term and
with the illusions arising from its ambiguity. When the legitimist Larochejaquelein,
the chivalrous dreamer, protested against the infamy of those who cried
"Vae victis! Woe to the vanquished!" the majority of the deputies broke
into a St. Vitus's dance as if stung by a tarantula. They shouted woe!
to the workers in order to hide the fact that they themselves are the "vanquished".
Either the Assembly must perish now, or the republic. And that is why it
frantically yells -- long live the republic!

<p>Is the deep chasm which has opened at our feet to mislead us,
democrats, or cause us to believe that the struggle for a form of polity
is meaningless, illusory and futile?

<p>Only weak, cowardly minds can pose such a question. Collisions
proceeding from the very conditions of bourgeois society must be overcome
by fighting, they cannot be reasoned out of existence. The best form of
polity is that in which the social contradictions are not blurred, not
arbitrarily -- that is, merely artificially, and therefore only seemingly
-- kept down. The best form of polity is that in which these contradictions
reach a stage of open struggle in the course of which they are resolved.

<p>We may be asked, do we not find a tear, a sigh, a word for the
victims of the people's wrath, for the National Guard, the mobile guard,
<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume07/footnote.html#120" target=_blank>[25]</a></sup> the republican guard and the line?

<p>The state will care for their widows and orphans, decrees extolling
them will be issued, their remains will be carried to the grave in solemn
procession, the official press will declare them immortal, the European
reaction in the East and the West will pay homage to them.

<p>But the plebeians are tormented by hunger, abused by the press,
forsaken by the physicians, called thieves, incendiaries and galley-slaves
by the respectabilities; their wives and children are plunged into still
greater misery and the best of those who have survived are sent overseas.
It is the right and the privilege of the democratic press to place laurels
on their gloomy threatening brow.

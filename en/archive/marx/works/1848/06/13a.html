<p><i>Cologne, </i>June 11<i>. Both assemblies, the one in Frankfurt and the one in Berlin, have solemnly put on record their admission of incompetence. One assembly, by its vote on the question of Schleswig-Holstein, recognises the Federal Diet as its superior authority.</i><sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume07/footnote.html#55" target=_blank>[55]</a></sup><i> The other, by its decision to reject Deputy Berends’ motion and by passing to the substantiated order of the day, not only repudiates the revolution, a but expressly admits that it is solely empowered to agree upon the Constitution</i> and thereby recognises the basic principle underlying the draft of the Constitution that has been proposed by the Camphausen Government. Both assemblies have given a correct appraisal of their worth. They are both <i>incompetent</i>.</p>

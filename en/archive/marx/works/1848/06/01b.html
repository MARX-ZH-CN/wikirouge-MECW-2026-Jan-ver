<h1>The Assembly at Frankfurt</h1>

<p class="fst">
<b>Cologne, May 31.</b> For a fortnight Germany has had a constituent
National Assembly elected by the German people as a whole.

<p>The German people won its sovereign status by fighting in the
streets of almost all towns in the country, large and small, and especially
on the barricades of Vienna and Berlin. It exercised this sovereignty in
the elections to the National Assembly.

<p>The bold and public proclamation of the sovereignty of the German
people should have been the first act of the National Assembly.

<p>Its second act should have been the drafting of a German constitution
based on the sovereignty of the people and the elimination from the conditions
actually existing in Germany of everything that conflicts with this principle.

<p>During the whole of its session the Assembly ought to have taken
all necessary measures to frustrate any reactionary sallies, to maintain
the revolutionary basis on which it depends and to safeguard the sovereignty
of the people, won by the revolution, against all attacks.

<p>Though the German National Assembly has met about a dozen times
already, it has done none of these things.

<p>But it has ensured the salvation of Germany by the following great
deeds.

<p>The National Assembly realised that it must have rules, for it
knew that when two or three Germans get together they must have a set of
rules, otherwise chair legs will be used to decide matters. And now some
school-master had foreseen this contingency and drawn up special regulations
for this high Assembly. A motion was submitted to adopt this scheme provisionally;
though most deputies had not read it, the Assembly adopted it without more
ado, for what would become of Germany's representatives without regulations?
Fiat reglementum partout et toujours!

<p>Herr Raveaux of Cologne tables a quite simple motion dealing with
conflicts between the assemblies at Frankfurt and at Berlin.3 But the Assembly
debates the final regulations, and although Raveaux's motion is urgent,
the regulations are still more urgent. Pereat mundus, fiat reglementum!
However, the elected philistines in their wisdom cannot refrain from making
a few remarks concerning Raveaux's motion, and while they are debating
whether the regulations or the motion should take precedence, they have
already produced up to two dozen amendments to this motion. They ventilate
the thing, talk, get stuck, raise a din, waste time and postpone voting
from the 19th to the 22nd of May. The matter is brought up again on the
22nd, there is a deluge of new amendments and new digressions, and after
longwinded speeches and endless confusion they decide that the question,
which was already placed on the agenda, is to be referred back to the sections.
Thus the time has happily slipped by and the deputies leave to take their
meal.

<p>On May 23 they first wrangle about the minutes, then have innumerable
motions read out again, and just when they are about to return to the agenda,
that is, to the beloved regulations, Zitz of Mainz mentions the brutalities
of the Prussian army and the despotic abuses of the Prussian commandant
at Mainz.- This was an indubitable and successful sally on the part of
the reaction, an event with which the Assembly was especially competent
to deal. It ought to have called to account the presumptuous soldier who
dared threaten to shell Mainz almost within sight of the National Assembly,
it ought to have protected the unarmed citizens of Mainz in their own houses
from the atrocities of a coarse soldiery which had been forced upon them
and incited against them. But Herr Bassermann, the waterman of Baden [A
pun on the words "Bassermann" and "Wassermann" (waternian). — Ed.], declares
that these are trifles. Mainz must be left to its fate, the whole is more
important, the Assembly meets here to consider a set of regulations in
the interests of Germany as a whole — indeed, what is the shelling of
Mainz compared with this! <i>Pereat Moguntia, fiat reglementum!</i> But the Assembly
is soft-hearted, it elects a commission that is to go to Mainz to investigate
matters and-it is again just time to adjourn and dine.

<p>And then, on May 24, we lose the parliamentary thread altogether.
The regulations would seem to have been completed or to have got lost,
at any rate we hear nothing more about them. Instead we are inundated by
a veritable flood of well-intentioned motions in which numerous representatives
of the sovereign people obstinately demonstrate the limited understanding
of a loyal subject. [5] Then follow applications, petitions, protests,
etc., and in the end the national slops find an outlet in innumerable speeches
skipping from one subject to another. The fact, however, that four committees
have been set up cannot be passed over in silence.

<p>Finally Herr Schloffel asked for the floor. Three German citizens,
Esselen, Pelz and L6wenstein, had been ordered to leave Frankfurt that
very day, before 4 p.m. The wisc and all-knowing police asserted that these
gentlemen had incurred the wrath of the townspeople by their speeches in
the Workers' Association and must therefore clear out. And the police dare
to do this after German right of citizenship was proclaimed by the Preparliament
[6] and even after it was endorsed in the draft constitution of the 17
"trusted men" (hommes de confiance de la diete). [7] The matter is urgent.
Herr Schloffel asks to be allowed to speak on this point. He is refused
permission. He asks for the floor to speak on the urgency of the subject,
which he is entitled to do according to the regulations, but on this occasion
it was a case of <i>fiat politia, pereat reglementum!</i> Naturally, for it was
time to go home and eat.

<p>On the 25th, the flood of tabled motions caused the pensive heads
of the deputies to droop like ripe ears of corn in a downpour. Two deputies
then attempted once more to raise the question of the expulsion, but they
too did not get a chance to speak, even about the urgency of the matter.
Some of the documents received, especially one sent by Poles, were much
more interesting than all the motions of the deputies. Finally the commission
that was sent to Mainz was given the floor. It announced that it could
not report until the following day; moreover it had, of course, arrived
too late: 8,000 Prussian bayonets had restored order by disarming 1,200
men of the Civil Guard. Meantime, there was nothing for it but to pass
on to the agenda. This was done promptly, the item on the agenda being
Raveaux's motion. Since in Frankfurt this had not yet been settled, whereas
in Berlin it had already lost all significance because of Auerswald's decree,
the National Assembly decided to defer the question till the next day and
to go and dine.

<p>On the 26th innumerable new motions were introduced and after
that the Mainz commission delivered its final and very indecisive report.
Herr Hergenhahn, 'ex-people's representative and pro tempore minister,
presented the report. He moved an extremely moderate resolution, but after
a lengthy debate the Assembly concluded that even this docile proposition
was too strong and resolved to leave the citizens of Mainz to the tender
mercies of the Prussians commanded by a Herr Hüser, and "in the hope that
the government will do its duty" the Assembly passed on to the agenda,
that is, the gentlemen left to have a meal.

<p>Finally, on May 27, after lengthy preliminaries over the minutes,
Raveaux's motion was discussed. There was some desultory talk until half
past two and then the deputies went to dine, but this time they assembled
again for an evening session and at last brought the matter to a close.
Because of the extreme tardiness of the National Assembly, Herr Auerswald
had already disposed of Raveaux's motion, therefore Herr Raveaux decided
to support an amendment proposed by Herr Werner, which settled the question
of the people's sovereignty neither in the affirmative nor in the negative.

<p>Our information concerning the National Assembly ends here, but
there is every reason to assume that after having taken this decision the
meeting was adjourned and the deputies went to dine. That they were able
to do this so early, they have to thank Robert Blum, who said:

<p class="quoteb">
"Gentlemen' if you decide to pass on to the agenda today, then the
whole agenda of this Assembly may be cut short in a very curious manner.</p>

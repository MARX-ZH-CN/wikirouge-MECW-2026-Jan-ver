<p><b>Cologne, June 26.</b> The news just received from Paris takes up
so much space that we are obliged to omit all articles of critical comment.</p>
<p>Therefore only a few words to our readers. Our latest news from
Paris gives this: the resignation of Ledru-Rollin and Lamartine and their
ministers; the transfer of Cavaignac's military dictatorship from Algiers
to Paris; Marrast the dictator in plain clothes; Paris bathed in blood;
the insurrection growing into the greatest revolution that has ever taken
place, into a revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie. Three
days which sufficed for the July revolution and the February revolution
are insufficient for the colossal contours of this June revolution, but
the victory of the people is more certain than ever. The French bourgeoisie
has dared to do what the French kings never dared -- it has itself cast
the die. This second act of the French revolution is only the beginning
of the European tragedy.</p>

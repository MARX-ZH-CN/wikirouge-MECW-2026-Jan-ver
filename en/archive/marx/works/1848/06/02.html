<b>Cologne, June 1.</b> Every new organ of public opinion is generally
expected to show enthusiasm for the party whose principles it supports,
unqualified confidence in the strength of this party, and constant readiness
either to use the real power to back the principles, or to use the glamour
of the principles to cover up real weaknesses. We shall not live up to
these expectations. We shall not seek to gild defeats with deceptive illusions.

<p>The democratic party has suffered defeat; the principles which
it proclaimed at the moment of victory are called in question; the ground
it has actually won is being contested inch by inch; much has been lost
already and soon the question will arise — what is left?

<p>What is important for us is that the democratic party should understand
its position. People may ask why we are concerned with a party, why we
do not concentrate on the aims of the democratic movement, the welfare
of the people, the happiness of all without distinction.

<p>For such is the law and usage of struggle, and only from the struggle
of parties can the future welfare arise — not from pseudo-judicious compromises
or from a hypocritical alliance brought about despite conflicting views,
interests and aims.

<p>We demand of the democratic party that it grasp the significance
of its position. This demand springs from the experience of the past months.
The democratic party has allowed the elation of its first victory to go
to its head. Intoxicated with the joy of being able at last to proclaim
its principles openly for all to hear, it imagined that one had merely
to proclaim these principles for them to be immediately realised. It did
not go beyond this proclamation after its first victory and the concessions
which directly followed it. But while the party was lavish with its ideas
and treated as a brother everyone who did not immediately dare to challenge
it, the others — those who retained or obtained power — were active.
And their activity is not to be made light of. Keeping their principles
to themselves and divulging only those parts that were directed against
old conditions already overthrown by the revolution, they carefully held
the movement in check, ostensibly in the interests of the evolving legal
system or the establishment of formal order. They made would-be concessions
to the advocates of the old order to secure their support for their own
plans; then they gradually built up the basic elements of their own political
system and thus succeeded in occupying an intermediate position between
the democratic party and the defenders of absolutism, on the one hand advancing
and on the other retarding the movement, being at once progressive — as
regards the absolutists — and reactionary — as regards the democrats.

<p>In its first intoxication the people's party allowed itself to
be taken in by the party of the prudent, moderate bourgeoisie, till finally
it began to see things in their true light after having been contemptuously
spurned, after all sorts of reprehensible intentions had been imputed to
it, and its members denounced as demagogues. Then it perceived that it
had actually achieved nothing but what the gentlemen of the bourgeoisie
regarded as compatible with their own well-understood interests. Set in
conflict with itself by an undemocratic electoral law and defeated in the
elections, the party now has against it two elected bodies; the only doubtful
thing about them is, which of them will more strongly oppose its demands.
Consequently, the enthusiasm of the party has of course melted away and
has been replaced by the sober recognition of the fact that a powerful
reaction has gained control, and this, strangely enough, happened before
any revolutionary action took place.

<p>Although all this is undoubtedly true, it would be dangerous if
the bitter feeling engendered by the first and partly self-induced defeat
would impel the democratic party now to revert to that wretched idealism,
which is unfortunately characteristic of the German temperament, and according
to which a principle that cannot be put into practice immediately is relegated
to the distant future while for the present its innocuous elaboration is
left to the "thinkers

<p>We must clearly warn against those hypocritical friends who, while
declaring that they agree with the principles, doubt whether they are practicable,
because, they allege, the world is not yet ready for them, and who have
no intention of making it ready, but on the contrary prefer to share the
common lot of the wicked in this wicked earthly life. If these are the
crypto-republicans whom the privy councillor Gervinus fears so much, then
we wholeheartedly agree with him: "Such men are dangerous."

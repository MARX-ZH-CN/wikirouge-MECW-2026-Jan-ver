<p><i>Cologne, </i>June 25, 10 p.m. Letters from Paris have again failed to arrive; the Paris newspapers which came today are those of the 23rd and in the regular course of the postal service they should have arrived already yesterday evening. In these circumstances, the only sources at our disposal are the confused and contradictory reports of Belgian newspapers and our own knowledge of Paris. Accordingly we have tried to give our readers as accurate a picture as possible of the uprising of June 23.</p>
<p>There is no time for further comments. Tomorrow we shall publish a detailed account of our views as well as a detailed report of the meeting of the Paris Chamber on June 23.</p>

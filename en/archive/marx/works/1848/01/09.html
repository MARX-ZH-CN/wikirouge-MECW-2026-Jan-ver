<p>The first issue of <i>The Northern Star</i> for 1848 contains an address to the Irish people by <i>Feargus O'Connor</i>, the well-known leader of the English Chartists and their representative in Parliament. This address deserves to be read from beginning to end and carefully considered by every democrat, but our restricted space prevents us from reproducing it in full.</p>
<p>We would, however, be remiss in our duty if we were to pass it over in silence. The consequences of this forceful appeal to the Irish people will very soon be strongly felt and seen. Feargus O'Connor, himself of Irish descent, a Protestant and for over ten years a leader and main pillar of the great labour movement in England, must henceforth be regarded as the virtual chief of the Irish Repealers<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume06/footnote.html#242" target=_blank>[242]</a></sup> and advocates of reform. His speeches in the House of Commons against the recently published disgraceful Irish Coercion Bill<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume06/footnote.html#243" target=_blank>[243]</a></sup> have given him the first claim to this status, and the subsequently continued agitation for the Irish cause shows that Feargus O'Connor is just the man Ireland needs.</p>
<p><i>O'Connor</i> is indeed seriously concerned about the well-being of the millions in Ireland. Repeal  — the abolition of the Union, that is, the achievement of an independent Irish Parliament — is not an empty word, not a pretext for obtaining posts for himself and his friends and for making profitable private business transactions.</p>
<p>In his address he shows the Irish people that Daniel O'Connell, that political juggler, led them by the nose and deceived them for thirteen years by means of the word “Repeal”.</p>
<p>He shows in its true light the conduct of John O'Connell, who has taken up his father’s political heritage and who like his father is prepared to sacrifice millions of credulous Irishmen for the sake of his personal ventures and interests. All O'Connell’s speeches at the Dublin Conciliation Hall<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume06/footnote.html#244" target=_blank>[244]</a></sup> and all his hypocritical protestations and beautiful phrases will not obliterate the disrepute he has brought upon himself earlier and in particular now in the House of Commons during the debates on the Irish Coercion Bill.</p>
<p>The Irish people must and will see how things stand, and then it will kick out the entire gang of so-called Repealers, who under cover of this cloak laugh up their sleeves and in their purses and John O'Connell, the fanatical papist and political rogue, will be kicked out first of all.</p>
<p>If this were all the address contained, we should not have especially mentioned it.</p>
<p>But it is of much wider importance. For Feargus O'Connor speaks in it not only as an Irishman but also, and primarily, as an English democrat, as a Chartist.</p>
<p>With a lucidity which cannot escape even the most obtuse mind, O'Connor shows that the Irish people must fight with all their might and in close association with the English working classes and the Chartists in order to win the six points of the People’s Charter — annual parliaments, universal suffrage, vote by ballot, abolition of the property qualification for members of Parliament, payment of M.P.s and the establishment of equal electoral districts. Only after these six points are won will the achievement of the Repeal have any advantages for Ireland.</p>
<p>Furthermore O'Connor points out that justice for Ireland has already been demanded earlier by the English workers in a petition which received 3 1/2 million signatures,<sup class="enote"> <a href="../../cw/volume06/footnote.html#245" target=_blank>[245]</a></sup> and that now the English Chartists have again protested against the Irish Coercion Bill in numerous petitions and that the oppressed classes in England and Ireland must at last fight together and conquer together or continue to languish under the same oppression and live in the same misery and dependence on the privileged and ruling capitalist class.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that henceforth the mass of the Irish people will unite ever more closely with the English Chartists and will act with them according to a common plan. As a result the victory of the English democrats, and hence the liberation of Ireland, will be hastened by many years. That is the significance of O'Connor’s address to the Irish people.</p>

<p>In number 36, of this paper, we communicated a rumour circulating in Paris, according to which George Sand was stated to be possessed of papers which placed the Russian refugee, Bakunin, in the position of an agent of the Emperor Nicholas. We gave publicity to this statement, because it was communicated to us simultaneously by two correspondents wholly unconnected with each other. By so doing, we only accomplished the duty of the public press, which has severely to watch public characters. And, at the same time we gave to Mr. Bakunin an opportunity of silencing suspicions thrown upon him in certain Paris circles. We reprinted also from the <i>Allgemeine Oder Zeitung</i> Mr. Bakunin’s declaration, and his letter addressed to George Sand, without waiting for his request. <span class="context">[Neue Rheinische Zeitung No. 46 (supplement), July 16, 1848]</span> We publish now a literal translation of a letter addressed to the Editor of the <i>New</i> <i>Rhenish Gazette, </i>by George Sand, which perfectly settles this affair.</p>
<p class="quoteb">To the editor<br>
Sir,</p>
<p class="quoteb">Under the date line Paris, July 3, you have published the following article (there follows a translation of the relevant item) in your newspaper. The facts conveyed by your correspondent are entirely false and do not have even the slightest semblance of truth. I have never had the smallest scrap of evidence in support of the imputations you seek to make against Mr. Bakunin, who was banished from France by the dethroned King. <span class="context">[Louis Philippe]</span> I have therefore never had any warrant for the slightest doubt about the sincerity of Mr. Bakunin’s character and the honesty of his views.</p>
<p class="quoteb">Yours etc.<br>
<i>George Sand</i></p>
<p class="quoteb">P.S. I appeal to your honour and your conscience to publish this letter immediately in your newspaper.<br>
La Châtre (Dept. Indre), July 20, 1848</p>

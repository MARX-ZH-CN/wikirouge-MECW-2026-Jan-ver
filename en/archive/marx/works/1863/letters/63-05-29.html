<h4>[London,] British Museum, 29 May 1863</h4>
<p><strong>Dear Frederick</strong>,</p>
<p>My long silence will <strong>at once</strong> be explicable to you if you picture to yourself a badly swollen liver with <strong>all its ‘appurtenances’.</strong> For <strong>about</strong> 12 weeks now I have been enduring more of this <strong>nonsense</strong> than ever before. Nor can you have any conception of how it affects a person’s morale, namely the feeling of heaviness in the head and paralysis in the limbs. More specifically, one can’t bring oneself to do anything, not even, <i>inter alia</i>, to write letters. For the past two weeks the thing has again been endurable. This business has made writing of any kind so impossible that, despite various repeated attempts, I have <i>not managed</i> the stuff on Poland, which I'm very glad of now, since it would have simply deprived me of the chance of going to Prussia without being of any immediate benefit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I wasn’t, of course, idle, though unable to work. What I did, on the one hand, was fill in the gaps in my knowledge (diplomatic, historical) of the Russian-Prussian-Polish affair and, on the other, read and make excerpts from all kinds of earlier literature relating to the part of the political economy I had elaborated. This at the <strong>British Museum</strong>. Now that I am more or less able to work again, I shall cast the weight off my shoulders and make a <i>fair copy</i> of the political economy for the printers (and give it a final polish). If it were possible for me to retreat into isolation at the moment, the thing would progress very quickly. <strong>At all events</strong>, I shall take it to Germany in person.</p>
<p>Little Jenny is not quite her proper self. She has had a nasty cough for the past fortnight.</p>
<p>As to Izzy, he had — or so I've been told in confidence by Freiligrath (he showed me Izzy’s letter) — asked F. to write a poem for him on the ‘new’ movement, i.e. sing Izzy’s praises. However, he was mistaken in F. In his letter he says <i>inter alia</i>: ‘Each day hundreds of newspapers carry my name to the furthest corners of Germany.’ ‘My proletarians! etc.’ Well, since F. won’t sing his praises, he has found another poet. Herewith a sample:</p>
<p class="indentb">‘Thou German <i>proletariat</i>, come heed<br>
The clarion call, nor any longer stay!<br>
Here stands a man prepared to pave the way<br>
To thy prosperity. Be thine the <i>deed!</i><br>
He hath no truck with lofty parliaments,<br>
Nor doth he flaunt his gift of eloquence,<br>
Speaks for us all with homely wit and colour,<br>
Man of the People, <i>Ferdinand</i> <i>Lassalle!</i></p>
<p class="indentb">‘Tis not for <i>others</i>, not to fill their purse<br>
That you shall sweat and toil your lives away,<br>
While <i>they</i> wax sleek and richer every day<br>
And you more ragged as your lot grows worse.<br>
The fruits of labour shall be yours alone,<br>
’tis you shall reap the harvest you have sown.<br>
So hearken all unto the man of valour,<br>
To the virile voice of <i>Ferdinand Lassalle</i>.</p>
<p><i>Macte puer</i>! If that isn’t sauce for the gander!</p>
<p>My warm regards to Lupus. Now don’t indulge in tit for tat but let me hear from you soon.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. M.</p>

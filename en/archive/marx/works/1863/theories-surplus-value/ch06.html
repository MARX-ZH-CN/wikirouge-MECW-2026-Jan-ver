<h3>[2.  Circulation between Farmers and
Landowners.  The Return Circuit of Money to the
Farmers, Which Does Not Express Reproduction]</h3>
<p>The farmer first pays 2,000 million francs in money to
the landlord, the <i>propriétaire</i>.  With this,
the landlord buys from the farmer, 1,000 millions worth of
means of subsistence.  1,000 millions therefore flow
back to the farmer in money, while one-fifth of the gross
product is disposed of, passing definitively out of
circulation into consumption.</p>
<p>The landlord next buys, with 1,000 millions in money,
manufactured commodities, non-agricultural products, to the
value of 1,000 millions.  With this purchase, a second
one-fifth of the (in this case manufactured) products falls
out of circulation into consumption.  These 1,000
millions in money are now in the hands of the sterile class,
who buys with them from the farmer 1,000 millions worth of
means of subsistence.  Thus the second 1,000 millions
which the farmer has paid to the landlord in the form of
rent flow back to the farmer.  On the other hand, a
further one-fifth of the farmer’s product has gone to the
sterile class, out of circulation into consumption.  At
the end of this first movement, therefore, we have the 2,000
millions in money back in the hands of the farmer. 
This money has carried through four different processes of
circulation.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, it served as means of payment for
rent.  In this function it does not circulate any part
of the annual product, but is merely a circulating draft on
the part of the gross product which is equal to the
rent.</p>
<p><i>Second</i>, the landlord buys means of subsistence
from the farmer, using half the 2,000 millions, that is,
1,000 millions, thus realising his 1,000 millions in means
of subsistence.  In fact, the farmer merely gets back,
in the 1,000 millions in money, half of the draft he has
given the landlord for two-fifths of his product.  In
this transaction the 1,000 millions, since they serve as
means of purchase, circulate commodities to that amount,
which fall into final consumption.  The 1,000 millions
here serve the landlord only as <i>means of purchase</i>; he
reconverts the money into use-value (commodities, which
however enter into final consumption, and are bought as
use-value).</p>
<p>If we consider purely the isolated act, the money in this
transaction plays merely the role which, as means of
purchase, it always plays for the seller, namely, being the
changed form of his commodity.  The landlord has his
1,000 millions in corn, the farmer has converted into money
corn to the price of 1,000 millions, he has realised its
price.  But if we consider this act in connection with
the preceding act of circulation, the money here does not
appear as a mere metamorphosis of the farmer’s commodity, as
a golden equivalent of his commodity.  The 1,000
millions are in fact only half the 2,000 millions, in money,
which the farmer has paid to the <span class="context">||423|</span> landlord in the form of
rent.  It is true that he gets 1,000 millions in money
for 1,000 millions in commodities, but <i>in so doing in
fact he only buys back the money with which he paid the
landlord the rent; that is to say, the landlord buys, with
the 1,000 millions which he has received from the farmer,
1,000 millions worth of commodities from the farmer. 
He pays the farmer</i> with the money which he has received
<i>from the farmer without any equivalent</i>.</p>
<p>This flowing back of the money to the farmer, taken in
con-junction with the first act, does not at first make it
appear to him a mere means of circulation.  But then it
is different in essence from the flowing back of money to
its starting-point when the movement is an expression of a
process of reproduction.</p>
<p>For example: the capitalist—or, to leave the
characteristics of capitalist reproduction entirely out of
account, a producer— lays out £100 for raw
material, instruments of labour and means of subsistence for
the period of his labour.  We will assume that he does
not add more labour to the means of production than he had
expended on the means of subsistence, the wages that he has
paid to himself.  If the raw material, etc., equals
£80, and the labour added is equal to £20 (the means
of subsistence consumed also being equal to £20), then
the product is equal to £100.  If he now sells it,
the £100 flows back to him in money, and so on. 
This flowing back of the money to its starting-point here
expresses nothing but continuous reproduction.  The
simple metamorphosis in this case is M—C—M,
transformation of money into commodity and retransformation
of commodity into money— this mere change of form of
money and commodity here representing at the same time the
process of reproduction.  Money is transformed into
commodities, <i>means of production</i> and means of
subsistence; then these commodities enter as elements into
the labour-process and emerge from it as a product. 
Thus a commodity appears again as a result of the process,
that is, when the finished product re-enters the process of
circulation, and by so doing again confronts money as a
commodity; and finally it is reconverted into money, since
the finished commodity can only be exchanged again for its
production elements after it has first been transformed into
money.</p>
<p>The constant flowing back of the money to its
starting-point expresses here not only the formal conversion
of money into commodity and commodity into money—as in
the simple process of circulation or the mere exchange of
goods—<i>but at the same time the continuous
reproduction of the commodity by the same
producer</i>.  Exchange-value (money) is converted into
commodities which enter into consumption, and are consumed
as use-values; they pass however into reproductive or
industrial consumption, therefore reproduce the original
value and consequently reappear in the <i>same</i> amount of
money (in the above example, in which the producer labours
only for his own maintenance), M—C—M here shows
that M is not only formally converted into C, but C is
actually consumed as a use-value, falling out of circulation
into consumption, but into industrial consumption, so that
its value is maintained and reproduced in consumption, and M
therefore reappears at the end of the process, being
maintained in the movement M—C—M.</p>
<p>In contrast with this, in the case given above, no
reproduction process takes place when the money flows back
from the landlord to the farmer.  It is as if the
farmer had given the landlord tokens or tickets for products
to the value of 1,000 millions.  When the landlord
cashes these tokens, they flow back to the farmer and he
redeems them.  If the landlord had had half the rent
paid directly in kind, no circulation of money would have
taken place.  The whole circulation would have been
limited to a simple change of hands, the transfer of the
product from the farmer’s hand to the landlord’s. 
First the farmer gives the landlord the money instead of the
commodity, and then the landlord returns the money to the
farmer in order to take the commodity itself.  The
money serves the farmer as <i>means of payment</i> to the
landlord; it serves the landlord as <i>means of purchase</i>
in relation to the farmer.  In the first function it
moves away from the farmer, in the second it comes back to
him.</p>
<p>This type of return flow of the money to the producer
must always take place whenever he pays his creditors,
instead of a part of his product, its value in money; and
everyone who is a co-proprietor of his surplus is in this
respect a creditor.  For example: all taxes are paid by
the producers in money.  In this transaction the money
is for them means of payment to the State.  With this
money the State buys commodities from the producers. 
In the hands of the State it is a means of purchase, and
thus returns to the producers in the same measure as they
part with their commodities.</p>
<p>This type of return flow—this peculiar flowing back
of money that is not determined by reproduction—must
take place in all cases where there is exchange of revenue
for capital.  What makes the money flow back in such
cases is not reproduction but consumption.  The revenue
is paid in money, but it can only be consumed in
commodities.  The money which is received from the
producers as revenue must therefore be paid back to them in
order to obtain the same amount of value in commodities,
that is, in order to consume the revenue.  The money in
which revenue is paid—rent for example, or interest or
taxes, &lt;the <span class="context">||424 |</span>
industrial capitalist pays his revenue to himself in the
product, or from the sale of the product that part of it
which forms his revenue&gt;—has the general form of
means of payment.  The person who pays the revenue is
supposed to have received from his creditor a part of his
own product—for example, in the case of the farmer,
the two-fifths of the product which according to Quesnay
constitute the rent.  He is only its nominal or <i>de
facto</i> owner.</p>
<p>The part of the farmer’s product, therefore, which
constitutes his rent, requires for its circulation between
farmer and landlord only an amount of money equal to the
value of the product, although this value circulates
twice.  First the farmer pays the rent in money; then
with the same money the landlord buys the product.  The
first is a simple transfer of money, since the money
functions only as <i>means of payment;</i> the assumption is
therefore that the commodity for which it is paid is already
in the hands of the payer and does not serve him as a means
of purchase; that he receives no equivalent for the money,
but on the contrary has this equivalent in advance.  In
the second transaction, on the other hand, the money
functions as means of purchase, means of circulation for
commodities.  It is as if, with the money in which he
pays his rent, the farmer had bought the landlord’s share in
the product.  The landlord, with the same money that he
has thus received from the farmer (who however in fact has
given it away without any equivalent), buys the product back
again from the farmer.</p>
<p>The same sum of money, therefore, which is handed over by
the producers to the owners of revenue in the form of means
of payment, serves the owners of revenue as means of
purchase for the producers’ commodities.  This twofold
change of place of the money—from the hands of the
producer into the hands of the owner of revenue, and from
the latter’s hands back into the hands of the
producer—thus expresses only a single change of place
on the part of the commodity, that is, from the hands of the
producer into the hands of the owner of revenue, Since the
producer is supposed to owe a part of his product to the
owner of revenue, the money-rent that he pays him is in fact
only a retrospective payment for the value of the commodity
which has already passed into his possession.  The
commodity is in his hands; but it does not belong to
him.  With the money that he pays in the form of
revenue, he therefore redeems it making it his
property.  Therefore the commodity does not change
hands.  When the money changes hands, this represents
only a <i>change in the title of ownership</i> of the
commodity, which remains in the hands of the producer as
before.  Hence this twofold change of place of the
money with only a single change of hands for the
commodity.  The money circulates twice, in order to
make the commodity circulate once.  But it too
circulates only once as means of circulation (means of
purchase), while the other time it circulates as means of
payment; in which type of circulation, as I have shown
above, no simultaneous change of place between commodity and
money takes place.</p>
<p>In fact, if the farmer has no money in addition to his
product, he can only pay for his product after he has first
sold his commodity, and it has therefore already passed
through its first metamorphosis before he can pay it out as
money to the landlord.  Even taking this into account,
there are more changes of place on the part of the money
than on the part of the commodity.  First C—M [is
carried through]; two-fifths of the commodity is sold and
transformed into money.  Here there is the simultaneous
exchange of commodity and money.  Then however this
same money, without being exchanged for a commodity, passes
from the hands of the farmer into those of the
landlord.  Here there is a change of place of the
money, but no change of place of the commodity.  It is
the same as if the farmer had a co-partner.  He has
received the money, but he must share it with his
co-partner.  Or rather, for the two-fifths it is more
as if a servant of the farmer has received the money. 
This servant must give it to the farmer, he cannot retain it
in his own pocket.  In this instance the movement of
the money from one hand to the other does not express any
kind of metamorphosis of the commodity, but is a mere
transfer of the money from the hand of its immediate
possessor into the hand of its owner.  This can
therefore be the case when the man who first receives the
money is merely an agent for his employer.  Then the
money is also not a means of payment— there is a
simple transfer of it from the hand of the receiver, to whom
it does not belong, into the hand of the owner.</p>
<p>This kind of change of place of money has absolutely
nothing to do with the metamorphosis of the commodity, any
more than has the change of place arising from the mere
conversion of one kind of money into another kind. 
With a means of payment, however, it is always implied that
the payer has received a commodity for which he subsequently
pays.  In the case of the farmer, etc., he has <i>not
received</i> this commodity; it is in his hands before it is
in the landlord’s hands, and it is a part of <i>his</i>
product.  But <i>in law</i> he becomes its owner only
by handing over to the landlord the money received for
it.  His legal title to the commodity changes; the
commodity itself is in his hands both before and
after.  But first it was in his hands as something
<i>in his possession</i> but the owner of which was the
landlord.  It is now in his hands as his own
property.  The change in the legal form while the
commodity remains in the same hands has naturally not caused
the commodity itself to change hands.</p>

<h3>[3.  On the Circulation of Money between Capitalist
and Labourer]</h3>
<p><a id="s3a"> </a></p>
<h4>[(a) The Absurdity of Speaking of Wages as an Advance by
the Capitalist to the Labourer.  Bourgeois Conception
of Profit as Reward for Risk]</h4>
<p><span class="context">||425|</span> &lt;This also makes
it clear how absurd it is to “explain” the
profit of the capitalist from the fact that he advances
money to the labourer before he has converted the commodity
into money.</p>
<p><i>First:</i> When I buy a commodity for my own
consumption I get no “profit” because I am the
buyer and the owner of the commodity is the
“seller”, because my commodity has the form of
money and his must first be transformed into money. 
The capitalist pays for the labour only after he has
consumed it, while other commodities are paid for before
they are consumed.  This arises from the peculiar
nature of the commodity which he buys, and which is in fact
only delivered after it is consumed.  The money here
has the form of means of payment.  The capitalist has
always appropriated to himself the commodity
“labour” <i>before</i> he pays for it.  The
fact however that he only buys it in order to make a profit
out of the resale of its product is no <i>reason</i> for his
making this profit.  It is a motive.  And it would
mean nothing but: he makes a profit by buying wage-labour
<i>because</i> he wants to make a profit out of selling it
again.</p>
<p><i>Secondly:</i> But he does nevertheless advance to the
labourer in the form of money the part of the product which
is his share as wages, and thus saves the latter himself the
trouble and risk and time involved in converting into money
the part of the commodity which is due to him as
wages.  Is the labourer not to pay him for this
trouble, this risk, and this time, and on this account to
accept less of the product than he would otherwise get?</p>
<p>This would upset the whole relationship between
wage-labour and capital, and destroy the economic
justification of surplus-value.  The result of the
process is in fact that the fund from which the capitalist
pays the wage-labourer is nothing but the latter’s own
product, and that therefore capitalist and labourer
<i>actually</i> share the product in aliquot parts. 
But this actual result has absolutely nothing to do with the
transaction between capital and wage [-labour](on which
rests the economic justification of surplus-value, the
justification founded on the laws of commodity exchange
itself).  What the capitalist buys is the temporary
right to dispose of labour-power; he only pays for it when
this labour-power has taken effect, materialised itself in a
product.  Here, as in all cases where money functions
as means of payment, purchase and sale precede the real
handing over of the money by the buyer.  But the labour
<i>belongs</i> to the capitalist after that transaction,
which has been completed before the actual process of
production begins.  The <i>commodity</i> which emerges
as product from this process belongs entirely to him. 
He has produced it with means of production belonging to him
and with labour which he has bought and which therefore
belongs to him, even though it has not yet been paid
for.  It is the same as if he had not consumed anyone
else’s labour in the production of the commodity.</p>
<p>The profit that the capitalist makes, the surplus-value
which he realises, springs precisely from the fact that the
labourer has sold to him not labour realised in a commodity,
but his labour-power itself as a commodity.  If he had
confronted the capitalist in the first form, as a possessor
of commodities, the capitalist would not have been able to
make any profit, to realise any surplus-value, since
according to the law of value exchange is between
equivalents, an equal quantity of labour for an equal
quantity of labour.  The capitalist’s surplus arises
precisely from the fact that he buys from the labourer not a
commodity but his labour-power itself, and this has less
value than the product of this labour-power, or, what is the
same thing, realises itself in more materialised labour than
is realised in itself.  But now, in order to justify
profit, its very source is covered up, and the whole
transaction from which it springs is repudiated. 
Because in fact—once the process is
continuous—the capitalist only pays the labourer out
of his own product, the labourer is only paid with <i>a
part</i> of his own product, and the advance is therefore a
mere pretence, we are now told that the labourer has sold
his share in the product to the capitalist, <i>be fore it
has been converted into money</i>.  (Perhaps before it
was capable of being converted into money, for although the
workman’s labour had materialised itself in a product, it
may be that only one part of the vendible commodity has as
yet been realised, for example, [only] part of a house.) So
the capitalist is no longer owner of the product, and
thereby the whole process through which he has appropriated
another’s labour gratis is invalidated.  Now therefore
owners of commodities confront each other.  The
capitalist has money, and the labourer sells him not his
labour-power but a commodity, namely, the part of the
product in which his own labour is realised.</p>
<p>He [the labourer] will now say to the capitalist:
“Of these 5 lbs. of twist, say three-fifths represent
constant capital.  They belong to you. 
Two-fifths, that is, 2 lbs., represent my newly-added
labour.  Therefore you have to pay me the 2 lbs. 
So pay me the value of 2 lbs.”  And thereby he
would pocket not only the wages but also the profit, in
short, a sum of money equal to the quantity of labour newly
added by him and materialised in the form of the 2 lbs.</p>
<p>“But,” says the capitalist, “have I not
advanced the constant capital?”</p>
<p>“Well,” says the labourer, “you deduct
the 3 lbs. for it, and pay me only 2.”</p>
<p>“But,” insists the capitalist, “you
couldn’t materialise your labour, you couldn’t spin, without
my cotton and my spindles.  You must pay extra for
that.”</p>
<p>“Well,” says the labourer, “the cotton
would have rotted and the spindles rusted if I hadn’t used
them for spinning.  <span class="context">||426|</span>
The 3 lbs. of yarn which you are deducting do represent, it
is true, only the value of your cotton and spindles which
were used up, and are therefore contained, in the 5 lbs. of
yarn.  But it is only my labour that has maintained the
value of cotton and spindles unchanged, by using these means
of production as means of production.  I’m not charging
you anything for this value-maintaining power of my labour,
because it didn’t cost me any extra labour-time beyond the
spinning itself, for which I get the 2 lbs.  It’s
natural faculty of my labour which costs me nothing, though
it maintains the value of the constant capital.  As I
don’t charge you anything for it, you can’t charge me for
not being able to spin <i>without</i> spindles and
cotton.  For without spinning, your spindles and cotton
wouldn’t be worth a brass farthing.”</p>
<p>Driven into a corner, the capitalist says: “The 2
lbs. of yarn are in fact worth 2s.  They represent that
much labour-time of yours.  But am I to pay you for
them before I have sold them?  Perhaps I may not sell
them at all.  That is risk No. 1.  Secondly,
perhaps I may sell them at less than their price.  That
is risk No. 2.  And thirdly, in any case it takes time
to sell them.  Am I to take on both risks on your
behalf <i>without recompense</i> and lose my time into the
bargain?  You can’t expect something for
nothing.”</p>
<p>“Wait a bit!” replies the labourer,
“what’s the relation between us?  We face each
other <i>as owners of commodities, you as buyer, we as
sellers</i>, for you want to buy our share in the product,
the 2 lbs., and it in fact contains nothing but our own
materialised labour-time.  Now you assert that we must
sell you our commodity <i>below</i> its value, so that as a
result you would be getting more value in commodity than you
now have in money.  The value of our commodity is equal
to 2s.  You want to give only 1s. for it, so
that—since 1s. contains as much labour-time as 1
lb. of yarn —you would get from the exchange twice as
much value as you give in return.  We on the other hand
would get, instead of an equivalent, only half an
equivalent, an equivalent f or only 1 lb. of yarn instead of
2 lbs.  And on what do you base this demand, which is
contrary to the law of value and the exchange of commodities
in proportion to their value?  On what?  On the
fact that you are buyer and we are seller, that our value is
in the form of yarn, of a commodity, and your value is in
the form of money —that the same value in the form of
yarn confronts the same value in the form of money. 
But, my good friend, that is in fact a mere change of form,
which affects the way in which the value is <i>expressed</i>
but leaves the <i>amount of value</i> unaltered.  Or do
you hold the childish view that every commodity must be sold
<i>under</i> its price, that is to say, for less than the
sum of money which represents its value, because in the form
of money it gets an <i>increased</i> value?  But no,
good friend, it does not get any increased value; the
magnitude of its value does not change, it merely takes the
shape of exchange-value in its pure form.</p>
<p>“Besides, my good friend, think of the troubles you
are laying up for yourself by taking this line.  For
what you assert amounts to this —that the seller must
always sell his commodity to the <i>buyer below</i> its
value.  Indeed as far as you are concerned, this was
the case earlier when we sold you not a commodity we
produced but our labour-power itself.  It is true that
you bought it at its value, but you bought our actual labour
<i>below</i> the value in which it is expressed. 
However that’s an unpleasant memory—let’s say no more
about it.  We’ve got beyond that, thank goodness,
since—by your own decision—we are no longer to
sell you our labour-power as a commodity, but the commodity
itself which is the product of our labour.  Let’s look
at the troubles you’re laying up for yourself.  The new
law you have set up—that the seller pays for the
conversion of his commodity into money not with his
commodity, through the exchange of his commodity for money,
but that he pays for it by selling the commodity
<i>below</i> its price—this law by which the buyer
always fleeces and defrauds the seller must hold good in
like measure for every buyer and seller.  Let’s suppose
that we accept your offer—but on the condition that
you yourself submit to the law just created by you, namely
the law that the seller must surrender to the buyer a part
of his commodity <i>for nothing</i>, in return for the buyer
changing it into money for him.  Then you buy our 2
lbs., which are worth 2s., for 1<i>s</i>.  and thus
make a profit of 1<i>s</i>.  or 100 percent.  But
now you have 5 lbs. of yarn, of a value of 5s., after you
have bought the 2 lbs. belonging to us.  Now you think
you’re going to do a good stroke of business.  The 5
lbs. cost you only 4s., and you’re going to sell them for
5s.  ‘Wait a minute!’ says <i>the man who
buys from you</i>, ‘your 5 lbs. of yarn is a
commodity, and you are a seller.  I have the same value
in money and I am a buyer.  Consequently, by the law
which you recognise I must make 100 per cent profit out of
you.  You must therefore sell me the 5 lbs. of yarn at
50 per cent below its value, for 2s. 6d.  I’ll give you
then 2s.  6d. and get in exchange a commodity to the value
of 5s., and thus make 100 per cent profit out of you, for
what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the
gander.’</p>
<p>“So you see, my good friend, [continues the worker]
where you get with your new law; you would simply have
diddled yourself, since although at one moment you are a
buyer, the next you’re in turn a seller.  In this
particular case you would lose more as a seller than you
gained as a buyer.  And don’t forget this too—
before the 2 lbs. of yarn you want now to buy from us ever
existed, didn’t you make other purchases in advance, but for
which the 5 lbs. of yarn would never have been there at
all?  <span class="context">||426a |</span> Didn’t you
buy cotton and spindles in advance, which are now
represented by .3 lbs. of yarn?  At that time the
cotton jobber in Liverpool and the spindle maker in Oldham
faced you as <i>sellers</i>, and you faced them as
<i>buyer;</i> they represented commodity, you
money—exactly the same relationship as we have the
honour or the misfortune to stand in to each other at this
moment.  Wouldn’t the sharp cotton jobber and your
jovial colleague from Oldham have had a good laugh at you,
if you had demanded that they hand over to you <i>for
nothing</i> a part of the cotton and spindles, or what is
the same thing, sell you these commodities below their price
(and their value), on the ground that you were transforming
commodities for them into money but they were transforming
money into commodities for you, that they were sellers, you
buyer?  They risked nothing, for they got ready money,
exchange-value in the pure, independent form.  You, on
the other hand, what a risk you were taking!  First you
had to make spindles and cotton into yarn, run all the risks
of the production process, and then finally the risk of
reselling the yarn, changing it back again into money! 
The risk whether it would sell at its value, or over or
under its value.  The risk of not selling it at all, of
not transforming it back into money; and as to its quality
as yarn, you didn’t care a straw for it.  You did not
eat yarn, nor drink it, nor have any use whatever for it
except selling it!  And in any case the loss of time,
in transforming the yarn again into money, and that includes
therefore the transformation of spindles and yarn into
money.  ‘Old boy,’ your colleagues will
reply, ‘don’t make a fool of yourself.  Don’t
talk nonsense.  What the devil do we care what you
propose turning our cotton and our spindles to?  What
use you destine them for!  Burn them, hang them, if you
like, throw them to the dogs, but pay for them!  The
idea!  We are to make you a present of our goods
because you have set up as a cotton spinner, and seem not to
feel quite at ease in that line of business, and magnify to
yourself its risks and perilous chances!  Give up
cotton spinning, or don’t come into the market with such
preposterous ideas!’”</p>
<p>The capitalist, with a supercilious smile, replies to
this tirade from the labourers: “Evidently you people
are a bit out of your depth.  You’re talking about
things you don’t understand.  Do you imagine I’ve paid
ready money to the Liverpool ruffian and the chap in
Oldham?  The devil I did.  I’ve paid them in bills
of exchange, and the Liverpool ruffian’s cotton was in point
of fact spun and sold before his bill fell due.  With
you it’s another affair altogether.  You want to get
ready money.”</p>
<p>“Very well,” say the labourers, “and
what did the Liverpool ruffian and the Oldham chap do with
your bills?”</p>
<p>“What they were doing therewith?” says the
capitalist.  “Stupid question!  They lodged
them with their bankers and got them there
discounted.”</p>
<p>“How much did they pay the banker?”</p>
<p>“Let me see!  Money is now very cheap.  I
think they paid something like 3 per cent discount; that is
to say, not 3 per cent on the sum, but they paid so much on
the sum for the time the bill was running as would have come
up to 3 per cent on the whole matter if the bill had run for
a whole year.”</p>
<p>“Still better,” say the working men.
“Pay us 2s., the value of our commodity—or say
12s. as we have dealt today per day, but we will deal per
week.  But take away from that sum 3 per cent per annum
for fourteen days.”</p>
<p>“But this bill is too small,” says the
capitalist, “to be discounted by any
banker.”</p>
<p>“Well,” reply the working men, “we are
100 men.  Thus you have to pay to us 1,200
shillings.  Give us a bill for them.  This makes
£60 and is not too small a sum to be discounted; but
besides, as you discount it yourself, the sum must not be
too small for you, since it is the identical sum whence you
pretend to derive your profit on us.  The amount
deducted wouldn’t he worth mentioning.  And since we
would thus get the major part of our product in its
entirety, we would soon reach the point when we didn’t need
you to discount it for us.  Naturally we will not give
you longer credit than the fourteen days the stock jobber
gives you.”</p>
<p>If—turning the actual relationship
upside-down—wages are to be derived from the discount
on the part of the value of the total product that belongs
to the workmen—that is, from the fact that the
capitalist pays them this part in advance in
<i>money</i>—he would have to give them very
short-term bills of exchange, such as for example he pays to
the cotton jobber, etc.  The workman would get the
largest share of his product, and the capitalist would soon
cease being a capitalist.  From being the owner of the
product he would become merely the workmen’s banker.</p>
<p>Moreover, just as the capitalist takes the risk of
selling the commodity below its <span class="context">||427|</span> value, he equally takes the
chance of selling it above its value.  The workman will
he thrown out onto the street if the product is unsalable;
and if it falls for long below the market-price, his wages
will be brought down below the average and short time will
be worked.  It is he, therefore, that runs the greatest
risk.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly:</i> It never enters anyone’s head to suggest
that the farmer, because he has to pay rent in money, or the
industrial capitalist, because he has to pay interest in
money —and therefore in order to pay them must first
have converted his product into money—is on that
account entitled to deduct a part of his rent or his
interest.&gt;</p>

<h4>[(b) Commodities Which the Labourer Buys from the
Capitalist.  A Return Flow of the Money Which Does Not
Indicate Reproduction]</h4>
<p>In that part of the capital which circulates between
industrial capitalist and labourer (that is, the part of the
circulating capital which is equal to the variable capital),
there is also a return flow of the money to its
starting-point.  The capitalist pays the labourer his
wages in money; with this money the labourer buys
commodities from the capitalist, and so the money flows back
to the capitalist.  (In practice, to the capitalist’s
banker.  But the bankers in fact represent, in relation
to the individual capitalist, the aggregate capital in so
far as it takes the form of <i>money</i>.)  This return
flow of the money does not in itself indicate any
reproduction.  The capitalist buys labour from the
labourer with money; with the same money, the labourer buys
commodities from the capitalist.  The same money takes
the form first of means of purchase for labour, and later on
as means of purchase for commodities.  That it comes
back to the capitalist is due to the fact that at first he
is a buyer, and then in turn, in relation to the same
parties, he is a seller.  He parts with it as a buyer;
it returns to him as a seller.  The labourer on the
contrary is first seller and then buyer, so first he gets
the money and then he pays it out, while in relation to him
the capitalist first pays it out and then takes it in.</p>
<p>For the capitalist, the movement here is
M—C—M.  He buys a commodity (labour-power)
with money; with the product of this labour-power (a
commodity) he buys money; in other words, he sells this
product in turn to his former seller, the labourer. 
For the labourer, on the other hand, the movement of
circulation is C—M—C.  He sells his
commodity (labour-power), and with the money he gets for it
he buys back a part of his own product (a commodity). 
It could indeed be said that the labourer sells a commodity
(labour-power) for money, spends this money on commodities,
and then sells his labour-power again, so that for him too
the movement is M—C—M; and since the money is
constantly fluctuating between him and the capitalist, it
could equally be said, depending on whether one considers it
from the standpoint of the one or of the other, that for him
as well as for the capitalist the movement is
M—C—M.  The capitalist, however, is the
buyer.  The renewal of the process starts from him, not
from the labourer, while the return flow of the money is
compulsory, since the labourer must buy means of
subsistence.  Here, as in all movements where the form
of circulation on one side is M—C—M and on the
other C—M—C, it is made evident that the aim of
the process of exchange on one side is exchange-value,
money—and therefore its increase—and on the
other side use-value, consumption.  This also is the
case when the money flows back as in the example first
considered, where on the farmer’s side the movement is
M—C—M, C—M—C on the landlord’s side;
taking into account the fact that the M with which the
landlord buys from the farmer is the money form of the rent,
and therefore the result of a movement C—M, the
changed form of the part of the product that at bottom
belongs to the landlord in kind.</p>
<p>This M—C—M, in so far as it merely expresses,
as between labourer and capitalist, the return to the latter
of the money laid out by him in wages, in itself does not
indicate any reproduction process, but only that the two
parties are in turn buyer and seller in relation to each
other.  Nor does it represent money as capital, in such
a way as in M—C—M', where the second M' would be
a larger sum of money than the first M, so that M represents
value (capital) which increases in value.  On the
contrary, it merely expresses the formal return of <i>the
same</i> amount of money (often even less) to its
starting-point.  (By capitalist here, of course, is
meant the class of capitalists.) I was therefore wrong in
saying in the first Part that the form M—C—M
must always be M—C—M'.  It may express
merely the formal return of the money, as I indicated there
already, by showing that the return circuit of the money to
the same starting-point arises from the fact that the buyer
in turn becomes seller.</p>
<p>It is not <i>this</i> return movement of the money that
enriches the capitalist.  For example, say that he has
paid 10s. for wages.  The labourer buys goods from him
with this 10s.  He has given the labourer goods to the
value of 10s. for his labour-power.  If he had given
him means of subsistence in kind to the price of 10s., there
would have been no circulation of money, and therefore no
return flow of money.  This phenomenon of money
returning has therefore nothing to do with the enrichment of
the capitalist, which only arises from the fact that in the
production process itself the capitalist appropriates more
labour than he has expended in wages, and that his product
is consequently larger than the costs of producing it; while
the money that he pays the labourer can in no case be less
than the money with which the labourer buys goods from
him.  This formal return of the money has nothing to do
with making a profit, and therefore M here does not signify
capital <span class="context">||428|</span> any more than an
increase or replacement of value takes place when money
spent in rent, interest or taxes flows back to the payer of
rent, interest and taxes.</p>
<p>M—G—M, in so far as it represents the formal
return of money to the capitalist, only means that his
promissory note issued in money is realised in his own
commodity.</p>
<p>As an example of the wrong explanation of this money
circuit—this return of money to its
starting-point—see Destutt de Tracy above.  As a
second example, with special reference to the circulation of
money between labourer and capitalist, Bray is to be quoted
later.  Finally, <i>Proudhon</i>, in regard to the
money-lending capitalist.</p>
<p>This form of return circuit M—C—M is found
wherever the buyer becomes in turn seller, and therefore in
the movement of all commercial capital, where all dealers
buy from each other in order to sell, and sell in order to
buy.  It is possible that the buyer—M—is
unable to sell the commodity, rice for example, at a higher
price than he bought it at; he may have to sell it below its
price.  Thus in such a case a simple return of the
money takes place, because the purchase turns into a sale
without the M having established itself as value that
increases value, that is, as capital.</p>
<p>It is the same for example in the exchange of constant
capital.  The machine builder buys iron from the
producer of iron and sells him machines.  In this case
the money flows back.  It was paid out as means of
purchase for the iron.  It then serves the iron
producer as means of purchase for machines, and so flows
back to the machine builder.  The latter has got iron
for the money he paid out; he has delivered machines for the
money he received.  The same money has circulated twice
its value.  For example, the machine builder buys iron
with £1,000; with the same £1,000 the iron
producer buys machinery.  The value of the iron and the
machinery together is £2,000.  In this way,
however, £3,000 must be in motion: £1,000 money,
£1,000 machinery and £1,000 iron.  If the
capitalists made an exchange in kind, the commodities would
change hands without a farthing circulating.</p>
<p>It is the same when they have reciprocal accounting and
the money serves them as means of payment.  If paper
money or credit money (bank-notes) circulate, then there is
one difference in the transaction.  £1,000 still
exist in bank-notes, but they have no intrinsic value. 
In any case here too there are three [times £1,000]:
£1,000 iron, £1,000 machinery, £1,000 in
bank-notes.  But as in the first case these three only
exist because the machine builder has had [£l,000]
twice—machinery £1,000 and money— in gold
and silver or bank-notes—£l,000.  In both
cases the iron producer returns to him only number two (the
money); because the only reason why he received it at all
was that the machine builder, as buyer, did not immediately
become seller; he did not pay for the first commodity, the
iron, in commodities, and so he paid for it in money. 
When he pays for it in commodities, that is, when he sells
commodities to the ironmaster, the latter returns the money
to him because payment has not to be made twice, once in
money, and the second time in commodities.</p>
<p>In both cases the gold or the bank-note represents the
changed form of a commodity previously bought by the machine
builder or some other person, or perhaps of a commodity that
has been converted into money even though it has not yet
been bought (as in the case of revenue), such as the
landlord (his forebears, etc.) represents.  Here the
flowing back of the money only indicates that the person who
has paid out the money for commodities, the person who has
thrown the money into circulation, pulls back the money out
of circulation by the sale of another commodity that he
throws into circulation.</p>
<p>The very same £1,000 we are thinking of could in
one day pass through forty or fifty hands, from capitalist
to capitalist, and [it would] only transfer capital from one
to the other.  Machinery [goes] to the iron producer,
iron to the peasant, grain to the maker of starch or
spirits, and so on.  In the end it might again come
into the hands of the machine builder, and pass from him to
the iron producer, and so on, and thus it might circulate a
capital of £40,000 or more and might continually flow
back to whoever first paid it out.  M. Proudhon
concludes from this that that part of the profit made on
this £40,000 which consists of interest on money, and
is therefore paid out by the different capitalists
—for example, by the machine builder to the man who
lent him £1,000, by the iron producer to the man who
lent him £1,000 which he spent long ago for coal,
etc., or in wages, etc.—that these £1,000 yield
the <i>total interest</i> that the £40,000 brings
in.  So that if the interest was 5 per cent,
£2,000 in interest.  From which he makes the
correct calculation that the £1,000 have brought in
200 per cent.  And he is a critic of political economy
par excellence!<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">*</a></p>
<p>But although M—C—M, representing the money
circulation between capitalist and labourer, in itself does
not imply any act of reproduction, nevertheless this is
implied by the continuous repetition of this act, the
continuity of the return circuit.  There cannot be a
buyer continually becoming a seller without the reproduction
of the commodity which he sells.  In fact, this holds
good for everyone except those who live on rent or interest
or taxes.  But in some cases the return movement
M—C—M always takes place if the transaction is
to be completed—as in the case of the capitalist in
relation to the labourer, or landlord or money-lender (with
these latter, there is a simple return of the money). 
In other cases the act is completed when commodities are
bought, when the movement C—M—C has been
concluded, as in the case of the labourer.  It is this
act which he continually renews.  His initiative is
always as seller, not as buyer.  The same holds good
for all money circulation <span class="context">||429|</span> which is merely expenditure of
revenue.  The capitalist himself, for example, consumes
a certain amount each year.  He has converted his
commodity into money, in order to pay out this money for
commodities which he wants for his final consumption. 
Here there is C—M—C, and there is no return of
the money to him; but the return is to the seller (the
shopkeeper for example), whose capital is replaced by the
expenditure of revenue.</p>
<p>Now we have seen that an exchange takes place, a
circulation of revenue against revenue.  The butcher
buys bread from the baker; the baker meat from the butcher;
both consume their revenue.  They do not pay for the
meat that the butcher himself eats or the bread that the
baker himself eats.  Each of them consumes this part of
his revenue in kind.  It is however possible that the
meat bought by the baker from the butcher replaces not the
latter’s capital but his revenue—that part of the meat
sold by him which not only represents his profit but the
part of his profit which he wants to consume himself, as
revenue.  The bread that the butcher buys from the
baker is also an expenditure of his revenue.  If the
two run accounts with each other, one or the other of them
has only to pay the balance.  There is no money
circulated in respect of the part of their reciprocal
purchases and sales which balances out.  Let us however
assume that the baker has to pay the balance and that this
balance represents revenue for the butcher.  Then he
spends the money from the baker on other articles of
consumption.  Assuming that this is £10, which he
spends with the tailor.  If the £10 represents
revenue for the tailor, he spends it in a similar way; in
turn, he buys bread with it and so on, In this way the money
flows back to the baker, no longer however as a replacement
of revenue, but as a replacement of capital.</p>
<p>A question that can still be raised is: in
M—C—M, as carried through by the capitalist,
when it represents self-expanding value, the capitalist
draws more money out of circulation than he threw into
it.  (This was what the miser actually wanted to do but
did not succeed in doing.  For he does not draw more
value in the form of gold and silver out of circulation than
he threw into it in the form of commodities.  He
possesses more value in the form of money, whereas
previously he had more value in the form of commodities.)
The total production costs of his commodity are
£1,000.  He sells it for £1,200, because
his commodity now contains 20 per cent or one-fifth unpaid
labour—labour that he has not paid for but
nevertheless sold.  How then is it possible for all
capitalists, the class of industrial capitalists,
continually to draw more money out of circulation than they
put into it?  First it can be said that on the other
hand the capitalist continually puts in more than he draws
out.  His fixed capital had to be paid for.  But
he sells it only in the measure that he consumes it, only
bit by bit.  It always enters only to a much smaller
extent into the <i>value</i> of the commodity, while it
enters in its entirety into the process of producing the
commodity.  If its circulation is 10 years, only
one-tenth of it enters annually into the commodity, and no
money circulates in respect of the other nine-tenths, as
this nine-tenths does not in any way come into circulation
in the form of a commodity.  That is the first
point.</p>
<p>We will consider this problem later, and meanwhile return
to Quesnay.</p>
<p>But first one other point.  The return of bank-notes
to a bank which discounts bills or makes advances in notes
is quite a different phenomenon from the return of money
which we have been considering up to now.  In this case
the transformation of the commodity into money is
anticipated.  It receives the form of money before it
is sold, perhaps before it is produced.  Or perhaps it
has already been sold (for bills of exchange).  <i>In
any case</i> it has not yet been <i>paid for</i>, not yet
reconverted into money.  This transformation is
therefore in any case anticipated.  As soon as it is
sold (or <i>deemed</i> to be sold) the money flows back to
the bank, either in its own notes, which thus come back out
of circulation, or in notes of other banks, which are then
exchanged for its own (between the bankers)—so that
then the notes of both are withdrawn from circulation,
return to their starting-point—or in gold and
silver.  If this gold and silver is demanded for
banknotes which are in some third person’s hands, the notes
come back.  If the notes are not converted, a similar
quantity of gold and silver is taken out of circulation, and
now lies in the bank’s reserves instead of the notes.</p>
<p>In all these cases the process is this: the existence of
the money (transformation of the commodity into money) was
anticipated.  As soon as it is actually transformed
into money, the transformation into money takes place a
second time.  This second existence of it as money,
however, returns to the starting-point—it cancels out,
takes the place of its first existence as money, and comes
back out of circulation to the bank.  It is perhaps the
<i>same identical</i> quantity of notes that expressed its
first existence which now expresses its second.  The
bill of exchange for example has been discounted by a yarn
manufacturer.  He has received the bill of exchange
from the weaver.  With the £1,000 he pays for
coal, raw cotton, etc.  The various hands through which
these notes pass in payment for their commodities finally
spend them on linen, and so the notes come to the weaver,
who on the day the bill matures pays the spinner the
identical notes, and the spinner in turn takes them back to
the bank.  It is by no means necessary that the second
(posthumous) transformation of the commodity into
money—after the transformation in anticipation—
<span class="context">||430|</span> should be carried
through in different money from the first.  And so it
seems as if the spinner has in fact got nothing, since he
borrowed notes, and the end of the process is that he gets
them back again and returns them to the issuer.  In
fact however these identical notes have served as means of
circulation and means of payment during this period, and the
spinner has used them in part to pay his debts, and in part
to buy goods needed for the reproduction of the yarn, and in
this way he has realised a surplus (through the exploitation
of his workmen) a part of which he can now pay back to the
bank.  Likewise in money, since more money has flowed
back to him than he had expended, advanced, laid out. 
How?  That again brings us to the question we had
meanwhile held over.</p>
<p><a id="s4"> </a></p>
<h3>[4.  Circulation between Farmer and Manufacturer
According to the Tableau Économique]</h3>
<p>So back to Quesnay.  We come now to the third and
fourth acts of circulation.</p>
<p>L (the landlord) buys manufactured commodities from S
(sterile class, manufacturer) (line a—c in the
Tableau) for 1 milliard.  Here 1 milliard in money, and
commodities to the same amount, circulate.  &lt;Because
what takes place is a single act of exchange.  If L
bought from S in instalments and similarly received his rent
from F (the farmer) in instalments, the 1 milliard of
manufactured commodities could be bought say with 100
millions, For L buys manufactured commodities from S for 100
millions; S buys means of subsistence from F for 100
millions; F pays 100 millions of rent to L; and when this
had occurred ten times, ten times 100 millions of
commodities would have passed from S to L, and from F to S,
and ten times 100 millions from F to L.  The whole
circulation would then have been carried out with 100
millions.  If F however pays the rent in a single
payment, a part of the 1 milliard which is now in the
possession of S and of the 1 milliard which is again in F’s
possession might lie in their money-boxes, and the other
part be in circulation.&gt; Commodities to the value of 1
milliard have now passed from S to L; on the other hand,
money to the value of 1 milliard has passed from L to
S.  This is simple circulation.  Money and
commodities merely change hands in the reverse
direction.  But in addition to the 1 milliard of means
of subsistence which the farmer has sold to L and which have
thus gone into consumption, the 1 milliard of manufactured
commodities which S has sold to L have also gone into
consumption.  It must be noted that these existed
before the new harvest.  (Otherwise L could not buy
them with the product of the new harvest.)</p>
<p>S for his part now buys means of subsistence to the value
of 1 milliard from F [line c–d in the Tableau]. 
Now a <i>second one-fifth of the gross product</i> has
fallen out of circulation and into consumption.  As
between S and F, the 1 milliard functions as means of
circulation.  But at the same time two things take
place in this transaction which do not take place in the
process between S and L.  In that process S reconverted
into money one part of his product—manufactured goods
to the amount of 1 milliard.  But in the exchange with
F he transforms the money again into means of subsistence
(which for Quesnay are equivalent to wages), and in this way
replaces the capital which he had expended in wages and
consumed.  This retransformation of the 1 milliard into
means of subsistence expresses, in the case of L, mere
consumption, but in the case of S it expresses industrial
consumption, reproduction; for he retransforms a part of his
commodity into one of the elements in its
production—means of subsistence.  The one
metamorphosis of the commodity, its retransformation from
money into commodity, thus in this case expresses at the
same time the beginning of its <i>real</i>, not merely
<i>formal</i>, metamorphosis—the beginning of its
reproduction, the beginning of its retransformation into its
own production elements; in this transaction there is at the
same time metamorphosis of the capital.  But for
L.  revenue is merely converted from the form of money
into the form of commodity.  This implies only
consumption.</p>
<p>In the second place, however, since S buys means of
subsistence from F for 1 milliard, the second 1 milliard
which F paid as money-rent to L returns to F.  But it
only returns to him because he draws it back out of
circulation, buys it back, with an equivalent—1
milliard in commodities.  It is the same as if the
landlord had bought from him 1 milliard of means of
subsistence (in addition to the first milliard); that is to
say, as if the landlord had had the second part of his
money-rent delivered by the farmer in commodities, and had
then exchanged these commodities for commodities from
S.  S only lifts for L the second part of the 2
milliards in commodities which F has paid to L in
money.  If payment had been in kind, F would have given
L 2 milliards in means of subsistence; L would have consumed
1 milliard of these himself, and exchanged the other 1
milliard in means of subsistence with S, for the latter’s
manufactured goods.  In this case there would only have
been: (1) transfer of the 2 milliards in means of
subsistence from F to L; (2) a barter transaction between L
and S, in which the former exchanges 1 milliard in means of
subsistence against 1 milliard in manufactured goods, and
vice versa.</p>
<p>But instead of this, four acts have taken place: <span class="context">||431|</span> (1) transfer of 2 milliards in
money from F to L; (2) L buys means of subsistence for 1
milliard from F, the money flows back to F, serving as means
of circulation; (3) L buys manufactured goods from S for 1
milliard in money; the money functions as means of
circulation; changing hands in the reverse direction to the
goods; (4) with the 1 milliard in money, S buys means of
subsistence from F; the money functions as means of
circulation.  For S, it at the same time circulates as
capital.  It flows back to F because now the second 1
milliard in means of subsistence is lifted—for which
the landlord held a note of assignment from him.  The
money however does not come back to him directly from the
landlord, but only after it has served as means of
circulation between L and S, and in between, before it lifts
the 1 milliard of victuals, has on its passage lifted 1
milliard in manufactures, and transferred them from the
manufacturer to the landlord.  The conversion of his
commodity into money (in the exchange with the landlord) as
well as the following conversion of money into victuals (in
the exchange with the farmer) are, on the part of S, the
metamorphosis of his capital, first into the form of money,
and secondly into the form of the constitutive elements
necessary to the reproduction of the capital.</p>
<p>The result of the four acts of circulation up to this
point is therefore: the landlord has spent his revenue, half
on means of subsistence, half on manufactured goods. 
By these transactions, the 2 milliards he received as rent
in the form of money have been spent.  Half of it flows
back to the farmer from him direct, and half indirect, via
S.  S however has parted with one part of his finished
goods, and has replaced this part with means of subsistence,
that is, with an element needed for reproduction.  With
these processes completed, the circulation is at an end as
far as the landlord comes into it.  But the following
have passed out of circulation into consumption—partly
unproductive consumption, partly industrial—(the
landlord has partially replaced the capital of S by spending
his revenue): (1) 1 milliard of means of subsistence
(product of the new harvest); (2) 1 milliard of manufactured
goods (product of the previous year’s harvest); (3) 1
milliard of means of subsistence which enter into
reproduction, that is, into the production of the goods
which S next year will have to exchange against half the
landlord’s rent.</p>
<p>The 2 milliards in money are now again in the hands of
the farmer.  He then buys goods for 1 milliard from S
to replace his annual and original advances, in so far as
these consist partly of tools, etc., and partly of
manufactured goods which he consumes during the process of
production.  This is a simple process of
circulation.  It puts 1 milliard into the hands of S,
while the second part of his product existing in the form of
a commodity is converted into money.  On both sides
there is metamorphosis of capital.  The farmer’s 1
milliard is reconverted into elements of production needed
for reproduction.  The finished goods of S are
reconverted into money; they pass through the <i>formal</i>
metamorphosis from commodity into money, without which the
capital cannot be reconverted into its production elements,
and therefore also cannot be reproduced.  This is the
fifth circulation process.  <i>One milliard of
manufactured goods</i> (product of the previous year’s
harvest) (a'–b') fall out of circulation into
reproductive consumption.</p>
<p>Finally S reconverts the 1 milliard in money, in which
form half of his commodities now exist, into the other half
of his conditions of production—raw materials,
etc.  (a''–b''), This is simple
circulation.  For S, it is at the same time the
metamorphosis of his capital into the form suitable for its
reproduction; for F, it is the reconversion of his product
into money.  Now the last one-fifth of the gross
product falls out of circulation into consumption.</p>
<p>That is to say: one-fifth goes into reproduction for the
farmer, and does not come into circulation; the landlord
consumes one-fifth (that makes two-fifths); S gets
two-fifths; in all, four-fifths.</p>
<p>Here there is an obvious gap in the explanation. 
Quesnay seems to reckon like this: F gives L (line
a–b) 1 milliard (one-fifth) in means of
subsistence.  With 1 milliard of his raw materials be
replaces S’s fund (a”–b”).  And 1
milliard in means of subsistence form wages for S, which he
adds as value to the commodities and consumes in food while
he is doing it (c–d), And 1 milliard remains in
reproduction (a'), not entering into circulation. 
Finally, 1 milliard of the product replaces advances
(a'–b').  Only he overlooks the fact that S buys
for the 1 milliard in manufactured goods, neither means of
subsistence nor raw materials from the farmer, but pays back
to him his own money.  In fact he sets out from the
presupposition that the farmer possesses 2 milliards in
money in addition to his gross product, and that this money
is the total fund from which the money in circulation is
provided.</p>
<p>He also forgets that in addition to the 5 milliards in
gross product, a further 2 milliards of gross product exist
in manufactured commodities produced before the new
harvest.  For the 5 milliards represent only the total
annual production, <span class="context">||432|</span> the
total crop produced by the farmers, but not the gross
product of manufacture, the reproductive elements for which
have to be replaced out of this year’s harvest.</p>
<p>We thus have: (1) 2 milliards in money in the farmer’s
hands; (2) 5 milliards in gross product of the land; (3) 2
milliards in manufactured goods.  That is, 2 milliards
in money, and 7 milliards in product (agricultural and
industrial), The circulation process, put briefly, is as
follows (F=farmer, L=landlord, S = manufacturer,
sterile):</p>
<p>F pays L 2 milliards in money for rent; L buys from F
means of subsistence for 1 milliard.  So one-fifth of
the farmer’s gross product is disposed of.  At the same
time, 1 milliard in money flows back to him.  L
moreover buys goods from S for 1 milliard.  By this
transaction, one-half of S’s gross product is disposed
of.  In return for it, he has 1 milliard in
money.  With this money he buys 1 milliard of means of
subsistence from F.  By this transaction he replaces
one-half of the reproductive elements of his capital. 
This disposes of another one-fifth of the farmer’s gross
product.  At the same time the farmer finds himself
again in possession of the 2 milliards in money, the price
of the 2 milliards in means of subsistence which he has sold
to L and S.  F now buys goods from S for 1 milliard,
which replace for him half of his advances.  So the
other half of the manufacturer’s gross product is disposed
of.  Finally, the latter, S, buys raw materials from
the farmer for the last 1 milliard in money; thereby a third
one-fifth of the farmer’s gross product is disposed of, and
the second half of the reproductive elements of the capital
of S is replaced; but also 1 milliard flows back to the
farmer.  The latter finds himself therefore again in
possession of the 2 milliards, which is in order, since
Quesnay thinks of him as the capitalist, in relation to whom
L is merely a receiver of revenue and S merely a
wage-earner.  If he paid L and S directly in his
product, he would not part with any money.  If he pays
out in money, they buy his product with it, and the money
flows back to him.  This is the formal return circuit
of money to the industrial capitalist, who as buyer opens
the whole business and brings it to an end.  Moreover,
one-fifth of the advances belongs to reproduction. 
One-fifth of the means of subsistence, however, which has
not entered into circulation at all, remains to be disposed
of.</p>

<h3>[5.  Circulation of Commodities and Circulation of Money
in the Tableau Économique.  Different Cases in
Which the Money Flows Back to Its Starting-Point]</h3>
<p>S buys from the farmer means of subsistence for 1
milliard and raw materials for 1 milliard; and on the other
hand F buys from him only 1 milliard of commodities to
replace his advances.  So S has to pay a balance of 1
milliard which in the final instance he pays with the 1
milliard he has received from L.  Quesnay seems to
confuse this <i>payment</i> of 1 milliard to F with the
<i>purchase of</i> F’s product to the amount of 1
milliard.  Reference must be made to the Abbé
Baudeau’s explanations on this point.</p>
<p>In fact (on our calculation) the 2 milliards have only
served to: (1) pay rent to the amount of 2 milliards in
money; (2) circulate 3 milliards of the farmer’s gross
product (1 milliard means of subsistence to L, 2 milliards
means of subsistence and raw materials to S) and to
circulate 2 milliards of the gross product of S (1 milliard
of it to L, who consumes it, and 1 milliard to F, who
consumes it reproductively).</p>
<p>In the last purchase (a''–b'') in which S
buys raw materials from F, he pays him back in money.</p>
<p><span class="context">||433|</span> So once more:</p>
<p>S has received from L 1 milliard in money.  With
this 1 milliard in money he buys means of subsistence from F
to that amount.  With the same 1 milliard in money F
buys commodities from S.  With the same 1 milliard in
money S buys raw products from F.</p>
<p>Or, S buys from F raw materials for 1 milliard in money,
and means of subsistence for 1 milliard in money.  F
buys goods from S for 1 milliard [in money].  In this
case 1 milliard flows back to S, but only because it was
assumed that in addition to the 1 milliard in money he
receives from the landlord, and the 1 milliard in goods that
he still has to sell, he had over and above this another 1
milliard in money which he himself had thrown into
circulation.  Instead of 1 milliard circulating the
goods between him and the farmer, on this assumption 2
milliards would have been used for it.  Then 1 milliard
returns to S.  For he makes purchases from the farmer
for 2 milliards in money.  The latter buys 1 milliard
from him, for which he pays him back half the money he had
received from him.</p>
<p>In the first case S buys in two stages.  First he
pays out 1 milliard; this flows back to him from F; and then
he pays it out once more definitively to F, and so nothing
comes back.</p>
<p>In the second case, on the other hand, S makes a single
purchase for 2 milliards, If then F makes a return purchase
for 1 milliard, this remains with S.  The circulation
would have used 2 milliards instead of 1 milliard, because
in the first case the 1 mil1iard, by rotating twice,
realised 2 milliards in commodities.  In the second
case 2 milliards, in one rotation, also [realised] 2
milliards in commodities.  If the farmer now pays back
1 milliard to S, S has not got more than in the first
case.  For he has thrown into circulation, in addition
to 1 milliard in commodities, also 1 milliard in money from
his own fund which existed prior to the circulation
process.  He has put it out into circulation, and so it
flows back to him.</p>
<p>In the first case: S [buys] 1 milliard of commodities
from F, for 1 milliard in money; F [buys] 1 milliard in
goods from S, [for] 1 milliard in money; S [buys] 1 milliard
of commodities from F, [for] 1 milliard in money; so that F
keeps 1 milliard.</p>
<p>In the second case: S [buys] 2 milliards of commodities
from F, for 2 milliards in money; F [buys] 1 milliard of
goods from S, for 1 milliard in money.  The farmer, as
before, keeps the 1 milliard.  S however gets back the
1 milliard of capital advanced by him to circulation, it is
thrown back to him by circulation.  S buys commodities
from F for 2 milliards; F buys goods from S for 1
milliard.  Therefore in any event S has to pay a
balance of 1 milliard, but not more than this.  Since,
by way of paying this balance, he had paid F 2 milliards as
a result of the particular form of circulation, F pays him
back this 1 milliard, while in the first case he does not
return any money to him.</p>
<p>In the first case S makes purchases from F for 2
milliards, and F from S for 1 milliard.  So in both
cases the balance in F’s favour is 1 milliard.  But
this balance is paid to him in such a way that his own money
flows back to him, because S first buys 1 milliard from F,
then F 1 milliard from S, and finally S 1 milliard from
F.  In these transactions 1 milliard has circulated 3
milliards.  But in the aggregate the value in
circulation (if the money is real money) has been 4
milliards, 3 milliards in commodities and 1 milliard in
money.  The amount of money originally thrown into
circulation (to pay F) and circulating was never more than 1
milliard—that is, never more than the balance which S
had to pay to F.  Because F bought from him to the
amount of 1 milliard before he buys from F to the amount of
1 milliard for the second time, S can pay his balance with
this 1 milliard.</p>
<p>In the second case S throws 2 milliards into
circulation.  It is true that with it he buys 2
milliards in commodities from F.  These 2 milliards are
here required as means of circulation, and are paid out
against an equivalent in commodities.  But F buys back
goods for 1 milliard from S.  One milliard therefore
returns to S, as the balance which he has to pay to F is
only 1 milliard and not 2 milliards.  He has now
replaced for F 1 milliard in commodities, and so F must pay
him back the 1 milliard, which <i>now</i> he would have paid
him in money for nothing.  This case is remarkable
enough to spend a moment on it.</p>
<p>There are various possible cases of the circulation
assumed above of 3 milliards in commodities, of which 2
milliards are means of subsistence and 1 milliard
manufactures; we must however note: <i>first</i> that on
Quesnay’s assumption there is 1 milliard in money in the
hands of S and 1 milliard of money in the hands of F at the
moment when the circulation between the two of them begins;
<i>secondly</i>, we will assume by way of illustrating the
point that in addition to the 1 milliard which S receives
from L, S has in his till another 1 milliard in money.</p>
<p><span class="context">||434|</span> I. 
<i>First:</i> The case as Quesnay puts it.  S buys 1
milliard in commodities from F, for 1 milliard in money;
with the 1 milliard in money thus received from S, F buys 1
milliard in commodities from S; finally S, with the 1
milliard in money he has got back in this way, buys 1
milliard of commodities from F.  F is therefore left
with the 1 milliard in money which to him represents capital
(in fact, along with the other 1 milliard in money which he
has got back from L, it forms the revenue with which again
next year he pays the rent in money; that is, 2 milliards in
money).  1 milliard in money has here circulated three
times— from S to F, from F to S, from S to F—and
each time in exchange for 1 milliard in commodities, that
is, for 3 milliards in all.  If the money itself has
value, values to a total of 4 milliards are in
circulation.  Money here functions only as means of
circulation; but for F, in whose hands it finally remains,
it is transformed into money and possibly into capital.</p>
<p>II.  <i>Secondly:</i> The money functions merely as
means of payment.  In this case S, who buys 2 milliards
in commodities from F, and F, who buys 1 milliard in
commodities from S, settle accounts with each other. 
At the close of the transaction S has to pay a balance of 1
milliard in money.  As in the former case, 1 milliard
in money comes into F’s money-box, but without having served
as means of circulation.  The money is a transfer of
capital for him, as it only replaces his capital of 1
milliard in commodities.  As before, values amounting
to 4 milliards are in circulation.  But instead of
three movements of 1 milliard in money, there has only been
one, and the money has only paid for an amount of values in
commodity form that is equal to itself.  In the former
case, it paid for three times as much.  What would be
saved as compared with case I would be the two superfluous
movements of circulation.</p>
<p>III.  <i>Thirdly:</i> To start with F comes forward
as the buyer with the 1 milliard in money (which he has had
from L), and buys commodities from S for 1 milliard. 
Instead of lying fallow with him as a hoard for payment of
the next rent, now the 1 milliard circulates.  S has
now 2 milliards in money (1 milliard from L and 1 milliard
from F).  With these 2 milliards in money he buys
commodities to the amount of 2 milliards from F.  Now
values to the amount of 5 milliards have been in circulation
(3 milliards in commodities, 2 milliards in money). 
There has been a circulation of 1 milliard in money and 1
milliard in commodities, and a circulation of 2 milliards in
money and 2 milliards in commodities.  Of these 2
milliards in money, the milliard originating with the farmer
circulates twice, the milliard originating with 5 only
once.  Now 2 milliards in money return to F, of which
however only 1 milliard settles his balance; the other 1
milliard in money, which he himself had thrown into
circulation because he took the initiative as buyer, flows
back to him through circulation.</p>
<p>IV.  <i>Fourthly:</i> S buys at once 2 milliards in
commodities from F, with 2 milliards in money (1 milliard
from L, and 1 milliard which he puts himself into
circulation from his till).  F buys back from S 1
milliard in commodities, thus returning to him 1 milliard in
money; and F holds, as before, 1 milliard in money to settle
the balance between him and S.  Values to the amount of
5 milliards have circulated.  There are two acts of
circulation.</p>
<p>Of the 2 milliards in money which S returns to F, 1
milliard represents the money which F himself threw into
circulation, and only 1 milliard the money which S threw
into circulation.  Here 2 milliards in money instead of
1 milliard in money come back to F, but in fact he gets only
1 milliard, as he himself had thrown the other 1 milliard
into circulation.  That is, in case III.  In case
IV 1 milliard in money returns to S, but it is the 1
milliard which he got from his money-box, not from selling
his commodities to L, and himself threw into
circulation.</p>
<p>In case I and indeed in case II there is never more than
1 milliard in money circulating; but in case I it circulates
three times and in case II it only once changes hands; this
is merely due to the fact that in case II a high development
of credit, and consequently economy in payments, is assumed;
while in case I the movement is rapid; however, each time
the money functions as means of circulation, and therefore
the value at the two poles must each time appear twice, once
in money and once in commodity.  In case III and IV 2
milliards circulate, instead of 1 milliard as in I and
II.  This is because on one occasion in both cases (in
case III by S as buyer who closes the circulation process,
in case IV by S as buyer who opens the circulation process)
commodity values to the amount of 2 milliards are at a
single stroke thrown into circulation; that is, 2 milliards
of commodities enter into circulation in a single act; it is
assumed, moreover, that the commodities have to be paid for
on the spot and not after the balance has been struck.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing about the movement is however
the 1 milliard in money which in case III is left in the
hands of the farmer, in case IV in the hands of the
manufacturer, although in both cases the balance of 1
milliard is paid to the farmer, and he gets not a farthing
more in case III, and not a farthing less in case IV. 
In these transactions, of course, the exchange is always an
exchange of equivalents, and when we speak of a balance we
mean only the equivalent value which is paid for in money
instead of in commodities.</p>
<p>In case III F throws 1 milliard in money into
circulation, and gets in exchange for it from S the
equivalent in commodities, or 1 milliard in
commodities.  But then S buys commodities from him for
2 milliards in money.  The first 1 milliard in money
which he threw in thus comes back to him, because 1 milliard
in commodities has been taken from him in exchange. 
This 1 milliard in commodities is paid for with the money
which be had paid out.  He gets the second 1 milliard
in money in payment for the second 1 milliard in
commodities.  This balance is owed to him in money,
because he had only bought in all 1 milliard of commodities,
and commodities to the value of 2 milliards had been bought
from him.</p>
<p><span class="context">||435|</span> In case IV S throws 2
milliards in money into circulation at once, for which he
takes from F commodities for 2 milliards.  With the
money which S himself had paid him, F in turn buys from S
 commodities for 1 milliard and so the 1 milliard in
money returns to S.</p>
<p>In case IV: S in fact gives F 1 milliard in commodities
(the equivalent for 1 milliard in money) and 2 milliards in
money, that is, 3 milliards; but S gets from F only 2
milliards in commodities.  F has consequently to return
to him 1 milliard in money.</p>
<p>In case III: F gives S in commodities the equivalent of 2
milliards in money, and 1 milliard in money.  That is,
3 milliards in money.  But he gets from S only 1
milliard in commodities, the equivalent of 1 milliard in
money.  S has consequently to return to him 2 milliards
in money; he pays back 1 milliard in the money which F
himself threw into circulation, and he himself throws 1
milliard into circulation.  He keeps the balance of 1
milliard in money, but cannot keep 2 milliards in money.</p>
<p>In both cases S receives 2 milliards in commodities, and
F 1 milliard in commodities plus 1 milliard in money, that
is to say, the balance in money.  In case III, in
addition to this, another 1 milliard comes to F, but this is
only the excess of the money which he has thrown into
circulation over what he has drawn from circulation in
commodities.  Similarly with S in case IV.</p>
<p>In both cases S has to pay a balance of 1 milliard in
money, because he takes commodities to the value of 2
milliards out of circulation, and puts into it commodities
only to the value of l milliard.  In both cases F has
to receive a balance of 1 milliard in money, because he has
thrown 2 milliards in commodities into circulation and only
drawn from it 1 milliard in commodities; the second 1
milliard must therefore be paid in money to him.  In
both cases, it is only this 1 milliard in money that can
finally change hands.  Since however 2 milliards are
actually in circulation, this must flow back to the person
who put it into circulation; and this holds good whether F,
in addition to receiving a balance of 1 milliard out of
circulation, has thrown into it another 1 milliard in money;
or whether S, who has to pay only a balance of 1 milliard in
money, has in addition advanced another 1 milliard in
money.</p>
<p>In case III 1 milliard in money comes into circulation in
excess of the quantity of money that would under different
circumstances be needed for the circulation of this quantity
of commodities, because F comes forward as the first buyer,
and must therefore throw money into circulation, whatever
his ultimate position may be.  In case IV, in the same
way, 2 milliards in money come into circulation, instead of
only 1 milliard as in II, because first S comes forward as
buyer at the outset, and secondly buys 2 milliards all at
once.  In both cases the money that <i>circulates</i>
between these buyers and sellers can finally only be equal
to the balance which one of them has to pay.  For the
money which S or F has expended in excess of this amount is
paid back to him.</p>
<p>Let us assume that F buys commodities from S to the value
of 2 milliards.  This case, then, would look like this:
F gives S 1 milliard in money for commodities.  S buys
commodities from F to the value of 2 milliards in money, as
a result of which the first 1 milliard returns to F and l
milliard into the bargain.  F in turn buys commodities
from S for 1 milliard in money, which brings this money back
to S.  At the end of the process F would have
commodities to the amount of 2 milliards and the 1 milliard
that he had originally, before the circulation process
began; and S commodities for 2 milliards and 1 milliard in
money which he too originally had.  The 1 milliard in
money of F, and the 1 milliard in money of S, would have
played their role only as means of circulation and then
would have flowed back—as money or in this case also
as capital—to both the persons who had advanced
them.  Had they both used money as means of payment,
they would have set off 2 milliards in commodities against 2
milliards in commodities; their accounts would have
cancelled out and not a farthing would have circulated
between them.</p>
<p>Thus the money which circulates as means of circulation
between two persons who confront each other mutually as
buyers and sellers returns to its source; there are three
cases in which it can circulate.</p>
<p>[<i>First:</i>] The commodity values supplied balance
each other.  In this case the money returns to the
person who advanced it to irculation and in this way used
his capital to meet the costs of circulation.  For
example, if F and S each buys commodities for 2 milliards
from the other, and S opens the dance, he buys commodities
from F for 2 milliards in money.  F returns to him the
2 milliards in money, buying with it 2 milliards in
commodities from him.  Thus S has both before and after
the transaction 2 milliards in commodities and 2 milliards
in money.  Or when, as in the case cited previously,
both advance the means of circulation to an equal amount,
each gets back what he had advanced to circulation—as
above, 1 milliard in money to F and 1 milliard to S.</p>
<p><i>Secondly:</i> The commodity values exchanged between
the two parties do not cancel each other out.  There is
a balance to be paid in money.  If, as above in case I,
the circulation of the commodities has taken place in such a
way that no more money has entered <i>into circulation</i>
than is required for the payment of this balance— it
being always only this sum that passes to and fro between
the two parties—then it comes finally into the hands
of the last seller, in whose favour the balance is.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly:</i> The commodity values exchanged between
the two parties are not equal to each other; there is a
balance to be paid; but the circulation of the commodities
takes place in such a form that more money circulates than
is required to settle the balance; in this case the money in
excess of this balance returns to the party who has advanced
it.  In case III to the man who receives the balance,
in case IV to the one who has to pay it.</p>
<p>In the second category listed above the money only
<i>returns</i> when the receiver of the balance is the first
buyer, as for example between worker and capitalist. 
It changes hands, as [in case] II, when the other party
comes forward as the first buyer.</p>
<p><span class="context">||436|</span> &lt;Of course, all
this only takes place on the assumption that the definite
quantity of commodities is bought and sold between the same
persons, so that each of them is alternately buyer and
seller in relation to the other one, On the other hand let
us assume that the 3 milliards of commodities are equally
distributed among the commodity owners.  A, A',
A'', the sellers, and they are confronted by the buyers
B, B', B''.  If the three purchases take place
simultaneously, that is to say, alongside each other, 3
thousand in money must circulate, so that each A is in
possession of 1 thousand in money and each B is in
possession of 1 thousand in commodities.  If the
purchases follow each other, succeeding each other in time,
the circulation of the same 1 thousand in money can only
effect these if the metamorphoses of the commodities are
interwoven, that is to say, when some persons function as
buyers and sellers, even if not [in relation] to the same
persons as in the case above, but as buyer in relation to
one person, and as seller in relation to the other. 
Thus for example: (1) A sells to B for 1 thousand in money;
(2) A buys with this 1 thousand from B'; (3) B' with the 1
thousand in money buys from A'; (4) A' with the 1 thousand
in money from B''; (5) B'' with the 1 thousand in
money from A''.  The money would have changed
hands five times between the six persons; but also
commodities to the value of 5 thousand would have
circulated.  If commodities for 3 thousand are to be
circulated, it would be like this: (1) A [buys] from B for 1
thousand in money; (2) B from A' for 1 thousand in money;
(3) A' from B' for 1 thousand in money.  Three changes
of place as between four persons.  It is
M—C.&gt;</p>
<p>The cases set out above do not contradict the law
explained earlier: “that with a given rapidity of
circulation of money and a given total sum of prices of
commodities the quantity of the circulating medium is
determined” (I, p. 85).  In example 1 above, 1
thousand in money circulates three times, and in fact it
circulates commodities to the amount of 3 thousand. 
The amount of money in circulation is consequently
<sup class="ratio">3,000 (sum of prices)</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3 (velocity)</sub> or
<sup class="ratio">3,000 (sum of prices)</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3 cycles</sub>
= 1,000 money.</p>
<p>In case III or IV the total prices of the commodities in
circulation are, it is true, equal to 3,000 in money; but
the rapidity of circulation is different.  2,000 in
money circulates once, that is, 1,000 in money plus 1,000 in
money.  Of the 2,000, however, 1,000 circulates once
more.  2,000 in money circulates two-thirds of the
3,000 in commodities, and half of it, 1,000 in money,
circulates another third; one 1,000 in money circulates
twice, but another 1 000 in money circulates only
once.  The twofold circulation of 1,000 in money
realises commodities whose prices are equal to 2,000 in
money; and the single circulation of 1,000 in money realises
commodities whose prices are equal to 1,000 in
money—both together, equal to 3,000 in
commodities.  What then is the rapidity of circulation
of the money in relation to the commodities which it
circulates in this case?  The 2,000 in money makes 1
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">2</sub> cycles (this is the same thing as
<i>first</i> the total
sum circulates once, and then half of it again completes
one cycle), that is, <sup class="ratio">3</sup>/<sub class="ratio">2</sub>.  And in
fact:</p>
<p><sup class="ratio">3,000 (sum of prices)</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3/2 cycles</sub>
= 2,000 in money.</p>
<p>What is it then that determines the <i>different
rapidity</i> of circulation of the money in this case?</p>
<p>Both in III and IV the difference arises from the fact
that, in contrast to I —where the total amount of
prices of the commodities circulating each time is never
greater and never smaller than <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> of
the total prices of the aggregate quantity of commodities
which circulate, commodities only to the amount of 1,000 in
money circulate at any time—in III and IV, however,
commodities for 2,000 circulate once, and commodities for
1,000 circulate once, that is, once two-thirds of the
existing quantity of commodities, and once one-third. 
For the same reason, larger varieties of coin must circulate
in wholesale trade than in retail trade.</p>
<p>As I have already observed (I, “[The] Circulation
of Money”), the reflux of the money shows in
the first place that the <i>buyer has in turn become
seller</i>; and in fact it makes no difference whether in so
doing he sells to the same person from whom he has bought,
or not.  If however the buying and selling is between
the same persons, then the phenomena appear which have been
the occasion of so many errors (Destutt de Tracy).  The
buyer becoming seller shows that new commodities are to be
sold.  Continuity in the circulation of commodities
—tantamount to its constant renewal (I,
p. 78)—is, therefore, reproduction.  The buyer
can become in turn seller—as in the case of the
manufacturer in relation to the labourer—without this
denoting an act of reproduction.  It is only the
continuity, the repetition of this reflux, in relation to
which it can be said that it denotes reproduction.</p>
<p>The reflux of money, when it represents the reconversion
of the capital into its money form, necessarily shows the
end of one cycle [i.e., turnover] and the beginning again of
new reproduction, if the capital as such continues the
process.  In this case too he [the capitalist], as in
all other cases, was the seller, C—M, and then became
buyer, M—C; but it is only in M that his capital again
possesses the form in which it can be exchanged for its
reproductive elements, and here the C represents these
reproductive elements.  M—C here represents the
transformation of the money-capital into productive or
industrial capital.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as we have seen, the reflux of the money to
its starting-point may show that the money balance in a
series of purchases and sales is in favour of the buyer with
whom the series of these processes opened.  F buys from
S for 1,000 in money.  S buys from F 2,000 in
money.  Here the 1,000 in money flows back to F. 
As for the other 1,000, there is merely a change of place of
the money between S and F.</p>
<p><span class="context">||437|</span> Finally, however, a
reflux of the money to its starting-point may take place
without indicating payment of a balance, both (1) when the
reciprocal payments cancel each other out, and consequently
there is no balance to be paid in money; and (2) when the
transactions do <i>not</i> cancel out, and therefore a
balance has to be paid.  See the cases analysed
above.  In all these cases it makes no difference
whether for example the same S confronts F; S representing
here in relation to F and F to S the total number of those
selling to him and buying from him (exactly as in the
example where payment of a balance is indicated by the
reflux of the money).  In all these cases the money
flows back to the person who so to speak has advanced it to
circulation.  It has done its job in circulation, like
bank-notes, and comes back to the person who laid it
out.  <i>Here it is only means of circulation. 
The final capitalists settle with each other, and so it
comes back to the one who paid it out</i>.</p>
<p>We have therefore still to deal later on with the
question we have held over; the capitalist draws more money
out of circulation than he threw into it.</p>

<h3>[6.  Significance of the Tableau Économique
in the History of Political Economy]</h3>
<p>Back to Quesnay:</p>
<p>Adam Smith cites with some irony the Marquis de
Mirabeau’s hyperbolical statement:</p>
<p class="quote">“There have been since the world
began three great inventions… The first is the
invention of <i>writing…</i>.The second is <i>the
invention</i> (!)  of <i>money…</i>.  ‘The
third is the <i>economical table</i>, the result of the
other two, which completes them both” ( [Smith,
<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, O.U.P. edition, Vol. II, p. .300],
Garnier, t. III, l. IV, ch.  IX, p. 540).</p>
<p>But in fact it was an attempt to portray the whole
production process of capital as a <i>process of
reproduction</i>, with circulation merely as the form of
this reproductive process; and the circulation of money only
as a phase in the circulation of capital; at the same time
to include in this reproductive process the origin of
revenue, the exchange between capital and revenue, the
relation between reproductive consumption and final
consumption; and to include in the circulation of capital
the circulation between consumers and producers (in fact
between capital and revenue); and finally to present the
circulation between the two great divisions of productive
labour—raw material production and
manufacture—as phases of this reproductive process;
and all this depicted in a <i>Tableau</i> which in fact
consists of no more than five lines which link together six
points of departure or return— [and this was] in the
second third of the eighteenth century, the period when
political economy was in its infancy—this was an
extremely brilliant conception, incontestably the most
brilliant for which political economy had up to then been
responsible.</p>
<p>As regards the circulation of capital—its
reproductive process, the various forms which it assumes in
this process of reproduction, the connection between the
circulation of capital and circulation in general (that is,
not only the exchange of capital for capital, but of capital
for revenue)—Adam Smith in fact only took over the
inheritance of the Physiocrats and classified and specified
more precisely the separate items in the inventory. 
But his exposition and interpretation of the movement as a
whole was hardly as correct as its presentation in outline
in the Tableau économique, in spite of Quesnay’s
false assumptions.</p>
<p>When moreover Adam Smith says of the Physiocrats:
“Their works have certainly been of some service to
their country” ([<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, O.U.P.
edition, Vol. II, p. 2991, [Garnier], l.c., p. 538), this
is an immoderately moderate statement of the significance
for example of Turgot, one of the immediate fathers of the
French revolution.  <span class="context">|437||</span></p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" id="_ftn1">*</a> <span class="context">||437|</span> The passage from Proudhon
referred to earlier runs: “The amount of mortgage
debts, according to the best-informed writers, is 12
milliards; some put it as high as 16 milliards.  The
amount of debts on note of hand, at least 6. 
Limited-liability companies, about 2.  The public debt,
8 milliards.  Total: 28 milliards.  All these
debts—note this point—have their source in money
lent, or deemed to be lent, at 4, at 5, at 6, at 8, at 12,
and up to 15 per cent.  I take 6 per cent as the
average interest, as far as concerns the first three
categories: that would be, then, on 20 milliards, 1,200
millions.  Add the interest on the public debt, about
400 millions: in all, 1,600 millions annual interest, for a
capital of 1 milliard” (p. 152).  That is to say;
160 per cent.  For “the amount of ready money, I
will not say existing, but circulating in France, including
the cash balance of the Bank, does not exceed 1 milliard,
according to the most usual estimate” (p. 151). 
“When the exchange has been completed, the money is
once more available, and can therefore give rise to a new
loan…The money-capital, going from exchange to
exchange, always returns to its source, and it follows that
it can always be reloaned by the same hand and always
profits the same person” (pp. 153-54).

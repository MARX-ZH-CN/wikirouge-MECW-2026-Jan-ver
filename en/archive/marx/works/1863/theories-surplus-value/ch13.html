Ricardo’s Theory of Rent (Conclusion)</h1>
<p><a id="s1"> </a></p>
<h3>[1.  Ricardo’s Assumption of the Non-Existence of
Landed Property.  Transition to New Land Is Contingent
on Its Situation and Fertility]</h3>
<p>Back to <i>Ricardo</i>, Chapter II “<i>On
Rent”:</i></p>
<p>He begins by presenting the “colonial
theory”, already known from Smith, and here it is
sufficient to state briefly the logical sequence of
ideas.</p>
<p>“On the <i>first settling of a country</i>, in
which there is an <i>abundance</i> of rich and fertile land,
a <i>very small proportion of which is required to be
cultivated for the support of the actual</i> population, or
indeed <i>can be cultivated with the capital</i> which the
population can command, there will be <i>no rent;</i> for no
one would <i>pay</i> for the <i>use</i> of <i>land</i>, when
there <i>was an abundant quantity not yet appropriated</i>,
and, <i>therefore</i>,” (because <i>not
appropriated</i>, which Ricardo entirely forgets later on),
“at the <i>disposal of whosoever might choose</i> to
cultivate it.” ([David Ricardo, <i>On the Principles
of Political Economy, and Taxation</i>, third edition,
London, 1821], p. 55.)</p>
<p>&lt;Here the assumption therefore is: no landed
property.  Although this description of the process is
<i>approximately</i> correct for the settlings of modern
peoples, it is, firstly, inapplicable to developed
capitalist production; and [secondly] equally false
<i>if</i> put forward as the <i>historical</i> course of
events in the old Europe.&gt;</p>
<p class="quote">“On the common principles of supply
and demand, <i>no rent could be paid for such land</i>, for
the reason stated why nothing is given for the use of air
and water, or for any other of the <i>gifts</i> of nature
which exist in <i>boundless quantity</i> … no charge
is made <i>for</i> the use of these <span class="context">||601|</span> natural aids, because they are
inexhaustible, and at every man’s disposal…  If
all land had <i>the same</i> properties, if it were
<i>unlimited in quantity</i>, and <i>uniform in quality</i>,
no charge could be made for its use” (because it could
<i>not</i> be converted <i>into private property at</i>
all), “unless where it possessed <i>peculiar
advantages of situation</i>” (and, he should add, were
at the disposal of a proprietor).  “It is only,
then, because land is <i>not unlimited</i> in
<i>quantity</i> and uniform in quality, and because in the
progress of population, land of an <i>inferior quality</i>,
or <i>less advantageously situated</i>, is called into
cultivation, that <i>rent is ever paid for the use of</i>
it.  When in the progress of society, land of the
second degree of fertility is taken into cultivation,
<i>rent immediately commences on that of the first
quality</i>, and the amount of that <i>rent will depend on
the difference in the quality of these two portions of
land</i>” (l.c., pp.  56-57).</p>
<p>We shall examine this point more closely.  The
logical sequence is this:</p>
<p>If land, rich and fertile land exists in elemental
abundance in practically unlimited quantity compared to the
actual population and capital—and Ricardo
<i>assumes</i> this on the “<i>first settling</i> of a
<i>country” (Smith’s</i> colonial theory)—and
if, furthermore, an “abundant quantity” of this
land is “<i>not yet appropriated</i>” and
<i>therefore</i>, because it is “<i>not yet
appropriated</i>”, is “<i>at the disposal of
whosoever might choose to cultivate it</i>” , in this
case, naturally, nothing is paid for the use of land, [there
is] no rent.  If land were [available] “in
unlimited quantity”—not only relatively to
capital and population, but if it were <i>in fact</i> an
unlimited element (unlimited like air and water) —then
indeed its appropriation by one person could not exclude its
appropriation by another.  No private (also no
“public” or state) property in land could
exist.  In this case—if all land is of <i>the
same</i> quality—no rent could be paid for it at
all.  At most, [rent would be paid] to the possessor of
land which “possessed peculiar advantages of
situation.</p>
<p>Thus, under the circumstances assumed by
Ricardo—namely, that land is “<i>not
appropriated</i>” and uncultivated land is
“<i>therefore</i> at the disposal of whosoever might
choose to cultivate it”— if rent is paid, then
this is only possible because “land is not unlimited
in quantity and uniform in quality”, in other words,
because different types of land exist and land of the same
type is “limited”.  We say that, on
Ricardo’s assumption, only a differential rent can be
paid.  But instead of confining it to this, he jumps at
once to the conclusion that—quite apart from his
assumption of the <i>non-existence of landed</i>
property—absolute rent is never paid for the use of
land, only differential rent.</p>
<p>The whole point therefore is: If land confronts capital
in <i>elemental</i> abundance, then capital operates in
agriculture in <i>the same</i> way as in every other branch
of industry.  There is then no <i>landed property</i>,
no rent.  At most, where one piece of land is more
fertile than another, there can be excess profits as in
industry.  In this case these will consolidate
themselves as differential rent, because of their natural
basis in the different degrees of fertility of the soil.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, land is 1. limited,
2. appropriated, and capital finds <i>landed</i> property as
a precondition—and this is the case where capitalist
production develops: where capital does not find this
precondition, as it does in the old Europe, it creates it
itself, as in the United States—thus land is from the
outset not an elementary field of action for capital. 
Hence [there is absolute] rent, in addition to differential
rent.  But in this case also the transitions from one
type of land to another—be it ascending: I, II, III,
IV or descending IV, III, II, I—work out differently
than they did under <i>Ricardo’s assumption</i>.  For
the employment of capital meets with the resistance of
landed property both in category I and in II, III, IV; and
similarly, in the reverse process, when the transition is
from IV to III etc.  In the transition from IV to III
etc., it is not sufficient for the price of IV to rise high
enough to enable the capital to be employed in III with an
average profit.  The price must rise to such an extent
that rent can be paid on III.  If the transition is
made from I to II etc., then it is self-evident that the
price which paid a rent for I, must not only pay this rent
for II, but a differential rent besides.  By
postulating the <i>non-existence of landed property</i>,
Ricardo has not, of course, eliminated the law that arises
<i>with</i> the <i>existence</i> and <i>from the existence
of landed property</i>.</p>
<p>Having just shown how, <i>on his assumption</i>, a
differential rent can come into being, Ricardo
continues;</p>
<p class="quote">“When land of the third quality is
taken into cultivation, rent immediately commences on the
second, and it is regulated, as before, by the difference in
their productive powers.  At the same time, the rent of
the first quality will rise, for that must always be above
the rent of the second, by the difference between the
produce which they yield with a given quantity of capital
and labour.  With every <i>step in the progress of
population, which shall oblige a country to have recourse to
land of a worse quality</i>” (l.c., p. 57)</p>
<p>(which, however, by no means implies <i>that every step
in the progress of population will oblige a country to have
recourse to land of worse quality</i>),</p>
<p class="quote">“to enable it to raise its supply
<span class="context">||602|</span> of food, rent, on all
the more fertile land, will rise” (l.c., p. 57).</p>
<p>This is all right.</p>
<p>Ricardo now passes on to [an] example.  But, quite
apart from other points to be noted later, this example
presupposes the <i>descending line</i>.  This, however,
is mere <i>presupposition</i>.  In order to smuggle it
in, he says:</p>
<p class="quote">“On the first settling of a country,
in which there is <i>an abundance of rich and fertile</i>
land<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[a]</a> …
<i>not yet appropriated</i>” (l.c., p. 55).</p>
<p>But the case would [be] the same, if, relatively to the
colonists, there was “an abundance of poor and sterile
land—not yet appropriated”.  The
non-payment of <i>rents</i> does not depend on the richness
or fertility of the land, but on the fact that it is
unlimited, unappropriated and of uniform quality, whatever
might be <i>that</i> quality as regards the degree of its
fertility.  Hence Ricardo himself goes on to formulate
his <i>assumption</i> thus :</p>
<p class="quote">“If <i>all land</i> had <i>the
same</i> properties, if it were <i>unlimited in
quantity</i>, and <i>uniform in quality</i>, no charge could
be made for its use” (l.c., p. 56).</p>
<p>He does not say and cannot say, if it “<i>were rich
and fertile</i>”, because this condition would have
<i>absolutely nothing</i> to do with the law.  If,
instead of being rich and fertile, the land were poor and
sterile, then each colonist would have to cultivate a
greater proportion of the whole land, and thus, even where
the land is unappropriated, they would, with the growth of
population, more rapidly approach the point where the
practical abundance of land, its actual unlimitedness in
proportion to population and capital, would cease to
exist.</p>
<p>It is of course quite certain that the colonists will not
pick out the least fertile land, but will choose the most
fertile, i.e., the land that will produce most, with the
means of cultivation at their disposal.  But this is
not the sole limiting factor in their choice.  The
first deciding factor for them is the <i>situation</i>, the
situation near the sea, large rivers etc.  The land in
West America etc. may be as fertile as any; but the settlers
of course established themselves in New England,
Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia etc., in short, on
the east coast of the Atlantic.  If they selected the
most fertile land, then they only selected the <i>most
fertile land in this region</i>.  This did not prevent
them from cultivating <i>more fertile</i> land in the West,
at a later stage, as soon as growth of population, formation
of capital, development of means of communication, building
of towns, made the <i>more fertile land</i> in this <i>more
distant</i> region accessible to them.  They do not
look for the <i>most fertile region</i>, but for the <i>most
favourably situated region</i>, and within this, of
course—given <i>equal</i> conditions so far as the
situation is concerned—they look for the <i>most
fertile</i> land.  But this certainly does not prove
that they progress from the more fertile region to the less
fertile region, only that within <i>the same</i>
region—provided the situation is the same—the
more fertile land is naturally cultivated before the
unfertile.</p>
<p>Ricardo, however, having rightly <i>amended</i>
“… abundance of rich and fertile
land…“ to read land of the “<i>same
properties</i> […] unlimited in quantity […]
uniform in quality”, comes to his example and from
there jumps back into the first false assumption:</p>
<p class="quote">“The most <i>fertile, and most
favourably situated</i>, land will be <i>first
cultivated</i>” (l.c., p.  60).</p>
<p>He senses the weakness and spuriousness [in this] and
therefore adds the <i>new</i> condition to the “most
fertile land”: “and the most favourably
situated”, which was missing at the outset. 
“The most fertile land <i>within</i> the most
favourable situation” is how it should obviously read,
and surely this absurdity cannot be carried so far [as to
say] that the region of the country that happens to be the
most favourably situated for the newcomers, since it enables
them to keep in contact with the mother country and the old
folks at home and the outside world, is “the most
fertile region” in the whole of the land, which the
colonists have not yet explored and are as yet unable to
explore.</p>
<p>The assumption of the descending line, the transition
from the more fertile to the less fertile region, is thus
surreptitiously brought in.  All that can be said is
this: In the region that is first cultivated, because it is
the most favourably situated, <i>no rent</i> is paid until,
<i>within</i> this region, there is a transition from the
more fertile to the less fertile land.  Now if,
however, there is a transition to a second, <i>more
fertile</i> region than the first, then, according to the
assumption, this is <i>worse situated</i>.  Hence it is
possible that the greater fertility of the soil is more than
counterbalanced by the greater disadvantage of the
situation, and in this case the land of region I will
continue to pay rent.  But the “situation”
is a circumstance which changes historically, according to
the economic development, and <i>must</i> continually
<i>improve</i> with the installation of means of
communication, the building of towns, etc., and the growth
of the population.  Hence it is clear that by and by,
the product produced in region II will be brought on to the
market at a price which will lower the rent in region I
again (for the same product), and that in time it will
emerge as the more fertile soil in the measure in which the
disadvantage of situation disappears.</p>
<p><span class="context">||603|</span> It is therefore
clear,</p>
<p>that where Ricardo himself states the condition for the
formation of differential rent correctly and in general
form: “…all land had<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[b]</a> the <i>same properties …
unlimited in quantity … uniform in
quality …</i>“, the circumstance of the
transition from more fertile to less fertile land is
<i>not</i> included,</p>
<p>that this [transition] is also historically incorrect for
the settlement in the United States which, in common with
Adam Smith, he has in mind; therefore Carey’s objections,
which were justified on this point,</p>
<p>that Ricardo himself reverses the problem again, by his
addendum on “situation”: “The most
fertile, and <i>most favourably situated</i>, land will be
first cultivated…”,</p>
<p>that Ricardo <i>proves</i> his <i>arbitrary</i>
presupposition by an <i>example</i> in which that which is
to be proved, is <i>postulated</i>, namely, the transition
from the best to increasingly worse land,</p>
<p>that, finally &lt;it is true, already with an eye to the
explanation of the tendency of the general rate of profit to
fall&gt; he presupposes this, because he could not otherwise
account for <i>differential rent</i>, although the latter in
no way depends on whether there is a transition from I to
II, III, IV or from IV to III, II, I.</p>
<p><a id="s2"> </a></p>
<h3>[2.  The Ricardian Assertion that Rent Cannot
Possibly Influence the Price of Corn.  Absolute Rent
Causes the Prices of Agricultural Products to Rise]</h3>
<p>In the example, three sorts of land are postulated,
Nos. 1, 2, 3, which, with an equal capital investment, yield
“a net produce” of 100, 90, 80 quarters of
corn.  No. 1 is the first to be cultivated</p>
<p class="quote">“in a new country, where there is an
abundance of fertile land compared with the population, and
where therefore it is only necessary to cultivate
No. 1” (l.c., p. 57).</p>
<p>In this case the “whole net produce” belongs
to the “cultivator” and “will be the
profits of the stock which he advances” (l.c.,
p. 57).  That this “net produce” is
immediately regarded as profit of stock, although <i>no
capitalist production</i> has been postulated in this case
&lt;we are not speaking of plantations&gt; is also
unsatisfactory here.  But it may be that the colonist
coming from “the old country”, looks at it in
this way himself.  If the population grows only to such
an extent that No. 2 has to be cultivated, then No. 1 bears
a rent of 10 quarters.  It is of course assumed here
that No. 2 and No. 3 are “<i>unappropriated</i>”
and that their quantity has remained practically
“unlimited” in proportion to population and
capital.  Otherwise there <i>could</i> be a different
turn to events.  Under this assumption, therefore,
No. 1 will bear a rent of 10 quarters:</p>
<p class="quote">“For either there must <i>be two
rates of profit on agricultural capital</i>, or ten
quarters, or the value of ten quarters, <i>must be
withdrawn</i> from the produce of No. 1, for some other
purpose.  Whether the <i>proprietor of the land</i>, or
any other person, cultivated No. 1, these ten quarters would
equally constitute rent; for the cultivator of No. 2 would
get the same result with his capital, whether he cultivated
No. 1, paying ten quarters for rent, or continued to
cultivate No. 2, paying no rent” (l.c., p. 58).</p>
<p>In fact, there would be two rates of profit in
agricultural capital, that is, No. 1 supplied an <i>excess
profit</i> of 10 quarters (which, in this case, <i>can</i>
consolidate itself as rent).  But two pages later,
Ricardo himself says that not only two but many very
different rates of profit on capital of the same description
within <i>the same sphere of production</i>, hence also on
agricultural capital, are not only possible but
inevitable:</p>
<p class="quote">“The most fertile, and most favorably
situated, land will be first cultivated, and the
exchangeable value of its produce will be adjusted in the
same manner as the exchangeable value of all other
commodities, by the total quantity of labour necessary in
various forms, from first to last, to produce it, and bring
it to market.  When land of an inferior quality is
taken into cultivation, the exchangeable value of raw
produce will rise, because more labour is required to
produce it.</p>
<p class="quote">“The <i>exchangeable value</i> of
<i>all</i> commodities, whether they he manufactured, or the
produce of the mines, or the produce of land, <i>is always
regulated</i>, not by <i>the less quantity of labour that
will suffice for their production under circumstances highly
favorable</i>, and <i>exclusively enjoyed by those who have
peculiar facilities of production;</i> but by the <i>greater
quantity of labour necessarily bestowed on their
production</i> by <i>those who have no such facilities;</i>
by those who continue to produce them under the most
<i>unfavorable circumstances;</i> meaning—by the most
unfavorable circumstances, the most unfavorable under which
the <i>quantity of produce required,” &lt;</i>at the
old price&gt; “renders it necessary to carry on the
production” (l.c., pp.  60-61).</p>
<p>Thus in each <i>particular</i> industry [there are] not
only two, but <i>many rates</i> of profit, that is to say,
deviations from the general rate of profit.</p>
<p>At this point it is not necessary to go into the further
details of the example (pp. 58-59), which is concerned with
the effect of employing different amounts of capital on the
same land.  Only these two propositions [to be
noted]:</p>
<p>1.  “Rent is always the difference between the
produce obtained by the employment of two <span class="context">||604|</span> equal quantities of capital
and labour” (l.c., p.  59).</p>
<p>In other words, there is only a differential rent
(according to the assumption that there is no <i>landed
property</i>).  For:</p>
<p>2.  “there cannot be two rates of
profit” (l.c., p. 59).</p>
<p class="quote">“It is true, that on the best land,
the same produce would still be obtained with the same
labour as before, but its value would be enhanced in
consequence of the diminished returns obtained by those who
employed fresh labour and stock on the less fertile
land.  Notwithstanding, then, that the advantages of
fertile over inferior lands are in no case lost, but only
<i>transferred</i> from the cultivator, or consumer, to the
landlord, yet, since more labour is required on the inferior
lands, and <i>since it is from such land o n l y
that we are enabled to furnish ourselves</i> with the
<i>additional supply</i> of raw produce, the comparative
value of that produce will continue <i>permanently</i> above
its former level, and make it exchange for more hats, cloth,
shoes, etc. […], in the production of which no such
additional quantity of labour is required.</p>
<p class="quote">“The reason then, <i>why</i> raw
<i>produce rises in comparative value</i>, is because more
labour is employed in the production of the last portion
obtained, and <i>not because a rent is paid to the
landlord</i>.  The <i>value of corn is regulated</i> by
the quantity of labour bestowed on its production on that
quality of land, or with that portion of capital, which pays
no rent.  <i>Corn is not high because a rent is p a i
d</i>, <i>but a rent is paid because corn is high;</i> and
it has been <i>justly</i> observed, that <i>no reduction
would take place in the price of corn, although landlords
should forego the whole of their rent</i>.  Such a
measure would only enable some farmers to live like
gentlemen, but would not diminish the quantity of labour
necessary to raise raw produce on the least productive land
in cultivation” (l.c., pp. 62-63).</p>
<p>My earlier explanations render it unnecessary to expand
here on the erroneousness of the proposition that “the
value of corn is regulated by the quantity of labour
bestowed on its production on that quality of land …
which pays no rent” (l.c., p. 63).  I have shown
that whether the last type of land pays rent, [or] pays no
rent, [whether it] pays the whole of the absolute rent,
[only a] part of it, or it pays besides the absolute rent a
differential rent (if the line is ascending), partly depends
on the direction of the line, whether it is ascending or
descending, and at all events, it depends on the relative
composition of agricultural capital as compared with the
composition of nonagricultural capital and, if as a result
of the difference in this composition absolute rent is
presupposed, the above cases depend on the state of the
market.  But the Ricardian case in particular can only
occur under two circumstances (although even then
<i>fermage</i> can yet be paid, though no rent); either when
landed property does not exist, in law or in fact, or when
the best land provides an additional supply which can only
find its place within the market if there is a fall in
market-value.</p>
<p>But there is more besides which is wrong or one-sided in
the above passage.  The comparative value—which
here means nothing but market-value—of raw produce can
rise for reasons other than the above.  [Firstly] if,
up to now, it was sold below its value, perhaps below its
cost-price; this is always the case in a certain state of
society, where the production of raw produce is as yet
largely directed to the subsistence of the cultivator (also
in the Middle Ages, when the product of the town secured a
monopoly price); secondly, it can also happen when the raw
produce—in <i>contrast</i> to the other commodities
which are sold at their cost-price—is not yet sold at
its value.</p>
<p>Finally, it is correct to say that it makes no difference
to the price of corn if the landlord forgoes the
differential rent and the farmer pockets it.  But this
does not apply to absolute rent.  It is wrong to say
here that landed property does <i>not</i> enhance the price
of the raw produce.  On the contrary the price goes up
because the intervention of landed property causes the raw
produce to be sold at its <i>value</i> which exceeds its
<i>cost-price</i>.  Supposing, as above, that the
average non-agricultural capital consists of 80c+20v and the
surplus-value is 50 per cent, then the rate of profit is 10
[per cent] and the value of the produce is 110, The
agricultural <span class="context">||605|</span> capital on
the other hand consists of 60c+40v, the value [of the
produce] is 120.  The raw produce is sold at this
value.  If landed property did not exist
legally—or in practice, because of the relative
abundance of land as in the colonies—then it would be
sold at 115.  For the total profit of the first and the
second capital (i.e., on the 200) equals 30, hence average
profit equals 15.  The non-agricultural produce would
be sold at 115 instead of 110; the agricultural produce at
115 instead of 120.  The relative value of the
agricultural produce compared with the non-agricultural
produce would thus fall by one-twelfth; the <i>average
profit</i> for both capitals—or the total capital,
agricultural as well as industrial—would, however,
rise by 50 per cent, from 10 to 15.  <span class="context">|605||</span></p>
<h4>***</h4>
<p><span class="context">||636|</span> Of his own conception
of rent, Ricardo says:</p>
<p class="quote">“I always consider it as the result
of a <i>partial monopoly</i>, never really regulating
price” [l.c., pp. 332-33]</p>
<p>(that is, never acting as a <i>monopoly</i>, hence also
never the <i>result</i> of monopoly.  For him the only
result of monopoly could be that the rent is pocketed by the
owner of the better types of land rather than by the
farmer),</p>
<p class="quote">“…but rather as the effect of
it.  If <i>all rent were relinquished by landlords</i>,
I am of opinion, that the commodities produced on the land
would be no cheaper, because there is always a portion of
the same commodities produced on land, for which <i>no
rent</i> is or can be paid, as the <i>surplus produce</i>
is only sufficient to pay the profits of stock” (l.c.,
p. 333).</p>
<p>Here surplus produce is equal to the excess over the
product absorbed by the wages.  Assuming that certain
land never pays rent Ricardo’s assertion is only correct if
this land, or rather its product, regulates the
market-value.  If, on the other hand, its product pays
no rent because the market-value is regulated by the more
fertile land, then this fact proves nothing.</p>
<p>It would, indeed, benefit the farmers if the differential
rent were “relinquished by landlords”.  The
relinquishment of absolute rent, on the other hand, would
reduce the price of agricultural products and increase that
of industrial products to the extent that the average profit
grew by this process.  <span class="context">|636||</span></p>
<h4>***</h4>
<p><span class="context">||605|</span> “The rise of
rent is <i>always</i> the effect of the increasing wealth of
the country, <i>and of the difficulty of providing food for
its augmented population</i>” (l.c., pp. 65-66).</p>
<p>The latter is wrong.</p>
<p class="quote">“Wealth increases most rapidly in
those countries where the disposable land is most fertile,
where importation is least restricted, and where through
agricultural improvements, productions can be multiplied
without any increase in the proportional quantity of labour,
and where <i>consequently the progress of rent is
slow</i>” (l.c., pp. 66-67).</p>
<p>The absolute amount of rent can also grow when the
<i>rate of rent</i> remains the same and only the capital
invested in agriculture is growing with the growth of
population; it can grow when no rent is paid on I and only a
part of the absolute rent on II, but the differential rent
has risen considerably as a result of their relative
fertility etc.  (See the <i>table</i>.)</p>
<p><a id="s3"> </a></p>
<h3>[3.  Smith’s and Ricardo’s Conception of the
“Natural Price” of the Agricultural Product]</h3>
<p class="quote">“If the high price of corn were the
effect, and not the cause of rent, price would be
proportionally influenced as rents were high or low, and
<i>rent would be a component part of price</i>.  But
that corn which is produced by the greatest quantity of
labour is the regulator of the price of corn; and rent does
not and cannot enter in the least degree as a <i>component
part of its price</i>…  Raw material enters into
the composition of most commodities, but the <i>v a l u
e</i> of that raw material, as well as corn, is regulated by
the <i>productiveness of the portion of capital last
employed on the land, and paying no rent;</i> and
<i>therefore</i> rent is not <i>a component part of the p r
i c e of</i> commodities” (l.c., p. 67).</p>
<p>There is much confusion here, resulting from the jumbling
up of “natural <i>price</i>” (for that is the
price under discussion here) and <i>value</i>, Ricardo has
adopted this confusion from Smith.  In the case of the
latter it is relatively correct, because, and in so far as,
Smith departs from his own correct explanation of
value.  Neither rent nor profit nor wages form <i>a
component part of the value</i> of a commodity.  On the
contrary, <i>the value of a commodity being given</i>, the
different parts into which that value may be <i>divided</i>,
belong either to the category of accumulated labour
(constant capital) or wages or profit or rent.  On the
other hand, when referring to the <i>natural price</i> or
<i>cost-price</i>, Smith can speak of its <i>component
parts</i> as given preconditions.  But by confusing
natural price with value, he carries this over to the value
of the commodity.</p>
<p>Apart from the fact that the raw material and machinery
(in short the constant capital) enter into production with a
<i>fixed</i> price, which to the capitalist in each
particular sphere of production appears as determined from
outside, there are two things the capitalist must do when
calculating the price of his commodity: he has to add the
<i>price of the wages</i>, and this also appears to him as
given (within certain limits).  The <i>natural
price</i> of the commodity is not the <i>market-price</i>
but the average market-price over a long period, or the
central point towards which the market-price
gravitates.  In this context therefore the <i>price of
wages</i> is on the whole determined by the value of
labour-power.  But the <i>rate of</i> profit—the
natural rate of profit—is determined by the
<i>value</i> of the aggregate of commodities created by the
aggregate of capitals employed in non-agricultural
industry.  For it is the excess of this value over the
value of the constant capital contained in the commodity
plus the value of wages.  The total surplus-value which
the total capital creates, forms the absolute amount of
profit.  The ratio of this absolute amount to the whole
capital advanced determines the general rate of
profit.  Thus this general rate of profit too,
appears—not only to the individual capitalist, but to
the capital in each particular sphere of production—to
be determined externally.  The capitalist must add the
general profit, say of 10 per cent, <span class="context">||606|</span> to the price of the raw
material, etc., contained in the product, and the natural
price of wages thus— as it must appear to him by way
of addition of component parts, or by composition—to
form the natural price of a given commodity.  Whether
the natural price is paid, or more, or less, depends on the
level of the market-price prevailing at the time.  Only
wages and profit enter into <i>cost-price</i> as
distinguished from <i>value;</i> rent enters only in so far
as it is already contained in the price of the expended raw
material, machinery, etc.  That is, it does not enter
as rent for the capitalist, to whom, in any case, the price
of raw produce, machinery, in short of the constant capital,
appears as a <i>predetermined total</i>.</p>
<p>Rent does not enter into <i>cost-price</i> as a component
part.  If, in special circumstances, the agricultural
product is sold at its cost-price, then <i>no rent
exists</i>.  <i>Economically</i> landed property does
not then exist for capital, that is, when the product of the
type of land that sells at the cost-price, regulates the
market-value of the product of its sphere.  (The
position in I, Table <i>D</i> is different.)</p>
<p>Or (absolute) <i>rent exists</i>.  In this case the
agricultural product is sold <i>above</i> its
<i>cost-price</i>.  It is sold at its <i>value</i>,
which is above its <i>cost-price</i>.  Rent, however,
enters into the <i>market-value</i> of the product, or,
rather, forms a part of the market-value.  But to the
farmer rent appears as predetermined, in the same way as
profit does to the industrialist.  It is determined by
the excess of the <i>value</i> of the agricultural product
over its <i>cost-price</i>.  The farmer, however,
calculates just like the capitalist: First the outlay,
secondly wages, thirdly the average profit, finally the
rent, which likewise appears to him as fixed.  This is
<i>for him</i> the natural price of wheat, for
instance.  Whether he obtains it, depends, in turn, on
the prevailing state of the market.</p>
<p>If the <i>distinction</i> between <i>cost-price</i> and
<i>value</i> is properly maintained, then rent can
<i>never</i> enter into cost-price as a <i>constituent
part</i>, and one can talk of constituent parts only in
relation to the cost-price as distinguished from the value
of the commodity.  (Like excess profit, differential
rent never enters into <i>cost-price</i>, because it is
nothing but the excess of the market cost-price over
individual cost-price, or the excess of the market-value
over individual value.)</p>
<p>Accordingly, Ricardo is in substance right when, in
opposition to Adam Smith, he declares that rent <i>never</i>
enters into cost-price.  But again he is wrong in that
he proves this, not by differentiating between cost-price
and value, but by identifying the two, as Adam Smith did,
for neither rent nor profit, nor wages form <i>constituent
parts of value</i>, although value is dissolvable into wages
and profits and rent, and, furthermore, the three parts are
of equal importance, <i>if</i> all three exist. 
Ricardo reasons thus: Rent forms no constituent part of the
natural price of agricultural produce, <i>because</i> the
price of the product of the worst land, which is equal to
the <i>cost-price</i> of this product, and to the <i>value
of this product</i>, determines the market-value of
agricultural produce.  Thus rent forms no [constituent]
part of the value because it forms no [constituent] part of
the <i>natural price</i> and this latter is equal to
<i>value</i>.  This however is wrong.  The price
of the product grown on the worst land equals its
<i>cost-price</i>, either because this product is sold
<i>below</i> its value—therefore not as Ricardo says,
because it is sold <i>at its value—or</i> because the
agricultural product belongs to that type, to that class, of
commodities in which, <i>by way of exception</i>, value and
cost-price are <i>identical</i>.  This is the case when
the surplus-value which is made in a particular sphere of
production on a given capital, of say £ 100, happens
to coincide with the surplus-value which on the average
falls to <i>the same</i> relative portion of the total
capital (say £ 100).  This then is Ricardo’s
confusion.</p>
<p>As to <i>Adam Smith:</i> in so far as he identifies
cost-price with value, he is justified, on the basis of this
false assumption, in saying that rent, as well as profit and
wages, form “constituent parts of the natural
price”.  On the contrary it is rather
inconsistent that later in his further exposition he asserts
that rent does not enter into the natural price in the same
way as wages and profits.  He commits this
inconsistency because observation and correct analysis
compel him nevertheless to recognise that there is a
difference in the determination of the natural price of
non-agricultural produce and the market-value of
agricultural produce.  But more about this when
discussing Smith’s theory of rent.</p>

<h3>[4.  Ricardo’s Views on Improvements in
Agriculture.  His Failure to Understand the Economic
Consequences of Changes in the Organic Composition of
Agricultural Capital]</h3>
<p><span class="context">||607|</span> “We have seen,
that with every portion of additional capital which it
becomes necessary to employ on the land with a less
productive return, rent would rise.”</p>
<p>(But not every portion of additional capital yields a
less productive return.)</p>
<p class="quote">“It follows from the same principles,
that any circumstances in the society which should make it
unnecessary to employ the same amount of capital on the
land, and which should therefore make the portion last
employed more productive, would lower rent” (l.c.,
p. 68).</p>
<p>That is [lower] absolute rent, not necessarily
differential rent.  (See Table <i>B</i>.)</p>
<p>Such circumstances might be the “reduction in the
capital of a country” followed by a reduction in the
population.  But also a higher development of the
productive powers of agricultural labour.</p>
<p class="quote">“The same effects may however be
produced, when the wealth and population of a country are
increased, if that increase is accompanied by such marked
improvements in agriculture, as shall have the same effect
of diminishing the necessity of cultivating the poorer
lands, or of expending the same amount of capital on the
cultivation of the more fertile portions” (l.c.,
pp. 68-69).</p>
<p>(Oddly enough, Ricardo forgets here: improvements as
shall have the effect of improving the quality of poorer
lands and converting these into richer ones, an aspect
stressed by Anderson.)</p>
<p>The following proposition of Ricardo’s is entirely
wrong:</p>
<p class="quote">“With the same population, and no
more, there can be no demand for any additional quantity of
corn” (l.c., p. 69).</p>
<p>Quite apart from the fact that, with a fall in the price
of corn, an additional demand for other raw produce, green
vegetables, meat, etc., will spring up and that schnaps,
etc., can be made from corn, Ricardo assumes here that the
entire population consumes as much corn as it likes, This is
wrong.</p>
<p>{“Our enormous increase of consumption in 1848, 49,
50, shows that we were previously <i>underfed</i>, and that
prices were forced up by the deficiency of supply.”
(F. W. Newman, <i>Lectures on Political Economy</i>, London,
1851, p. 158.)</p>
<p>The same Newman says:</p>
<p class="quote">“The Ricardo argument,” that
rent cannot enhance price, “turns on the assumption
that the power of demanding rent can in no case of real life
<i>diminish supply</i>.  But why not?  There are
very considerable tracts which would immediately have been
cultivated if no rent could have been demanded for them, but
which were <i>artificially kept vacant</i>, either because
landlords could let them advantageously as shooting ground,
or […] prefer the […] romantic wilderness to
the<a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">[c]</a> petty and
nominal rent which alone they could get by allowing them to
be cultivated.” (l.c., p. 159.)  }</p>
<p>Indeed, [it is] in any case wrong to say that if he
withdraws the land from the production of corn, he may not
get a rent by converting it into pasture or building grounds
or, as in some counties in the highlands of Scotland, into
artificial woods for hunting purposes.</p>
<p>Ricardo distinguishes two kinds of improvements in
agriculture.  The <i>one</i> type</p>
<p class="quote">“[those which] … increase the
<i>productive powers of the land</i> … [are] <i>such
as the more skilful rotation of crops, or the better choice
of manure</i>.  These improvements absolutely enable us
to obtain the same produce from a smaller quantity of
land.” (David Ricardo, <i>On the Principles of
Political Economy, and Taxation</i>, third edition, London,
1821, p. 70.)</p>
<p>In this case, according to Ricardo, the rent <i>must
fall</i>.</p>
<p class="quote">“If, for example, the successive
portions of capital yielded 100, 90, 80, 70; whilst I
employed these four portions, my rent would be 60, or the
difference between</p>

<p>and while I employed these portions, the <i>rent would
remain the same</i>, although the produce of each should
have an <i>equal</i> augmentation.”</p>
<p>(If it had an <i>unequal</i> augmentation, it would be
possible for the rent to rise <i>despite the increased</i>
fertility.)</p>
<p class="body">“If, instead of 100, 90, 80, 70, the produce should be increased
to 125, 115, 105, 95, the rent would still be 60, or the difference between</p>

<p class="quote">(l.c., pp. 71-72).</p>
<p>Apart from demand being able to rise without a growth in
population when the price falls (Ricardo himself assumes
that it has risen by 5 quarters), there is a constant going
over to soils of decreasing fertility, because the
population grows every year, i.e., the part of the
population that consumes corn, eats bread, and this part
grows more rapidly than the population [as a whole], because
bread is the chief means of subsistence of the
majority.  It is thus not necessary to assume that the
demand does not grow with the productivity of capital, and
that consequently the rent falls.  And the rent can
rise, if the difference in the degree of fertility has been
unevenly affected by the improvement.</p>
<p>Otherwise it is certain (Tables B and E), that the
increase in fertility—while demand remains
constant—can not only throw the worst land out of the
market but can even force a part of the capital on better
land (Table B) to withdraw from the production of
corn.  In this case the corn rent falls, if the
augmentation of the produce is equal on the different types
of land.</p>
<p>Now Ricardo passes on to the second aspect of
agricultural improvements.</p>
<p class="quote">“But there are improvements which may
lower the relative value of produce without lowering the
corn rent, though they will lower the money <i>rent of
land</i>.  Such improvements do not increase the
productive powers of the land; but they enable us to obtain
its produce <i>with less labour</i>.  They are rather
directed to the <i>formation of the capital applied to the
land</i>, than to the <i>cultivation of the land
itself.  Improvements in agricultural implements</i>,
such as the plough and the thrashing machine, economy in the
use of horses employed in husbandry, and a better knowledge
of the veterinary art, are of this nature.  <i>Less
capital</i>, which <i>is the same thing as less labour</i>,
will be employed on the land; but to <i>obtain the same
produce, less land cannot be cultivated</i>.  Whether
improvements of this kind, however, affect <i>corn rent</i>,
must depend on the question, whether the difference between
the produce obtained by the employment of different portions
of capital be increased, stationary, or diminished”
(l.c., p. 73).</p>
<p>&lt;Ricardo should also have adhered to this when dealing
with the <i>natural fertility of the soils</i>. 
Whether the transition to these reduces the differential
rent, leaves it stationary, or increases it, depends on
whether the difference in the produce of the capital
employed on these different more fertile soils, be
increased, stationary, or diminished.&gt;</p>
<p class="quote">“If four portions of capital, 50, 60,
70, 80, be employed on the land, giving each <i>the same
results</i>, and any improvement in the formation of such
capital should enable me to withdraw 5 from each, so that
they should be 45, 55, 65 and 75, no alteration would take
place in the corn rent; but if the improvements were such as
to enable me to make the whole saving on that portion of
capital, which is least productively employed, corn rent
would immediately fall, because the difference between the
capital most productive, and the capital least productive,
<span class="context">||609|</span> would be diminished; and
<i>it is this difference which constitutes rent</i>”
(l.c., pp. 73-74).</p>
<p>This is correct for <i>differential rent</i>, which alone
exists for Ricardo.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ricardo does not touch upon the real
question at all.  For the solution of this question it
does not matter whether the value of the individual quarter
falls or whether the same <i>quantity of land</i>, the same
types of land as previously, needs to be cultivated, but
whether as a result of the <i>reduction in the price of
constant capital—which</i>, according to the
assumption, costs less labour—the quantity of
immediate labour employed in agriculture is <i>reduced,
increased</i> or <i>unaltered</i>.  In short, whether
or not the capital undergoes an organic change.</p>
<p>Let us take our example from Table <i>A</i> (page 574,
notebook XI) and let us substitute quarters of corn for
tons.</p>
<p>It is assumed here that the composition of the
non-agricultural capital is £ 80c+£ 20v, that of
the agricultural capital £ 60c+£40v, the rate of
surplus-value in both cases being 50 per cent.  Hence
the rent on the agricultural capital, or the excess of its
value over its cost-price, is £ 10.  Thus we have

<p>In order to examine the problem in its pure form, one
must assume that the <i>magnitude of the capital employed in
I, II, III</i> is in all three classes affected
<i>equally</i> by the reduction in the price of <i>constant
capital</i> (100).  For the <i>uneven</i> effect only
concerns differential rent, and has nothing to do with the
matter in hand.  Supposing, therefore, that as a result
of <i>improvements</i>, the same amount of capital, which
previously cost £ 100, now only costs 90, it would
thus be reduced by one-tenth, or 10 per cent.  The
question is then how the improvements affect the composition
of agricultural capital.</p>
<p>If the proportion of capital used as wages [to constant
capital] remains the same, then if [£] 100 consists of
£ 60c+£40v, £ 90 consists of £
54c+£ 36v, and in this case the value of the 60
quarters on land I is £ 108.  But if the
<i>reduction in price</i> were such that the same constant
capital which previously cost £ 60, now only cost
£ 54, but that <i>v</i> (or the capital laid out in
wages) now only cost £ 32 <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">5</sub>
instead of 36 (had also fallen by
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">10</sub>) , then £ 86
<sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">5</sub> would be laid out instead of
£ 100.  The composition of this capital would be
54c+32 <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">5</sub>v.  And reckoned on
£ 100, the composition would be £ 62
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">2</sub>c+£ <i>37
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">2</sub>v</i>.  Under these
circumstances, the value of the 60 quarters on I would be
equal to £ 102 <sup class="ratio">3</sup>/<sub class="ratio">5</sub>. 
Finally, let us assume that although the value of the
constant capital decreases, the capital laid out in wages
remains <i>the same</i> absolutely, it therefore grows in
<i>proportion</i> to the constant capital; so that the
capital of £ 90 which has been laid out consists of
50c+40v, the composition of [a capital of] 100 would be
<i>55 <sup class="ratio">5</sup>/<sub class="ratio">9</sub>c+44
<sup class="ratio">4</sup>/<sub class="ratio">9</sub>v</i>.</p>
<p>Now let us see what happens to corn and money rent in
these three cases.  In case <i>B</i> the proportion of
<i>c</i> to <i>v</i> remains the same although the value of
both decreases.  In <i>C</i> the <span class="context">||610|</span> value of c decreases, but
proportionately, that of <i>v</i> decreases even more. 
In <i>D</i>, only the value of c decreases, not that of
<i>v</i>.</p>
<p><i>First let us reproduce the original table contained on
the previous page</i> [and then let us compare it with the
new tables <i>B</i>, <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>, representing the
cases just described illustrating changes in value of the
organic component parts of the agricultural capital]<a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4">[d]</a></p>
<h4>***</h4>
<p><span class="context">||611|</span> From the accompanying
table it is evident that :</p>
<p><i>Originally</i> in <i>A</i> the ratio is £
60c+£ 40v; the capital invested m each class is
100.  The rent in money amounts to £ 70, in corn
to 35 quarters.</p>
<p>In <i>B</i> the constant capital becomes cheaper so that
only £ 90 [are] invested in each class, the variable
capital however becomes cheaper in the same proportion, so
that the <i>ratio</i> remains the same.  Here the
<i>money rent</i> falls, the corn rent remains the same;
[the] <i>absolute rent</i> is also <i>the same</i>. 
Money rent decreases because the capital invested
decreases.  Corn rent remains the same, because less
money [produces relatively] more corn the ratio remaining
the same.</p>
<p>In <i>C</i> cheaper constant capital; but [the value of]
v decreases even more, so that the constant capital becomes
relatively dearer.  <i>Absolute rent</i> falls. 
Corn rent falls and money rent falls.  Money rent,
because capital in general has decreased significantly, and
corn rent, because absolute rent has fallen while the
differences (between the various categories] have remained
the same, therefore all of them fall equally.</p>
<p>In <i>D</i>, however, the case is completely the
reverse.  Only the constant capital falls; the variable
capital remains the same.  <i>This was Ricardo’s
assumption</i>.  In this case, because of the fall in
capital, the money rent falls, though the fall is quite
insignificant, in absolute figures it is only [£]
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>, but in proportion to the capital
laid out, it rises considerably.  The corn rent, on the
other hand, grows absolutely.  Why?  Because the
absolute rent has risen from 10 to 12
<sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">9</sub> per cent, because v has grown in
proportion to <i>c</i>.  Hence:</p>

<p>Ricardo continues:</p>
<p class="quote">“Whatever diminishes the
<i>inequality in the produce</i> obtained from successive
portions of capital employed on the same or on new land,
tends to lower rent; and […] whatever <i>increases
that inequality</i>, necessarily produces an opposite
effect, and tends to raise it” (l.c., p. 74).</p>
<p>The inequality can be increased, while capital is
withdrawn and while fertility increases, or even while the
less fertile land is thrown out of the market.</p>
<p>{Landlord and capitalist.  In a leader of 15th July,
1862, the <i>Morning Star</i> [examines] whose duty it is
(voluntarily or compulsorily) to support the distressed (as
a result of the cotton famine and the civil war in America)
workmen in the cotton manufacture districts of Lancashire,
etc.  It says:</p>
<p class="quote">“These people have a legal right to
maintenance <i>out of the property they have mostly created
by their industry</i>…  It is said that the men
who have made fortunes by <i>the</i> cotton industry are
those upon whom it is especially incumbent to come forward
with a generous relief.  No doubt it is so … the
mercantile and manufacturing sections […] have done
so…  But are these the only class which has made
money by the cotton manufacture?  Assuredly not. 
The landed proprietors of Lancashire and North Cheshire have
enormously participated in the wealth thus produced. 
And it is the peculiar advantage of these proprietors to
have participated in the wealth without lending a hand or a
thought to the industry that […] created
it…  The mill-owner has given his capital, his
skill, and his unwinking vigilance to the <span class="context">||612|</span> creation of this great
industry, now staggering under so heavy a blow; the
mill-hand has given his skill, his time, and his bodily
labour; but what have the landed proprietors of Lancashire
given?  Nothing at all—literally nothing; and yet
they have made from it more substantial gains than either of
the other classes … it is certain that the increase
of the yearly income of these great landlords, attributable
to this single cause, is something enormous, probably not
less than threefold.”</p>
<p>The capitalist is the direct exploiter of the workers,
not only the direct appropriator but the direct creator of
<i>surplus-labour</i>.  But since (for the industrial
capitalist) this can only take place through and in the
process of production, he is himself a functionary of this
production, its director.  The landlord, on the other
hand, has a claim—through landed property (to absolute
rent) and because of the physical differences of the various
types of land (differential rent)-which enables him to
pocket a part of this surplus-labour or surplus-value, to
whose direction and creation he contributes nothing. 
Where there is a conflict, therefore, the capitalist regards
him as a mere super-fetation, a Sybarite excrescence, a
parasite on capitalist production, the louse that sits upon
him.}</p>

Mines</i>” [David Ricardo, <i>On the Principles of
Political Economy, and Taxation</i>, third edition, London,
1821, p. 76].</p>

<p>Here again:</p>
<p class="quote">“… this rent” (of mines)
“as well as the rent of land, is the effect, and never
the cause of the <i>high value</i> of their produce”
(l.c., p. 76).</p>
<p>So far as absolute rent is concerned, it is neither
effect nor cause of the “<i>high value</i>”, but
the effect of the excess of value over cost-price. 
That this excess is paid for the produce of the mine, or the
land, and thus absolute rent is formed, is the effect, not
of that <i>excess</i>, because it exists for a whole class
of trades, where it does not enter into the price of the
produce of those particular branches of production, but is
the effect of <i>landed property</i>.</p>
<p>In regard to <i>differential rent</i> it may be said,
that it is the effect of “<i>high value”;</i> so
far as by “high value” is understood the excess
of the market-value of the produce over its real or
individual value, for the relatively more fertile classes of
land or mine.</p>
<p>That Ricardo understands by the “exchangeable
value” regulating the produce of the poorest land or
mine, nothing but <i>cost-price</i>, by cost-price nothing
but the advances plus the ordinary profit, and that he
falsely identifies this cost-price with real value, will
also be seen from the following passage:</p>
<p class="quote">“The metal produced from the poorest
mine that is worked, must at least have an exchangeable
value, not only sufficient to procure all the clothes, food,
and other necessaries consumed by those employed in working
it, and bringing the produce to market, but <i>also to
afford the common and ordinary profits</i> to him who
advances the stock necessary to carry on the
undertaking.  The return for capital from the poorest
mine paying no rent, would regulate the rent of all the
other more productive mines.  <i>This mine is supposed
to yield the usual profits of stock.  All that the
other mines p r o d u c e m o r e than t h i s</i>, will
necessarily be paid to the owners for rent” (l.c.,
pp. <i>76-77</i>).</p>
<p>Here, therefore, [he says] in plain language: rent equals
<i>excess</i> of <i>the price (exchangeable value is the
same here) of the agricultural produce over its
cost-price</i>, that is over the value of capital advanced
plus the usual (average) profits of stock.  Hence, if
the <i>value</i> of the agricultural produce is higher than
its cost-price, it can pay rent quite irrespectively of
differences in land, the poorest land and the poorest mine
can pay the same absolute rent as the richest.  If its
<i>value</i> were no higher than its cost-price, rent could
only arise from the excess of the market-value over the real
value of the produce derived from relatively more fertile
soils, etc.</p>
<p class="quote">“<i>If equal quantities of labour,
with equal quantities of fixed capital</i>, could at all
times obtain, from that mine which paid no rent, <i>equal
quantities of</i> gold…  <i>The
quantity</i>” (of gold) “indeed would <i>enlarge
with the demand</i>, but <i>its value would be
invariable</i>” (l.c., p. 79).</p>
<p>What applies to gold and mines, applies to corn and
land.  Hence if the same types of land continued to be

then the <i>value</i> of the pound of gold or the quarter of
wheat would remain the same, although its quantity would
increase with the <i>demand</i>.  Thus <i>its rent</i>
(the amount, not the rate of rent) [would] also <i>grow</i>
without any change in the price of produce.  More
capital would be employed, although productivity would
remain constant.  This is one of the major causes of
the rise in the absolute amount of rent, quite apart from
any rise in the price of produce, and, therefore, without
any proportional change in the rents paid by produce of
different soils and mines.</p>

<h3>[5.  Ricardo’s Criticism of Adam Smith’s and
Malthus’s Views on Rent]</h3>
<p><i>Chapter XXIV “Doctrine of Adam Smith concerning
the Rent of Land</i>.”</p>
<p>This chapter is of great importance for the difference
between Ricardo and Adam Smith.  We shall postpone a
fuller discussion of this (in so far as it affects Adam
Smith), to when we consider <i>ex professo</i> Adam Smith’s
doctrine after that of Ricardo.</p>
<p>Ricardo begins by quoting a passage from Adam Smith
showing that he correctly determined when the price of the
agricultural produce yields a rent and when it does
not.  But on the other hand Smith thought that some
parts of the produce of land, such as food, must always
yield a rent.</p>
<p>In this context Ricardo says the following, which is
significant for <i>him:</i></p>
<p class="quote">“I believe that as yet in every
country, from the rudest to the most refined, there is land
of such a quality that it cannot <i>yield a produce more
than sufficiently valuable</i> to replace the stock employed
upon it, together with the <i>profits ordinary and usual</i>
in that country.  In <i>America</i> we all know that is
the case, and yet no one maintains that the principles which
regulate rent, are different in that country and in
Europe” (l.c., pp. 389-90).</p>
<p>Indeed, these principles are substantially
“different”.  Where <i>no landed
property</i> exists—actual or legal—no absolute
rent can exist.  It is absolute rent, not differential
rent, which is the adequate expression of landed
property.  To say that <i>the same</i> principles
regulate rent, where landed property exists and where it
does not exist, means that the <i>economic form of land-ed
property</i> is independent of whether landed property
exists or not.</p>
<p>Besides, what is the meaning of “there is land of
such a quality that it cannot yield a produce more than
<i>sufficiently valuable</i> to replace the stock …
with the ordinary profits…” (l.c.,
pp. 389-390).  If the same quantity of labour produces
4 quarters, the product is no more valuable than if it
produces two, although the value of the individual quarter
is in one case twice as great as in the other.  Whether
or not it yields a rent, is therefore in no way independent
on the magnitude of this “value” of the produce
as such.  It can only yield a rent if its value is
higher than its cost-price, which depends on the cost-price
of all other products or, in other words, on the quota of
unpaid labour which is, on an average, appropriated by a
capital of £ 100 in each sphere of production. 
But whether its value is higher than its cost-price is in no
way dependent on its absolute size, but on the composition
of the capital employed on it, compared with the average
composition of the capital employed in non-agricultural
industry.</p>
<p class="quote">“But if it were true that England had
so far advanced in cultivation, that at this time there were
no lands remaining which did not afford a rent, it would be
equally true, that there formerly must have been such lands;
and that whether there be or not, is of no importance to
this question, for it is the same thing if there be any
capital employed in Great Britain on land which yields only
the return of stock with its ordinary profits, whether it be
employed on old or on new land.  If a farmer agrees for
land on a lease of seven or fourteen years, he may propose
to employ on it a capital of £10,000, knowing that at
the existing price of grain and raw produce, he can replace
that part of his stock which he is obliged to expend, pay
his rent, and obtain the general rate of profit.  He
will not employ £ 11,000, unless the last £1,000
can be employed so productively as to afford him the usual
profits of stock.  In <i>his calculation, whether he
shall employ it or not, he considers only whether the price
of raw produce is sufficient to replace his expenses and
profits, for he knows that he shall have no additional rent
to pay</i>.  Even at the expiration of his lease his
rent will not he raised; for if his landlord should require
rent, because this additional £1,000 was employed, he
would withdraw it; since, by employing it, he gets, by the
supposition, only the ordinary and usual profits which he
may obtain by any other employment of stock; and, therefore,
he <i>cannot afford to pay rent for it</i>, unless the
<i>price of raw produce should further rise</i>, or,
<i>which is the same thing</i>, unless <i>the usual and
general rate of profits should fall</i>” (l.c.,
pp. 390-91).</p>
<p>Ricardo admits here that also the worst land <i>can</i>
bear a rent.  How does he explain this?  To
provide the additional supply which has become necessary in
consequence of an additional demand, a second amount of
capital is employed on the worst land <span class="context">||614|</span>.  This will only yield
the cost-price if the price of grain is rising.  Hence
the first amount would now yield a surplus—that is
rent—over and above this cost-price.  In fact
therefore <i>before</i> the second amount is invested the
<i>first amount</i> of capital yields a rent <i>on the
worst</i> land, because the market-value is above the
cost-price.  Thus the only question is whether, for
this to happen, the market-value has to be <i>above</i> the
value of the worst product, or whether on the contrary its
<i>value</i> is <i>above</i> its <i>cost-price</i>, and the
rise in price merely enables it to be sold at <i>its
value</i>.</p>
<p>Furthermore: Why must the <i>price</i> be so high that it
equals the cost-price, i.e., the capital advanced plus
average profit?  Because of the competition of capitals
in the different branches of production and the transfer of
capital from one branch to another.  That is, as a
result of the action of capital upon capital.  But by
what action could capital compel landed property to allow
the value of the product to fall to the cost-price? 
Withdrawal of capital from agriculture cannot have this
effect, unless it is accompanied by a fall of the demand for
agricultural produce.  It would achieve the reverse,
and cause the market-price of agricultural produce to rise
above its value.  Transfer of new capital to land
cannot have this effect either.  For it is precisely
the competition of capitals amongst themselves, which
enables the landlord to demand from the individual
capitalist that he should be satisfied with “an
average profit” and pay over to him the overplus of
the value over the price affording this profit.</p>
<p>But, it may be asked: If landed property gives the power
to sell the product <i>above</i> its cost-price, <i>at</i>
its value, why does it not equally well give the power to
sell the product <i>above</i> its value, at an arbitrary
monopoly price?  On a small island, where there is no
foreign trade in corn, the corn, food, like every other
product, could unquestionably be sold at a monopoly price,
that is, at a price only limited by the state of demand,
i.e., of <i>demand backed by ability to pay</i>, and
according to the price level of the product supplied the
magnitude and extent of this effective demand can vary
greatly.</p>
<p>Leaving out of account exceptions of this
kind—which cannot occur in European countries; even in
England a large part of the fertile land is
<i>artificially</i> withdrawn from agriculture and from the
market in general, in order to raise the value of the other
part—landed property can only affect and paralyse the
action of capitals, their competition, in so far as the
competition of capitals modifies the determination of the
<i>values of the commodities</i>.  The conversion of
values into cost-prices is only the consequence and result
of the development of capitalist production. 
Originally commodities are (on the average) sold at their
values.  Deviation from this is in agriculture
prevented by landed property.</p>
<p>Ricardo says that when a farmer takes land on a lease of
seven or fourteen years, he calculates that with a capital
investment of, say, £ 10,000, the <i>value of the
corn</i> (average market-value) permits him to replace his
outlay plus average profit, plus the contracted rent. 
In so far as he takes a “lease” of a piece of
land, therefore, his first consideration is the average
market-value, which is equivalent to the value of the
product; profit and rent are only parts into which this
value is <i>resolved</i>, but they do not constitute
it.  The <i>existing market-price</i> is for the
capitalist what the presupposed <i>value</i> of the product
is for the theory and the inner relationships of
production.  Now to the conclusion which Ricardo draws
from this.  If the farmer adds another £ 1,000,
he only considers whether, at the <i>given market-price</i>,
it yields him the usual profit.  Ricardo therefore
seems to think that the <i>cost-price</i> is the determining
factor and that <i>profit</i> enters into this cost-price as
a regulating element, but <i>rent</i> does not.</p>
<p>Firstly, profit too does not enter into it as a
constituent element.  For, according to the assumption,
the farmer takes the <i>market-price</i> as his
starting-point, and weighs up whether, at this given
market-price, the £1,000 will yield him the usual
profit.  This profit is therefore not the cause, but
the effect of that price.  But—Ricardo continues
his train of thought—the investment of the £
1,000 itself is determined by the calculation of whether or
not the price yields the profit.  Thus the profit is
the decisive factor for the investment of the £ 1,000,
and for the price of production.</p>
<p>Furthermore: If the capitalist found that the £
1,000 did not yield the usual profit, he would not invest
it.  The production of the additional food would not
take place.  If it were necessary for the additional
demand, then the demand would have to raise the price, i.e.,
the market-price, until it yielded the profit.  Thus
profit—in contradistinction to rent—enters as a
constituent element, not because it creates the <i>value</i>
of the product, but because the product <span class="context">||615|</span> itself would not be created if
its price did not rise high enough to pay the usual rate of
profit as well as the capital expended.  In <i>this</i>
case, however, it is not necessary for it to rise so high as
to pay rent.  Hence, there exists an essential
difference between rent and profit, and in a certain sense,
it can be said that profit is a constituent element of
price, whereas rent is not.  (This thought is evidently
also at the back of Adam Smith’s mind.)</p>
<p>In this case, it is correct.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>Because <i>in this</i> case landed property <i>cannot</i>
confront capital as landed property, thus the very
combination [of circumstances] under which rent, absolute
rent, is formed, is <i>not</i> present—according to
the assumption.  The additional corn produced with the
second investment of £ 1,000, provided <i>the
market-value remains the same</i>, in other words when an
additional demand arises only <i>on</i> the assumption that
the <i>price</i> remains <i>the same</i>, must be sold
<i>below</i> its value at the cost-price.  This
additional produce of the £ 1,000 thus occurs under
the same circumstances as when new worse land is cultivated,
which <i>does not</i> determine the market-value, but can
provide the additional supply only on the condition that it
supplies it at the <i>previously existing</i> market-value,
i.e., at a price <i>determined independently of this new
production</i>.  Under these circumstances it depends
entirely on the relative fertility of the additional soil
whether it yields a rent precisely because it does
<i>not</i> determine the market-value.  It is just the
same with the additional £ 1,000 on the old
land.  And for this very reason, Ricardo concludes
<i>conversely</i>, that the additional land or the
additional amount of capital <i>determines the
market-value</i> because, with a given, quite
<i>independently determined market-value</i>, the price of
its product yields not rent, but only profit, and only
covers the cost-price but not the value of the
product.  This is a contradiction in terms.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the product is produced <i>in this
case</i>, although it yields no rent!  Certainly. 
Landed property as an independent opposing element does not
exist <i>for the farmer</i>, i.e., the capitalist, during
the period in which the lease in fact makes him the
landowner of the land which he has <i>rented</i>. 
Capital moves unimpeded in this element, and capital is
satisfied with the cost-price of the product.  Even
when the lease expires, the farmer will naturally make the
amount of rent dependent on how far capital investment in
the land will supply a product which can be sold at its
<i>value</i> thus yielding a rent.  Capital investment
which, with the given <i>market-value</i>, yields no excess
over the cost-price, no more enters into the calculation
than would the payment of rent—or contractual
undertaking to pay rent—on land whose relative
fertility is so low that the market-price is merely equal to
the cost-price [of its product].</p>
<p>In practice matters do not always work out in the
Ricardian manner.  If the farmer possesses some spare
capital or acquires some during the first years of a lease
of 14 years, he does not demand the <i>usual profit</i>,
unless he has borrowed additional capital.  For what is
he to do with the spare capital?  Conclude a new lease
for additional land?  Agricultural production favours
to a much higher degree more intensive capital investment,
than a more extensive cultivation of land with <i>a</i>
larger capital.  Moreover, if no land could be leased
in the immediate vicinity of the old land, two farms would
split up the farmer’s work of super-intending them to a much
greater extent, than six factories would split up the work
of one capitalist in manufacture.  Or should he invest
the money with the bank, for interest, in government bonds,
railway shares, etc.?  Then, from the outset, he
forgoes at least a half or a third of the usual
profit.  Hence, if he can invest it as additional
capital on the old farm, even below the average rate of
profit, say at 10 per cent, if his profit was 12, then, he
will still be gaining 100 per cent if the rate of interest
is 5 per cent.  To invest the additional £ 1,000
in the old farm is, therefore, still a profitable
speculation for him.  <span class="context">||616|</span></p>
<p>Hence it is quite wrong for Ricardo to identify this
investment of additional capital with the application of
additional capital to new soils.  In the first case,
the product does not have to yield the usual profit, even in
capitalist production.  It must only yield as much
above the usual rate of interest as will make worth while
the trouble and risk of the farmer to prefer the industrial
employment of his spare capital to its employment as money
capital.</p>
<p>But the following conclusion which Ricardo draws from
this observation is, as has been shown, quite absurd.</p>
<p class="quote">“If the comprehensive mind of Adam
Smith had been directed to this fact, he would not have
maintained that rent forms <i>one of the component parts of
the price of raw produce;</i> for price is everywhere
<i>regulated by</i> the return obtained by this last portion
of capital, for which no rent whatever is paid” (l.c.,
p. 391).</p>
<p>His illustration proves just the <i>reverse:</i> that the
application to land of this last portion of capital has been
regulated by a <i>market-price</i> which, independent of
that application, existed before it took place—and,
therefore comprises no rent, but only profit.  That
profit is the only regulator for capitalist production is
quite true.  And it is therefore true that no absolute
rent would exist if production were regulated <i>solely</i>
by capital.  It arises precisely at the point where the
conditions of production enable the landowner to set up
barriers against the exclusive regulation of production by
capital.</p>
<p>Secondly, Ricardo reproaches Adam Smith (p. 391, et
seq.) for developing the correct principles of rent
[only] with regard to coal-mines; [he] even says:</p>
<p class="quote">“The whole principle of rent is here
admirably and perspicuously explained, but every word is as
applicable to land as it is to mines; yet he affirms that
‘it is otherwise in estates above
ground…’” (l.c., p. 392).</p>
<p>Adam Smith senses that, under certain circumstances, the
landlord has the power to offer effective resistance to
capital, to bring landed property into play, and thus to
demand absolute rent, though, under different circumstances,
he does not possess this power; that in particular however
the production of food establishes the law of rent, whereas
in other applications of capital to land, the rent is
determined by the agricultural rent.</p>
<p class="quote">“The proportion, both of their
produce and of their rent, is in proportion” (says
Adam Smith) “to their <i>absolute</i>, and not to
their <i>relative</i> fertility” (l.c., p. 392).</p>
<p>In his reply, Ricardo comes closest to the real principle
of rent.  He says:</p>
<p class="quote">“But, suppose that <i>there were no
land which did not afford a rent; then</i>, <i>the amount of
rent on the worst land would be in proportion to the excess
of the value of the produce above the expenditure of capital
and the ordinary profits of stock:</i> the same principle
would govern the rent of land of a somewhat better quality,
or more favourably situated, and, therefore, the rent of
this land would exceed the rent of that inferior to it, by
the superior advantages which it possessed; the same might
be said of that of the third quality, and so on to the very
best.  Is it not, then, as certain, that it is <i>the
relative fertility of the land</i>, which determines the
portion of the produce, which shall be paid for the rent of
land, as it is that the <i>relative fertility of mines</i>,
determines the portion of their produce, which shall be paid
for the rent of mines?” (l.c., pp. 392-93.)</p>
<p>Here Ricardo formulates the correct principle of rent, If
the worst land pays a rent, if therefore rent is paid
independently of the different natural fertility of the
land—i.e., absolute rent—then this rent must
equal “the excess of the <i>value</i> of the produce
<i>above</i> the expenditure of capital and the ordinary
profits of stock” [l.c., pp. 392-93] that is to say,
it must equal the excess of the <i>value</i> of the produce
<i>above</i> its cost-price.  Ricardo presupposes that
such an excess cannot exist, because, in contradiction to
his own principles, he wrongly accepts the Smithian doctrine
<span class="context">||617|</span> that value equals
cost-price of the produce.</p>
<p>As for the rest, he falls again into error.</p>
<p>Differential rent would of course be determined by the
“relative fertility”.  Absolute rent would
have nothing to do with the “natural
fertility”.</p>
<p>Smith however would indeed be right when he asserts that
the <i>actual</i> rent paid by the worst land <i>may</i>
depend on the absolute fertility of the other soils and the
relative fertility of the worst soil, or on the absolute
fertility of the worst soil and the relative fertility of
the other soils.</p>
<p>For the actual amount of rent paid by the worst land
depends not, as Ricardo thinks, on the excess of the
<i>value</i> of its own produce over its cost-price, but on
the excess of the <i>market-value</i> over its
cost-price.  But these are very different things If the
market-price were determined by the <i>product of the worst
land</i>, then the market-value would be equal to its real
value, hence, the excess of its market-value over its
cost-price would be equal to the excess of its own
individual value, its real value, over its cost-price. 
But this is not the case if quite irrespective of this
product the market-price is determined by the other types of
land.  Ricardo assumes a descending line.  He
assumes that the worst land is cultivated <i>last</i> and is
only cultivated (in the case postulated), when the
additional demand has necessitated an additional supply at
the value of the produce derived from the worst and last
cultivated soil.  In this case the value of the worst
land regulates the market-value.  In the ascending line
(even according to him) this will only occur when the
additional supply of the better sorts of land only equals
the additional demand at the old market-value.  If the
additional supply is greater, Ricardo assumes that the old
land must be thrown <i>out of cultivation</i>, but it only
follows from this that it will yield a <i>lower rent</i>
than before (or no rent at all).</p>
<p>The same happens in the descending line.  Whether,
and to what extent, the worse land yields rent, if the
additional supply can only by provided at the <i>old
market-value</i>, depends on how much this market-value
stands above the cost-price of the product of the new, worse
land.  In both cases its rent is determined by the
<i>absolute</i> fertility, not the relative fertility. 
It depends on the absolute fertility of the new land how far
the market-value of the produce of better lands stands
<i>above</i> its own real, individual value.</p>
<p>Adam Smith makes a correct distinction here between land
and mines, because with the latter he presupposes that there
is <i>never</i> a transition to worse sorts—always to
<i>better</i> ones—and that they always provide more
than the necessary additional supply.  The rent of the
worst land is then dependent on its absolute fertility.</p>
<p class="quote">“After Adam Smith has declared that
there are some mines <i>which can only be worked by the
owners</i>, as they will afford only sufficient to defray
the expense of working, together with the ordinary profits
of the capital employed, <i>we should expect that he would
admit that it was these particular mines which regulated the
price of the produce from a l l mines</i>.  If the old
mines are insufficient to supply the quantity of coal
required, the <i>price of coal will rise</i>, and will
continue rising till the owner of a new and inferior mine
finds that he can obtain the usual profits of stock by
working his<a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5">[e]</a>
mine…  It appears, then, that <i>it is always
the least fertile mine which regulates the price of
coal</i>.  Adam Smith, however, is of a different
opinion: he observes that ‘the most fertile coal-mine,
too, regulates the price of coals at all the other mines in
its neighbourhood.  Both the proprietor and the
undertaker of the work find, the one, that he can get a
greater rent, the other, that he can get a greater profit,
by somewhat underselling all their neighbours.  Their
neighbours are soon obliged to sell <i>at the same
price</i>, though they cannot so well afford it, and though
it always diminishes, and sometimes takes away altogether,
both their rent and their profit.  Some works are
abandoned altogether; others can afford no rent, <i>and can
be wrought only by the proprietor</i>’.  If the
demand for coal should be diminished, <span class="context">||617a|</span> or if by new processes the
quantity should be increased, the <i>price would fall</i>,
and some mines would be <i>abandoned;</i> but in <i>every
case</i>, the <i>price must be sufficient</i> to <i>pay the
expenses and profit of that mine which is worked without
being charged with rent</i>.  It is, <i>therefore</i>,
the least fertile mine which regulates price.  Indeed,
it is so stated in another place by Adam Smith himself, for
be says: ‘<i>The lowest price</i> at which coals can
be <i>sold</i> for any considerable time is like that of all
other commodities, the price which is barely sufficient to
replace, together with its ordinary profits, the stock which
must be employed in bringing them to market.  <i>At a
coal-mine for which the landlord can get no rent</i>, but
which he must either work himself, or let it alone all
together, <i>the price of coals must generally be nearly
about this price</i>’” (l.c., pp. 393-95).</p>
<p>Adam Smith is mistaken when he declares the particular
set of circumstances on the market, under which the most
fertile mine (or land) dominates the market, to be the
<i>rule</i>.  But provided such a case is assumed his
reasoning is correct (on the whole) and Ricardo’s
wrong.  Adam Smith presupposes that as a result of the
state of demand and because of its relative superior
fertility, the best mine can only force the whole of its
product on to the market if it undersells its competitors,
if its product is <i>below</i> the old market-value. 
This causes the price to fall for the worse mines too. 
The market-price falls.  This in any case <i>lowers the
rent</i> on worse mines and can even make it disappear
completely.  For the rent is equal to the excess of
market-value over cost-price of the produce, whether that
market-value be like the individual value of the produce of
a certain class [of land], or mines, or not.  What
Smith fails to       
notice, is that the profit can only be diminished by this if
it becomes necessary to withdraw capital and reduce the
scale of production.  If the
market-price—regulated, as it is under the given
circumstances, by the produce of the best mines— falls
so low as to afford no excess above cost-price for the
product of the worst mine, then it can be worked only by its
owner.  At this market-price, no capitalist will pay
him a rent.  His ownership of land does not, in this
case, give him power over capital, but as far as he is
concerned it annuls the resistance which other capitalists
meet who wish to apply capital to land.  Landed
property does <i>not exist</i> for him because he himself is
the landed proprietor.  Hence he can use his land as a
mine, or in any other sphere of production, i.e., he can
employ it if the market-price, which he <i>finds</i>
predetermined and does not determine himself—if the
market-price of the product yields him the average profit,
that is, his <i>cost-price</i>.</p>
<p>And from this Ricardo concludes that Smith contradicts
himself!  Because the old market-price determines how
far new mines can be opened up by their owners—in
other words they can be worked in circumstances where landed
property disappears, since at the old market-price they
yield their cultivators the <i>cost-price</i>—he
concludes that this cost-price determines the
market-price!  But again he takes refuge in the
descending line and allows the less fertile mine to be
cultivated only when the market-price of the product rises
above the value of the product of the better mines, whereas
it is only necessary that it rises <i>above</i> the
cost-price or even that it equals the cost-price in the case
of the worse mines exploited by their proprietors
themselves.  Incidentally, his assumption that
“… if by new processes the quantity” (of
coal) “should be increased, the <i>price would
fall</i>, and <i>some mines would be abandoned</i>”
[l.c., p. 394], depends only on the degree of the fall in
price and the state of demand.  If, with this fall of
prices, the market can absorb the whole product, then the
bad mines will still yield a rent provided the fall of
market-price still leaves an excess of market-value over the
cost-price of the poorer mines, and [the mines will] be
worked by their owners, if the market-value only covers, or
is equal to, the cost-price.  In either case, however,
[it is] absurd to say that the cost-price of the worst mine
regulates the market-price.  Although the cost-price of
the worst mine determines the relation of the price of its
produce to the ruling market-price, and <i>therefore</i>
decides the question whether or not <span class="context">||618|</span> the mine can be worked. 
But the fact that a piece of land or a mine of a particular
degree of fertility can be exploited at a <i>given
market-price</i>, is obviously not related to or identical
with the determination of the market-price by the cost-price
of the produce of these mines.  If an <i>increased
market-value</i> would make an <i>additional supply</i>
necessary or possible then the worst land would regulate the
market-value, but then it would also yield absolute
rent.  This is the exact <i>opposite</i> of the case
assumed by Adam Smith.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Ricardo reproaches Smith for believing (p. 395,
et.  seq.) that cheapness of raw produce, for instance
substitution of potatoes for corn, which would lower the
wage and diminish the cost of production, would cause a
larger share as well as a larger quantity to fall to the
landlord, Ricardo on the other hand [maintains that] :</p>
<p class="quote">“No part of that additional
proportion would go to rent, but the whole invariably to
profits … while lands of the same quality were
cultivated, and there was no alteration in their relative
fertility or advantages, <i>rent would always bear the some
proportion to the gross produce</i>” (l.c.,
p. 396).</p>
<p>This is positively wrong.  The share of rent would
fall and, therefore, its quantity would decrease
<i>relatively</i>.  The introduction of potatoes as the
principal means of subsistence, would reduce the value of
labour-power, shorten the necessary labour-time, increase
the surplus labour-time and therefore the <i>rate</i> of
surplus-value, hence—other circumstances remaining the
same—the composition of the capital would be altered,
the value of the variable part would diminish in comparison
with that of the constant part, although the <i>quantity</i>
of living labour employed remained the same.  The
<i>rate of profit</i> would therefore rise.  In this
case [there would be] a fall in absolute rent and
proportionately in differential rent.  (See page 610
Table C.)  This factor would affect equally
agricultural and non-agricultural capital.  The general
rate of profit would rise and the rent would
<i>consequently</i> fall.</p>
<p><i>Chapter XXVIII.  “On the comparative Value
of Gold, Corn, and Labour, in Rich and Poor
Countries</i>.”</p>
<p class="quote">“Dr. Smith’s error, throughout his
whole work, lies in supposing that the value of corn is
constant; that though the value of all other things may, the
value of corn never can be raised.  Corn, according to
him, is always of the same value because it will always feed
the same number <i>of</i> people.  In the same manner,
it might be said, that cloth is always of the same value,
because it will always make the same number of coats. 
What can value have to do with the power of feeding and
clothing?” (l.c., pp. 449-50.)</p>
<p class="quote">“Dr. Smith … has so ably
supported the doctrine of the natural price of commodities
ultimately regulating their market-price   
(l.c., p. 451).</p>
<p class="quote">“Estimated in corn, gold may be of
very different value in two countries.  I have
endeavoured to shew that it will he low in rich countries,
and high in poor countries; Adam Smith is of a different
opinion: he thinks that the value of gold, estimated in
corn, is highest in rich countries” (l.c.,
p. 454).</p>
<p><i>Chapter XXXII.  “Mr. Malthus’s Opinions on
Rent</i>.”</p>
<p class="quote">“Rent is a creation of value …
but not a creation of wealth” (l.c., p. 
485).</p>
<p class="quote">“In speaking of the high price of
corn, Mr. Malthus evidently does not mean the price per
quarter or per bushel, but rather the excess of price for
which the whole produce will sell, above the cost of its
production, including always in the term “cost of its
production”, profits as well as wages.  One
hundred and fifty quarters of corn at £3 10s. per
quarter, would yield a larger rent to the landlord than 100
quarters at £4, provided the cost of production were
in both cases the same” (l.c., p. 487). 
“Whatever the nature of the land may be, high rent
must depend on the high price of the produce; but, given the
high price, rent must be high in proportion to abundance and
not to scarcity” (l.c., p. 492).</p>
<p class="quote">“As rent is the effect of the high
price of corn, the loss of rent is the effect of a low
price.  Foreign corn never enters into competition with
such home corn as affords a rent; the fall of price
invariably affects the landlord till the whole of his rent
is absorbed;—if it fall still more, the price will not
afford even the common profits of stock; capital will then
quit the land for some other employment, and the corn, which
was before grown upon it, will then, and not till then, be
imported.  From the loss of rent, there will be a loss
of value, of estimated money value, but, there will be a
gain of wealth.  The amount of the raw produce and
other productions together will be increased; from the
greater facility with which they are produced, they will,
though augmented in quantity, he diminished in value”
(l.c., p. 519).</p>

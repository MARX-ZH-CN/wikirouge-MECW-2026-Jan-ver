<h1>[Chapter XXII]  Ramsay</h1>
<h3>[1.  The Attempt to Distinguish Between Constant
and Variable Capital.  The View that Capital Is Not an
Essential Social Form]</h3>
<p><span class="context">||XVIII-086|</span> <a id="tsv3p326">Ramsay</a>, George
(of Trinity College, Cambridge), <i>An Essay on the
Distribution of Wealth</i>, Edinburgh, 1836.</p>
<p>With Ramsay we return again to the political
economists.</p>
<p>&lt;In order to find a place for commercial capital, he
calls it “the transport of commodities from one place
to another” (op.  cit., p. 19).  He thus
confuses trade with the carrying industry.&gt;</p>
<p>Ramsay’s chief contribution:</p>
<p><i>First:</i> That he does in fact make the distinction
between <i>constant and variable capital</i>.  True,
this occurs in such a manner, that the distinction between
fixed and circulating capital which he takes from the
circulation process is the only one which he
<i>nominally</i> retains, but he defines fixed capital in
such a way that it includes all the elements of constant
capital.  He therefore regards as <i>fixed</i> capital
not only machinery and instruments, buildings in which
labour is carried on or in which the results of labour are
stored, draught and breeding animals, but also all raw
materials (semi-manufactures, etc.)  “the seed of
the agriculturist, and the raw material of the
manufacturer” (op. cit., p. 22).  Moreover
“manure of all kinds, fences […] for
agriculture, and the fuel consumed in manufactories”
(loc. cit., p. 23) are fixed capital.</p>
<p class="quote">“<i>Circulating capital</i> consists
exclusively of subsistence and other necessaries advanced to
the workmen, previous to the completion of the produce of
their labour” (loc. cit., p. 23).</p>
<p>It can be seen therefore that by “circulating
capital” he understands nothing <span class="context">||1087|</span> but that part of capital
which constitutes wages, and by fixed capital, that part
which constitutes the objective conditions—means and
materials—of labour.


<p><a id="tsv3p327">The</a> mistake here, however, is the identification of this
division of capital, which is directly derived from the
production process, with the distinction which arises from
the circulation process.  This is due to his adherence
to the economic tradition.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ramsay again confuses the purely
material element of the fixed capital thus defined with its
existence as “capital”.  Circulating capital
(i.e., variable capital) does not enter into the real labour
process, but what does enter, is living labour, which is
bought with circulating capital, and which replaces
it.  What enters in addition into the labour process is
constant capital, that is, labour embodied in the objective
conditions of labour, in the materials and means of
labour.  Ramsay therefore writes:</p>
<p class="quote">“… fixed capital alone, not
circulating, is properly speaking a source of national
wealth” (loc. cit., p. 23). 
“…labour and fixed capital are the only
elements of expense of production” (op. cit.,
p. 28).</p>
<p>What is really expended in the production of a commodity
are raw materials, machinery, etc., and the living labour
which sets them in motion.</p>
<p class="quote">“Circulating” capital is
superfluous, extraneous to the process of production.</p>
<p class="quote">“… were we to suppose the
labourers not to be paid until the completion of the
product, there would be no occasion whatever for circulating
capital.  […] industry would be carried on on a
scale quite as great<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[a]</a>
[…] Nothing can prove more strongly<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[b]</a> that circulating capital is not an
<i>immediate</i> agent in<a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">[c]</a> production, <i>nor even essential to
it at all</i>, but merely a <i>convenience rendered
necessary by the deplorable poverty of the mass of the
people</i>” (op.  cit., p. 24).</p>
<p class="quote">“…fixed capital […]
alone constitutes an element of cost of production in a
national point of view”… (loc. cit.,
p. 26).</p>
<p>In other words: the labour materialised in the conditions
of labour—materials and means of labour—which we
call “fixed capital”, and the living labour, in
short, embodied, materialised labour and living labour, are
necessary conditions of production, elements of the national
wealth.  On the other hand, [according to Ramsay], it
is a mere “convenience” due to the
“deplorable poverty of the mass of the people”
that the means of subsistence of the workers at all assume
the form of “circulating capital”.  Labour
is a condition of production, but wage-labour
<a id="tsv3p328">is</a> not, and neither, therefore, is it necessary
that the workers’ means of subsistence confront them as
“capital”, as an “advance by the
capitalist”.  What Ramsay overlooks is that if
the means of subsistence of the workers did not confront
them as “capital” (as “circulating
capital”, as he calls it), neither would the objective
conditions of labour confront them as “capital”,
as “fixed capital”, as he calls it.  Ramsay
attempts in earnest, and not merely in words as the other
economists do, to reduce capital to “a portion of the
national wealth, employed, or meant to be employed, in
favouring reproduction” (op. cit., p. 21); he
therefore declares wage-labour and consequently
capital—that is the <i>social form which the means of
reproduction assume on the basis of wage-labour—to</i>
be unimportant and due merely to the poverty of the mass of
the people.</p>
<p>Thus we have arrived at the point where political economy
itself—on the basis of its analysis—declares the
<i>capitalist form</i> of production, and consequently
<i>capital</i>, to be not an absolute, but merely an
“accidental”, historical condition of
production.</p>
<p>Ramsay’s analysis, however, does not go far enough to
draw the correct conclusions from his premises, from the new
definition which he has given to capital in the immediate
production process.</p>
<h3>[2.  Ramsay’s Views on Surplus-Value and on
Value.  Reduction of Surplus-Value to Profit.  The
Influence Which Changes in the Value of Constant and
Variable Capital Exert on the Rate and Amount of
Profit]</h3>
<p>Ramsay comes indeed close to the correct definition of
surplus-value.</p>
<p class="quote">“… a circulating capital will
always maintain more labour than that formerly bestowed upon
itself.  Because, could it employ no more than had been
previously bestowed upon itself, what advantage could arise
to the owner from the use of it as such?” (op. cit.,
p. 49).  “There is no possible way of escaping
this conclusion, except by asserting<a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4">[d]</a> that the <i>quantity of labour</i>
which any circulating capital will employ is no more than
equal to <i>that previously bestowed</i> upon it. 
[… ] This would be [… ] to say, that
the value of the capital expended is<a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5">[e]</a> equal to that of the product”
(loc. cit., p. 52).


<p><a id="tsv3p329">This</a> means, therefore, that the capitalist exchanges less
materialised labour for more living labour and that this
surplus of unpaid living labour constitutes the excess of
the value of the product over the value of the capital
consumed in its production, in other words, the
<i>surplus-value</i> (profit, etc.).  If the amount of
labour for which the capitalist pays wages were equal to the
amount which he receives back from the worker in the
product, then the value of the product would be no greater
than that of the capital and there would be no profit. 
Although Ramsay is very close here to the real origin of
surplus-value, he is nevertheless too bound up in the
tradition of the economists not to begin immediately
straying again along false paths.  First of all, the
way he explains this exchange between variable capital <span class="context">||1088|</span> and labour is
ambiguous.  If he had been quite clear about this, then
further misunderstanding would have been impossible. 
He says:</p>
<p class="quote">“… circulating capital”,
for instance, “raised by the labour of 100 men, will
[…] employ a greater number, say 150.<a href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6">[f]</a>  Therefore the product at the
end of the […] year, will, in this case, be the
result of the labour of 150 men” (loc. cit.,
p. 50).</p>
<p>Under what circumstances can the product of 100 men buy
[the labour of] 150 men?</p>
<p>If the wages received by a worker for 12 hours’ labour
were equal to the value of 12 hours’ labour, then only one
working-day could be bought back with the product of his
labour and only 100 working-days with the product of 100
working-days.  But if the value of the daily product of
his labour is equal to 12 labour hours and the value of the
daily wage he receives is equal to 8 labour hours, then 1
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">2</sub> working-days or the labour of
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">2</sub> men can be paid for, bought back,
for the value of his daily product.  And 100
(1+<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">2</sub> men or working-days) = 100+50
or 150 men can be employed with the product of 100
working-days.  Thus, the condition in which the product
of 100 men sets 150 in motion is that each of the 100 men
and, in general, every worker, spends half as much time
working gratis for the capitalist as he works for himself,
or that he spends a third of the working-day working
gratis.  Ramsay does not make this clear.  The
ambiguity appears in the conclusion: “Therefore the
product at the end of the … year, will, in this case,
be the result of the labour of 150 men” [loc. cit.,
p. 50].  It will indeed be
<a id="tsv3p330">the</a> result of the labour of 150 men in the same way as
the product of 100 men was the result of the labour of 100
men.  The ambiguity (and certainly the lack of clarity,
more or less derived from Malthus) is to be found in this:
It appears as if the profit arises merely from the fact that
150 men are now employed instead of 100.  Just as if
the profit derived from the 150 workers arose from the fact
that 225 workers can now be set in motion by the product of
the 150 [in the ratio of] 100:150= 150:225 [or] 20:30=30:45
[or] 4:6=6:9.  But that is not the point.</p>
<p>The labour which the 100 men supply amounts to x, if x
equals their total working-day.  The wages they receive
will then equal <i><sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>x</i>. 
Hence the value of their product equals x, the value of
their wages equals x–<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>x, and
the surplus-value made on them is
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>x.</p>
<p>If the entire product of the labour of 100 men is again
laid out in wages, then 150 men can be employed with it and
their product will be equal to the wages of 225 men. 
The labour-time of 100 men is the labour-time of 100
men.  But the labour they are <i>paid for</i> is the
product of 66 <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> men, that is, only
<sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> of the value embodied in their
product.  The ambiguity [arises] because it appears as
if the 100 men or the 100 working-days (it makes no
difference whether they are days calculated over a year or
separate days) produce 150 working-days—a product
embodying the value of 150 working-days; while, conversely,
the value of 100 working-days suffices to <i>pay for</i> 150
working-days.  If the capitalist continues to employ
100 men as he did previously, then his profit remains the
same.  He will continue to pay the 100 men a product
equal to the labour-time of 66 <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> men
and pocket the rest as he did before.  If, on the other
hand, he bays out the whole product of the 100 men in wages
once again, then he <i>accumulates</i> and appropriates a
new amount of surplus labour equal to 50 working-days
instead of only 33 <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> as he did
previously.</p>
<p>It is immediately apparent that Ramsay is not clear on
the point, since he once again advances against the
determination of value by labour-time the otherwise
“inexplicable” phenomenon that the <i>rates of
profit</i> are equal for capitals which exploit different
masses of labour-power.</p>
<p class="quote">“The use of fixed capital modifies to
a considerable extent the principle that value depends upon
quantity of labour.  For some commodities on which the
same quantity of labour has been expended, require very
different
<a id="tsv3p331">periods</a> before they are fit for consumption. 
But as during this time the capital brings no return, <i>in
order that the employment in question should not be less
lucrative than others</i> in which the product is sooner
ready for use, it is necessary that the commodity, when at
last brought to market, <i>should be increased in value by
all the amount of the profit withheld</i>.  This shews
[…] how capital may regulate value independently of
labour” (op. cit., p. 43).</p>
<p>It shows rather that capital regulates average prices
independently <i>of the value</i> of the particular product
and that it exchanges commodities not according to their
value, but in such a way that one employment of capital
“should not be less <span class="context">||1089|</span> lucrative than
others”.  Since empty tradition is more powerful
in political economy than in any other science, Ramsay does
not fail either to reproduce the “wine in the
cellar”<a href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7">[g]</a>
argument which has been notorious since the time of [James]
Mill.  And he therefore concludes that “capital
is a source of value independent of labour” (op. cit.,
p. 55), whereas the most he would have been justified in
concluding was that the surplus-value realised by capital in
a particular branch of production does not depend on the
quantity of labour employed by that particular
capital.  <span class="context">|1089||</span></p>
<p><span class="context">||1090|</span> This false
conception of Ramsay’s in this case is all the more
surprising since, on the one hand, he grasps <i>the natural
basis</i>, so to speak, of surplus-value, and, on the other
hand, he affirms with regard to one instance that the
<i>distribution of surplus-value—its</i> equalisation
to the general rate of profit—does not increase the
surplus-value itself.</p>
<p>[Ramsay says <i>firstly:</i>]</p>
<p class="quote">“… profits owe their existence
to a<a href="#_ftn8" id="_ftnref8">[h]</a> law of the
material world, whereby the beneficence of nature when aided
and directed by the labour and skill of man, gives so ample
a return to national industry as to leave a <i>surplus</i>
of products over and above what is absolutely necessary for
replacing in kind the fixed capital consumed, and <i>for
perpetuating the race of labourers employed</i>”
[op. cit., p. 205].</p>
<p>&lt;“<i>Perpetuating</i> the race of
labourers” <span class="context">||1091|</span> is a
fine result of capitalist production.  Of course, if
labour only sufficed to reproduce the conditions of labour
and to keep the workers alive, no <i>surplus</i> would be
possible, hence no profit and no capital.  But that
nature has nothing whatever to do with it and
<a id="tsv3p332">that</a> the race of labourers perpetuates itself despite
this <i>surplus</i> and that the surplus assumes the form of
profit and on this basis, the race of capitalists
perpetuates itself has been admitted by Ramsay himself since
he declares that “circulating capital”, by which
he means wages, wage-labour, is not an essential condition
of production, but is due merely to the “deplorable
poverty of the mass of the people”.  He does not
draw the conclusion that it is capitalist production which
“perpetuates” this “deplorable
poverty”, although he admits it when he says that it
“perpetuates the race of labourers” and leaves
them only as much as is necessary for that
perpetuation.  In the sense indicated above it can be
said that surplus-value etc. rests on a <i>natural law</i>,
that is, on the productivity of human labour in its exchange
with nature.  But Ramsay himself states that a source
of surplus-value is the <i>absolute lengthening of
labour-time</i> (p. 102) as well as the increased
productivity of labour brought about by industry.&gt;</p>
<p class="quote">“… let the gross produce be
ever so little more than is strictly essential for the above
purposes, and the separation of a distinct revenue from the
general mass, under the appellation of profit, and belonging
to another class of men, becomes possible” (loc. cit.,
p. 205).  “… <i>the very existence of the
former<a href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9">[i]</a> as a
distinct class is dependent on the productiveness of
industry</i>” (loc.  cit., p. 206).</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, with regard to the equalisation of the
rate of profit as a result of the rise in prices in some
branches caused by increases in wages, Ramsay observes:</p>
<p>The rise in prices in some branches of industry resulting
from increases in wages “… by no means exempted
the master-capitalists from suffering in their profits, nor
even <i>at all diminished their total loss</i>, but only
served <i>to distribute it more equally among the different
orders composing that body</i>” (op.  cit.,
p. 163).</p>
<p>And if the capitalist whose wine is the product of 100
men (Ramsay’s example) sells it for the same price as a
capitalist whose commodity is the product of 150 men, in
order that “… the employment [of capital] in
question should not be less lucrative than others”
[p. 43], then it is clear that thereby the surplus-value
embodied in the wine and in the other commodity is not
increased, but only distributed equally between different
orders of capitalists <span class="context">|1091||</span>.</p>
<p><span class="context">||1089|</span> He also brings up
again Ricardo’s exceptions [to the
<a id="tsv3p333">determination</a> of value by labour-time].  These
latter will have to be discussed in that part of <i>our</i>
text where we speak of the conversion of value into <i>price
of production</i>.  That is, very briefly, as
follows.  Provided that in the different branches of
production the length of the working—day (insofar as
this is not compensated by the intensity of labour, the
unpleasantness of the work, etc.) is the same, or rather the
surplus labour is the same [as well as] the rate of
exploitation, the rate of surplus-value can change only if
wages rise or fall.  Such variations in the rate of
surplus-value, like the rise or fall in wages, will affect
the production prices of commodities in different ways
according to the organic composition of capital. 
Capital in which the variable part is large compared to the
constant part, would acquire more surplus labour as a result
of a fall in wages and would appropriate less surplus labour
as a result of a rise in wages than capital with a larger
proportion of the constant part to the variable part. 
A rise or fall in wages would therefore have opposite
effects on the rate of profit in the two branches or on the
general rate of profit.  In order to maintain the
general rate of profit, if wages rise, the prices of the
first kind of commodities will rise, and those of the second
kind will fall.  (Either type of capital will of course
be <i>directly</i> affected by variations in wages only in
proportion to the greater or less quantity of living labour
it employs in comparison with the total capital
expended.)  Conversely, if wages fall, the prices of
the first kind of commodities will fall and those of the
second kind will rise.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, all this hardly belongs to the
discussion of the original conversion of values into
production prices and the original establishment of the
general rate of profit, since it is much more a question of
how a <i>general rise or fall in wages</i> will affect
production prices regulated by the general rate of
profit.</p>
<p>This problem has even less to do with the difference
between fixed and circulating capital.  Bankers and
merchants employ almost exclusively circulating capital and
hardly any variable capital; that is, they lay out
relatively small amounts of capital on living labour. 
Contrariwise, a mine-owner employs incomparably more fixed
capital than a capitalist engaged in tailoring.  But it
is very questionable whether he employs relatively as much
living labour.  It is merely because Ricardo advanced
this special, relatively insignificant case as the <i>only
instance of a divergence</i> between production price and
value (or, as he incorrectly put it, [as] an exception to
the determination
<a id="tsv3p334">of</a> value by labour-time) and presented it in the form of
a difference between fixed and circulating capital, that
this blunder—and in an incorrect form at
that—has survived as an important dogma in all
subsequent political economy.  (The mine-owner should
be counterposed not to the tailor but to the banker and the
merchant.)</p>
<p>[Ramsay writes:]</p>
<p class="quote">“… the rise of wages […] is limited by the productiveness of industry.  In
other words, … a man can never receive more for the
labour of a day or year than with the aid of all the other
sources of wealth, he can produce in the same time. 
… his pay must be less than this, for a <i>portion of
the gross produce</i> always goes to replace fixed
capital” (i.e., <i>constant capitol</i>, raw materials
and machinery, according to Ramsay) “with its
profit” (op. cit., p. 119).</p>
<p>Here Ramsay confuses two things.  The amount of
“fixed capital” embodied in the daily product is
not the product of the day’s labour of the worker; in other
words, this portion of the <i>value</i> of the product
represented by a portion of the product in kind is not the
product of this day’s labour.  On the other hand,
profit is indeed a deduction from the daily product of the
worker or from the value of this daily product.</p>
<p>Although Ramsay has not clearly elaborated the nature of
surplus-value and although in particular he remains firmly
rooted in the old prejudices with regard to the relation of
value and production price and the conversion of
surplus-value into average profit, he has on the other hand
drawn another, correct <span class="context">||1090|</span>
conclusion from his conception of fixed and circulating
capital.</p>
<p>Before coming to this, [here is another passage
about “value”]:</p>
<p class="quote">“… <i>value</i> must be in
proportion not merely to the capital truly consumed, but to
that also which continues unaltered, in a word,<a href="#_ftn10" id="_ftnref10">[j]</a> to the total capital
employed” (op. cit., p. 74).</p>
<p>By this he means that profit, and therefore also the
production price, must be in proportion [to the total
capital employed] whereas the value obviously cannot be
altered by that part of the capital which does not enter
into the value of the product.</p>
<p>[Ramsay drew the following conclusion from his conception
of fixed and circulating capital.]


<p><a id="tsv3p335">With</a> the advance of society (i.e., of capitalist
production) the fixed portion of capital increases at the
expense of the circulating capital, i.e., that laid out in
labour.  Therefore the demand for labour declines
<i>relatively</i> as wealth increases or capital is
accumulated.  In manufacture, the “evils”
which the development of the productive forces generate for
the workers are temporary, but reappear constantly.  In
agriculture, they are continuous, especially in connection
with the conversion of arable land into pasture.  The
general result is: with the advance of society, i.e., with
the development of capital, here with that of national
wealth, the condition of the workers is affected less and
less by this development, in other words, it <i>worsens</i>
relatively in the same ratio as the general wealth
increases, i.e., as capital is accumulated, or, what amounts
to the same thing, as the scale of reproduction
increases.  One can see that it is a far cry from this
conclusion to the naive conceptions of Adam Smith or the
apologetics of vulgar political economy.  For Adam
Smith, the accumulation of capital is identical with growing
demand for labour, continual rise of wages, and
<i>consequently</i> with a fall of profits.  In his
time, the demand for labour did in fact grow at least in the
same proportion in which capital was accumulated, because
manufacture still predominated at that time and large-scale
industry was only in its infancy.</p>
<p>[Ramsay says:]</p>
<p class="quote">“… that demand<a href="#_ftn11" id="_ftnref11">[k]</a> must depend”
(directly, immediately) “upon the amount of the latter
species of capital alone”<a href="#_ftn12" id="_ftnref12">[l]</a> (op. cit., p. 87).  (This is
tautology on Ramsay’s part, since he equates circulating
capital with capital laid out in wages.)  “At
every change of this kind,<a href="#_ftn13" id="_ftnref13">[m]</a> the fixed capital of the country is
increased at the expense of the circulating”
(loc. cit., p. 89).  “… the demand for
labour will generally increase as capital augments, still it
by no means follows that it will do so in the same
proportion”<a href="#_ftn14" id="_ftnref14">[n]</a>
(loc. cit., p. 88).  “It is not, until, in the
progress of industry, favoured by the new inventions,
circulating capital shall have become increased beyond what
it formerly was,”</p>
<p>&lt;here again the wrong assumption creeps in that an
increase of necessaries in general and increase of that
portion of necessaries intended for the workers are the same
thing&gt;</p>
<p class="quote">“<a id="tsv3p336">that</a> a greater demand for labour
will spring up.  Demand will then rise, but not in
proportion to the accumulation of the general capital. 
In countries where industry has much advanced, fixed capital
comes gradually to bear a greater and greater proportion to
circulating.  <i>Every augmentation, therefore, in the
national stock destined for reproduction, comes, in the
progress of society, to hove a less and less influence upon
the condition of the labourer</i>” (loc.  cit.,
pp. 90-91).  “Every addition to fixed capital, is
made […] at the expense of the circulating”,
i.e., at the expense of the demand for labour (loc. cit.,
p. 91).</p>
<p class="quote">“The evils resulting from the
invention of machinery, to the labouring population employed
in the latter,<a href="#_ftn15" id="_ftnref15">[o]</a>
will probably be but temporary, <i>liable to be perpetually
renewed however</i>, as fresh improvements are constantly
making for economising labour” [loc. cit., p. 91].</p>
<p>And for the following reasons.  [<i>Firstly:</i>]
The capitalists who use the <i>new machinery</i> obtain
extraordinary profits; consequently their capacity to save
and to increase their capital grows.  A portion of this
is also used as circulating capital.  Secondly, the
price of the manufactured commodities falls in proportion to
the diminished cost of production; thus the consumers save,
and this facilitates the accumulation of capital, a portion
of which may find its way to the manufacturing industry in
question.  Thirdly: the fall in the price of these
products increases the demand for them.</p>
<p class="quote">“Thus […] though […]
it<a href="#_ftn16" id="_ftnref16">[p]</a> may throw out
of employment a considerable body of persons,
“this” will yet probably be followed, after a
longer or shorter period, by the re-engagement of the same,
or even a much greater number of labourers”
(loc. cit., pp. 92-93).</p>
<p class="quote">“… in agriculture the case is
widely different.  The demand for raw produce cannot
increase in that rapid way in which it may for manufactured
goods…  But the change of all others most
fatal<a href="#_ftn17" id="_ftnref17">[q]</a> to the
country people is the conversion of arable land into
pasture…  Almost all the funds which formerly
supported men, are now vested in cattle, sheep and other
elements of fixed capital” (loc. cit., p. 93). 
<span class="context">|1090||</span></p>
<p><span class="context">||1091|</span> Ramsay remarks
correctly:</p>
<p class="quote">“<i>Wages</i> … as well as
<i>profits</i>, are to be considered each of them as really
a <i>portion of the finished product</i>, totally distinct
in the national point of view from the cost of raising
it” (op. cit., p. 142).</p>
<p class="quote">“Independent of its results,
it” (fixed capital) “is a pure
loss…  But, besides this, labour … not
what is paid for it, ought to be reckoned as<a href="#_ftn18" id="_ftnref18">[r]</a>
<a id="tsv3p337">another</a> element of cost of production, Labour is
[…] a sacrifice […] The more of it is expended
in one employment, the less … for another, and
therefore if<a href="#_ftn19" id="_ftnref19">[s]</a>
applied to unprofitable undertakings … the nation
suffers from the waste of the principal source of
wealth…  the <i>reward of labour</i> ought not
to be considered as<a href="#_ftn20" id="_ftnref20">[t]</a> an element of cost” … (loc. cit.,
pp. 142-43).</p>
<p>(This is quite right: <i>labour</i>, and not <i>paid</i>
labour or wages, must be considered as an element of
value.)</p>
<p>Ramsay describes the <i>real</i> reproduction process
correctly:</p>
<p class="quote">“In what manner is a comparison to be
instituted between<a href="#_ftn21" id="_ftnref21">[u]</a>
the product and the stock expended upon it?… With
regard to a whole nation…  It is evident that
<i>all the various elements of the stock expended</i> must
be <i>reproduced</i> in some employment or another,
otherwise the industry of the country could not go on as
formerly.  The raw material of manufactures, the
implements used in them, as also in agriculture, the
extensive machinery engaged in the former, the buildings
necessary for fabricating or storing the produce, must all
be parts of the total return of a country, as well as of the
advances of all its master-capitalists.  Therefore, the
quantity of the former may be compared with that of the
latter, each article being supposed placed as it were beside
that of a similar kind” (loc. cit., pp. 137-39).</p>
<p class="quote">As regards the individual capitalist</p>
<p>&lt;this is a false abstraction.  The nation does
not exist, or exists only as the capitalist class, and the
whole class operates in exactly the same way as the
individual capitalist.  The two methods of approach
differ from one another only in that one clings to and
isolates use-value, the other exchange-value&gt;</p>
<p class="quote">since the stock expended by him is not
<i>replaced</i> in kind, because “the greater number
[of its elements] must be obtained by exchange, a certain
portion of the product being necessary for this
purpose.  Hence each individual master-capitalist comes
to look much more to the exchangeable value of his product
than to its quantity” (loc. cit., pp. 145-46).<a href="#_ftn22" id="_ftnref22">[v]</a></p>
<p class="quote"><span class="context">||1092|</span>
“… the more the <i>value of the</i><a href="#_ftn23" id="_ftnref23">[w]</a> <i>product exceeds
the value of the capital advanced, the greater will be his
profit</i>.  Thus, then, will he estimate it, by
comparing value with value, not quantity with
quantity.  This is the first difference to be remarked
in the mode of reckoning profits between nations and
individuals” (loc. cit., p. 146).</p>
<p>&lt;The nation too—if it is not supposed to be
identical with the body of capitalists—can so far
compare value with value.  It can calculate the total
labour-time which it has to expend to replace the used-up
part of its constant capital and the part
<a id="tsv3p338">of</a> the product consumed individually, and the time of
labour spent in producing a surplus designed to enlarge the
scale of reproduction.&gt;</p>
<p class="quote">“The second is, that, since the
master-capitalist always makes an advance <i>of wages</i> to
the labourers, <i>instead of paying them out of the finished
commodity</i>, he considers this as well as the fixed
capital consumed, a part of his expenses, though […]
nationally speaking, it is not<a href="#_ftn24" id="_ftnref24">[x]</a> an element of cost”
(loc. cit., p. 146).</p>
<p>&lt;This difference too disappears in fact in the
process of reproduction as a whole.  The capitalist
always pays <i>out of the finished commodity</i>, that is to
say, out of the commodity finished by the labourer yesterday
he pays his wages tomorrow, or in point of fact, he gives
him, in the form of wages, only an assignation of products
to <i>be finished in future</i> or <i>almost produced,
i.e</i>., finally produced by the time they are
bought.  The <i>advance</i> disappears as a mere
illusion in reproduction, i.e., in the continuity of the
process of production.&gt;</p>
<p class="quote">“Hence his rate of profit will depend
upon the excess in the value of his product over and above
the value of the capital advanced, both fixed and
circulating” (loc.  cit., p. 146).</p>
<p>&lt;This is likewise true in a “national point of
view”.  His profit always depends on what he
himself pays for the product, whether finished or not, when
he pays wages.&gt;</p>
<p>Ramsay has the merit, firstly, that he contradicts the
false notion—current since Adam Smith—of the
value of the whole product dissolving into revenue under
different names; secondly, that he defines the rate of
profit in two ways, [once] by the rate of wages, i.e., the
rate of surplus-value, and a second time, by the value of
the constant capital.  But he transgresses in the
opposite direction to Ricardo.  Ricardo arbitrarily
seeks to equalise the rate of profit and the rate of
surplus-value.  On the other hand, the twofold
determination of the rate of profit—1) by the rate of
surplus-value (hence by the rate of wages) and 2) by the
ratio of this surplus-value to the total capital advanced,
that is, in fact determined by the ratio of the constant
capital to the total capital—is irrationally presented
by Ramsay as two parallel circumstances which determine the
rate of profit.  He does not grasp the transformation
which surplus-value undergoes before it becomes
profit.  Whereas therefore Ricardo arbitrarily
<a id="tsv3p339">seeks</a> to reduce the rate of profit to the rate of
surplus-value in order to work out the theory of value
consistently, Ramsay seeks to reduce surplus-value to
profit.  We shall see later that the way he describes
the influence of the value of constant capital on the rate
of profit is very inadequate, and even incorrect.</p>
<p>[Ramsay writes:]</p>
<p class="quote">“Profit […] must rise or fall
exactly as the <i>proportion</i> of the gross produce, or of
<i>its value</i>, required to replace necessary advances,
falls or rises…  Therefore, the rate of profit
must depend […] upon two circumstances; first, the
proportion of the whole produce which goes to the labourers;
secondly, the proportion which must be set apart for
replacing, <i>either in kind or by exchange</i>, the fixed
capital” (loc. cit., pp. 147-48).</p>
<p>In other words, therefore, the rate of profit depends on
the excess of the value of the product over the sum of
circulating and fixed capital; hence on the proportion
which, firstly, the circulating capital, and, secondly, the
fixed capital bear to the value of the whole produce. 
If we know where this <i>surplus</i> comes from, then the
whole matter is very simple.  But if we only know that
the profit depends on the <i>ratio</i> of the surplus to
these outlays, then we can acquire the most inaccurate
notions about the origin of this surplus, for example we
can, like Ramsay, imagine that it originates in part in
fixed (constant) capital.</p>
<p class="quote"><span class="context">||1093|</span> “To me it
seems certain,<a href="#_ftn25" id="_ftnref25">[y]</a>
that an increased facility of raising the various objects
which enter into the composition of fixed capital, tends, by
diminishing this proportion,<a href="#_ftn26" id="_ftnref26">[z]</a> to raise the rate of profit, just
as in the former case of an augmented return of the elements
of circulating capital, which serves to maintain
labour” (op.  cit., p. 164).</p>
<p>With regard to the tenant farmer, for example:</p>
<p class="quote">“… be the [amount of gross]
return small or great, the quantity of it required for
replacing what has been consumed in these different forms,
can undergo no alteration whatsoever, This quantity must be
considered as <i>constant, so long as production is carried
on on the some scale</i>.  Consequently, <i>the larger
the total return</i>, the less must be the proportion of the
whole which the farmer must set aside for the above
purposes” (loc. cit., p.  166).</p>
<p class="quote">The more easily the farmer who produces food and raw
materials such as flax, hemp, wood, can reproduce them, [the
more] his profit will increase.<a href="#_ftn27" id="_ftnref27">[aa]</a></p>
<p class="quote">The farmer’s profit [increases] as a result of the
<i>increase in the quantity</i> of his produce, <i>the total
value of which remains the same</i>, but “a
smaller
<a id="tsv3p340">proportion</a> of this sum total, and consequently of its
value, is required for restoring the various elements of
fixed capital, with which <i>the farmer can supply
himself;</i>” while the manufacturer would benefit
because his product would have a greater purchasing power
(loc. cit., pp. 166-67).</p>
<p>Let us assume that the harvest amounts to 100 quarters
and the seed corn to 20, that is, a fifth of the
harvest.  Let us assume further that the harvest is
doubled the following year (with the expenditure of the same
amount of labour) and now comes to 200 quarters.  If
the scale of production remains the same, then the amount of
seed corn remains 20 quarters as previously, but this is now
only one-tenth of the harvest.  One has to take into
account however that the value of the 100 quarters
[previously harvested] is equal to that of the 200 quarters
[now obtained], therefore one quarter of the first harvest
is equal to two quarters of the second.  80 quarters
remain over in the first case, 180 in the second. 
Since wages are irrelevant to the present problem, which
concerns the influence that a change in the value of
constant capital exerts on the rate of profit, let us assume
that the value of wages remains unchanged.  Then, if
wages were 20 quarters in the first case, they are 40 in the
second.  Finally, let us assume that the value of the
other ingredients of constant capital which the farmer does
not reproduce in kind amounted to 20 quarters in the first
case and therefore to 40 in the second.</p>
<p>We now have the following calculation:</p>
<p>1) <i>The product</i> amounts to 100 quarters. 
<i>The seed corn</i> to 20 quarters.  <i>The other
elements of constant capital</i> come to 20 quarters,
<i>wages</i> to 20 quarters, <i>profit</i> to 40
quarters.</p>
<p>2) <i>The product</i> amounts to 200 quarters.  The
<i>seed corn</i> to 20 quarters.  <i>The other elements
of constant capital</i> come to 40 quarters, <i>wages</i> to
40 quarters and <i>profit</i> to 100 quarters; i.e., its
value is equal to 50 quarters in the first case.  There
would therefore be a surplus profit of 10 quarters [in the
second case].</p>
<p>Thus not [only] the rate of profit, but also the amount
of profit, would have increased here, as a result of a
change in the value of constant capital.  Although
wages remained the same in both 1 and 2, the ratio of profit
to wages, that is, the rate of surplus-value, would have
risen.  But this is only an illusion.  The profit
would consist firstly of 80 quarters, equal to 40 quarters
in case 1, and the ratio to wages would remain the same;
secondly, [in case] 2, of 20 quarters, equal only to 10
quarters in the first case, which would have been converted
into revenue from constant capital.


<p><a id="tsv3p341">But</a> is this calculation correct?  We must assume
that the result in the second case was due to a successful
harvest which came about although work was carried on in the
same conditions as prevailed in the first case.  In
order to clarify the matter, let us assume that 1 quarter
equals £2 in the first case.  This means that for
the harvest which has yielded him 200 quarters, the farmer
has laid out: 20 quarters for seed corn (or £40), 20
quarters for other elements of constant capital (or
£40), 20 quarters for wages (or £40).  <i>A
total</i> of £120, and the product amounts to 200
quarters.  In the first case he likewise laid out only
£120 (60 quarters) and the product amounting to 100
quarters was worth £200.  The profit remaining
was £80, or 40 quarters.  Since the 200 quarters
[in case 2] are the product of the same amount of labour [as
the 100 quarters in case 1], then once again they are
likewise equal to only £200.  Thus, only
£80 profit remains, which is now, however, equal to
140 quarters.  Consequently, a quarter now [costs the
farmer] only £ <sup class="ratio">4</sup>/<sub class="ratio">7</sub> and not
£1.  In other words, the value of a quarter has
fallen from £2 to £<sup class="ratio">4</sup>/<sub class="ratio">7</sub>,
that is, by £1<sup class="ratio">3</sup>/<sub class="ratio">7</sub>, and not from
[£2] to [£1], that is, by a half as we assumed
above in [case] 2 as opposed to [case] 1.</p>
<p>The farmer’s total product amounts to 200 quarters, that
is, £200.  But £120 out of this £200
replaces the 60 quarters which he has expended, each one of
which cost him £2.  There thus remains a profit
of £80 which is equal to the remaining 140
quarters.  How does this happen?  The quarter is
now worth £1, but each of the 60 quarters expended in
production cost £2.  They cost the farmer as much
as if he had expended 120 of the new quarters.  The
remaining 140 quarters are worth £80, or no more than
the remaining 40 were worth previously.  It is true
that he sells each of the 200 quarters for £1 (if he
sells his total product) and receives £200 for
them.  But of the 200 quarters, 60 have cost him
£2 each, the remaining quarters therefore only yield
him £<sup class="ratio">4</sup>/<sub class="ratio">7</sub> each.</p>
<p>If he now again lays out 20 quarters [for seed] (equal
to £10 [if one reckons 10s.  for a quarter]), 40
quarters for wages (equal to £20), and 40 quarters for
the other elements of constant capital (equal to £20),
that is, a total of 100 quarters instead of 60 as previously
and he harvests 180 quarters, then these 180 quarters have
not the same value as did the 100 previously [if one reckons
£1 for a quarter].  True, he has employed as
much living labour as he did previously, and consequently
the <span class="context">||1094|</span> value of the
variable capital has remained the same and so has
<a id="tsv3p342">the</a> value of the surplus product.  But he has laid
out less materialised labour, since the 20 quarters, which
were worth £20 previously, are now worth only
£10.</p>
<p>The account will therefore work out as follows:</p>

<p>In the first case the product comes to 100 qrs., or
£100.  In the second case the product comes to
180 qrs., or £90.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the rate of profit would have risen [despite
the fall in the value of the product], for in the first case
the return on an outlay of £60 was £40 and in
the second it was £40 for an outlay of
£50.  In the first case it amounted to 66
<sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> per cent, in the second to 80 per
cent.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the rise in the <i>rate of profit</i> is not due
to the <i>value</i> remaining unchanged, as Ramsay
supposes.  Since one part of the labour expended, i.e.,
the part contained in the constant capital (in seeds in this
case), has diminished, the value of the product falls if
<i>production</i> continues on <i>the same scale</i>, just
as the value of 100 lbs. of twist falls if the cotton
it is made of becomes cheaper.  But the ratio of
variable to constant capital increases (without the
<i>value</i> of the variable capital increasing).  In
other words, the ratio of the total capital outlay declines
in relation to the surplus.  Hence the rate of profit
rises.</p>
<p>If what Ramsay says were correct, if the value remained
the same, then the <i>profit</i>, the amount of profit, and
consequently also the rate of profit, would rise. 
There can be no question of a rise merely in the rate of
profit.</p>
<p>The question [of the influence of a change in the value
of constant capital on the rate of profit] is not however
disposed of for the special case [where a part of the
constant capital is replaced in kind].  In agriculture
this special case takes the following form.</p>
<p>A certain amount of seed corn at the <i>old price of the
product</i> figures in the harvest, this part is
incorporated in the harvest in kind.  The other
expenses are defrayed by the sale of the corn at its old
price.  The old outlay yields a product which is twice
as big as before.  Thus, in the above-mentioned case,
for example, where 20 quarters are used as seed corn (equal
to £40) and
<a id="tsv3p343">the</a> other outlays amount to 40 quarters, equalling
£80, the harvest yields 200 quarters and not, as the
previous harvest, 100 quarters (worth £200), of which
40 quarters, equalling £80, were profit on an outlay
of 60 quarters costing £120.  The outlay in
connection with this second harvest is absolutely the same
as it was in the first—60 quarters, the value of which
is £120, but instead of a surplus of 40 quarters, the
surplus is now 140 quarters.  The surplus in kind has
in this case increased considerably.  But because the
labour expended is the same in both cases, the 200 quarters
have no greater value than did the 100, that is,
£200.  In other words the value of the quarter
has fallen from £2 to £1.  But since there
was a surplus of 140 quarters, it seemed that it had to come
to £140, for one quarter is worth just as much as any
other.</p>
<p>The matter would be simplified if we considered it first
of all without regard to the reproduction process, that is
if we assumed that the tenant farmer was withdrawing from
the business and selling his whole product.  Then he
would indeed have to sell 120 quarters to recover his outlay
of £120 (to reimburse himself).  In this way he
would recover his capital outlay.  Thus a surplus of 80
quarters would remain, and not of 140, and since these 80
quarters are equal to £80, they are worth in absolute
terms as much as the surplus in the first case.</p>
<p>In the course of the <i>reproduction</i> process,
however, the matter is altered to a certain extent. 
For the farmer replaces the 20 quarters of seed corn in kind
out of his own product.  [As far as their value is
concerned] they are replaced by 40 quarters in the [new]
product.  But in the reproduction process he only needs
to replace them with 20 quarters in kind, as was the case
previously.  The rest of his expenditure [expressed in
quarters] increases in the same ratio as the quarter is
devalued (provided wages do not fall).  To replace the
remaining portion of constant capital, the farmer now needs
40 quarters and not 20 as previously, and to replace wages
he also needs 40 quarters instead of 20.  Altogether he
must now lay out 100 quarters, compared to 60 quarters
previously; but he need not lay out 120 quarters, the amount
corresponding to the depreciation of the corn, because the
20 quarters used [as seed] which were worth £40, are
replaced by 20 [quarters] (since in this context only their
use-value matters) which are worth [£] 20.  So
evidently he has made a gain <span class="context">||1095|</span> of these 20 qrs., now worth
£20.  His surplus is therefore not £80 but
£100, not 80 qrs., but 100.  (Expressed
<a id="tsv3p344">in</a> quarters of the old value, not 40 quarters but
50.)  This is an unquestionable fact, and if the market
price does not fall as a result of abundance, the farmer can
sell 20 quarters more at the new value, thus gaining
£20.</p>
<p>In the course of <i>reproduction</i>, moreover, the
farmer obtains this surplus of £20 on the same outlay,
because labour has become more productive without the rate
of surplus-value having risen or the workers having
performed more surplus labour than previously or having
received a smaller portion of the <i>reproduced part</i> of
the product (which represents living labour).  On the
contrary, it is assumed that in the reproduction process the
worker receives 40 quarters, whereas he received only 20
previously.  This then is a rather peculiar
phenomenon.  It does not occur without reproduction,
but it takes place in connection with it and it takes place
[moreover] because the farmer replaces a part of his
advances in kind.  Not only the rate of profit could
increase in this case, but the amount of profit as
well.  (With regard to the reproduction process itself,
the farmer can either carry on on the old scale, in which
case the price of the product will fall if he again obtains
as good a harvest, because a portion of the constant capital
has cost less, but the rate of profit will rise; or the
farmer can increase the scale of production, sow more with
the same outlay, and then both the rate of profit and the
amount of profit will rise.)</p>
<p>Let us [now] consider the manufacturer.  Let us
assume that he has laid out £100 in cotton twist and
made a profit of £20.  The product therefore
amounts to £120.  It is assumed that £80
out of the outlay of £100 has been paid for
cotton.  If the price of cotton falls by half, he will
now need to spend only £40 on the cotton and £20
on the rest, that is £60 in all (instead of
£100) and the profit will be £20 as previously,
the total product will amount to £80 (if he does not
increase the scale of his production).  £40 thus
remains in his pocket.  He can either spend it or
invest it as additional capital.  If he invests it, he
will lay out [an additional] £26
<sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> on cotton and £13
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">2</sub> on labour, etc., on the new
scale.  The profit [will amount to] £13
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>.  The total product will now
be 60+40+33 <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>, or £133
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>.</p>
<p>Thus it is not the fact that the farmer replaces his seed
corn in kind which is the key, for the manufacturer buys his
cotton and does not replace it out of his own product. 
What this phenomenon amounts to is this: release of a
portion of the capital previously tied up in constant
capital, or the conversion of a
<a id="tsv3p345">portion</a> of the capital into revenue.  If exactly the
same amount of capital is laid out in the reproduction
process as previously, then it is the same as if additional
capital had been employed on the old scale of
production.  This is therefore a kind of accumulation
which arises from the increased productivity of those
branches of industry which supply the productive ingredients
of capital.  However, such a fall in the [price of] raw
materials, if due to the seasons, is counteracted by
unfavourable seasons, in which the prices of raw materials
rise.  The capital released in this way in one or
several seasons is, therefore, to a certain extent, reserve
capital for the other seasons.  For instance, the
manufacturer whose [fixed capital] turns over once every
twelve years, must arrange things in such a way that he can
continue to produce—at least <i>on the same scale</i>
throughout the twelve years.  One has therefore to take
into account that the <i>prices</i> [of the raw materials]
he has <i>to replace</i> fluctuate and even themselves out
to a certain extent over a long period of years.</p>
<p>A rise in prices of the ingredients [of constant capital]
has the opposite effect to a fall of the prices.  (We
are leaving variable capital out of account here, although
if wages fall, less variable capital—in terms of
value—will need to be laid out, and if they rise
more.)  If production is to be continued on the old
scale, then a greater outlay of capital is necessary. 
Therefore, apart from a fall in the rate of profit, extra
capital must be employed or a part of the revenue must be
converted into capital, although it will not have the effect
of additional capital.</p>
<p><i>Accumulation</i> has taken place in the one case
although the value of the capital advanced has remained the
same (but its material elements have been increased). 
The rate of creating surplus-value increases, and the
absolute magnitude of profit increases, because the effect
is the same as if additional capital had been advanced on
the old scale.  <i>Accumulation</i> has taken place in
the other case insofar as the value of the capital advanced,
i.e., that part of the value of the total output which
functions as capital, has increased, But the material
elements <i>have not been</i> increased.  The rate of
profit falls.  (The amount of profit only falls if
either a different number of workers is employed or if their
wages rise as well.)</p>
<p>This phenomenon of the conversion of capital into revenue
should be noted, because it creates the <i>illusion</i> that
the amount of profit grows (or in the opposite case
decreases) independently of the amount of
surplus-value.  We have seen that, under <span class="context">||1096|</span>
<a id="tsv3p346">certain</a> circumstances, a part of rent can be explained by
this phenomenon.</p>
<p>In the way mentioned above (that is, if the remaining 20
quarters worth £20 are not used immediately to extend
the scale of production, i.e., if they are not accumulated),
a money capital of £20 is set free.  This is an
example of how <i>redundant money capital</i> can be
extracted from the reproduction process although the
aggregate value of commodities remains the same, namely, by
a portion of the capital which existed previously in the
form of fixed (constant) capital being converted into money
capital.</p>
<p>How little the above phenomenon [conversion of a portion
of the capital into revenue] has to do with Ramsay’s
determination of the <i>rate of profit</i>, becomes clear if
one considers the case of a farmer (or manufacturer) who
enters business under the new conditions of
production.  Formerly he needed £120 to enter the
business: £40 to buy 20 quarters of seeds, £40
to buy the other ingredients of constant capital, and
£40 to pay wages.  And his profit was
£80.  80 on 120 is equal to 8 on 12, or 2 on 3,
or 66 <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> per cent.</p>
<p>He now has to advance £20 to buy 20 quarters of
seed, £40 as previously [to buy the other elements of
constant capital], £40 to pay wages, so that his
outlay of capital amounts to £100.  His profit is
[£]80, that is, 80 per cent.  The amount of
profit has remained <i>the same</i>, but the <i>rate</i> of
profit has increased by 20 per cent.  Thus one can see
that the fall in the value of seed (or of the price which
has to be paid to <i>replace</i> the seed) has in itself
nothing to do with the increase in [the amount of] profit,
but implies merely an increase in the rate of profit.</p>
<p>Moreover, the farmer in the one case—or the
manufacturer in the other—will not consider that he
has obtained a larger profit, but that a portion of the
capital previously tied up in production has been
freed.  And his view will be based on the following
simple calculation.  Previously, the amount of capital
advanced in production was £120; now it is £100,
and £20 is now in the hands of the farmer as free
capital, money which can be invested in any way he
likes.  But in either case the capital amounts to
£120 only, its size has therefore not been
increased.  The fact, however, that a sixth of the
capital has been divested of the form in which it is
inseparable from the production process does indeed have the
same <i>effect</i> as an additional investment of
capital.


<p><a id="tsv3p347">Ramsay</a> has not got to the bottom of this matter because
he has not at all clearly worked out the relationship
between value, surplus-value and profit.</p>
<h4>***</h4>
<p>Ramsay correctly expounds to what extent machinery, etc.,
insofar as it affects variable capital, influences profit
and the rate of profit.  That is to say, he shows that
this influence results from the depreciation of
labour-power, the increase of relative surplus labour or, if
the production process is considered as a whole, also the
reduction of the part of the gross return which goes to
replace wages.</p>
<p class="quote">“… an increased or diminished
productiveness of the industry employed in raising
commodities which do not enter into the composition of fixed
capital, can have no influence on the rate of profit, except
by affecting the proportion of the gross amount which goes
to maintain labour” (op. cit., p. 168).</p>
<p class="quote">If<a href="#_ftn28" id="_ftnref28">[bb]</a> the
 manufacturer has doubled his output as a result of
 improvements in machinery, the value of his goods must, in
 the end, fall in the same proportion as their quantity has
 increased.</p>
<p>&lt;It is assumed that in fact, taking the wear and
tear of the machinery into account, twice the quantity costs
no more than half did previously.  If this is not the
case, the value of the commodity falls, but not <i>in
proportion</i> to its quantity.  Its quantity may
double and, whereas the value of the aggregate product
rises, the value of a unit of the commodity, may drop only
from 2 to 1 <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">4</sub>, etc., instead of from
2 to 1.&gt;</p>
<p class="quote">…the manufacturer benefits only insofar as he is
able to clothe the worker more cheaply so that a smaller
portion of the gross return goes to the worker… 
The farmer too benefits &lt;as a result of the increased
industrial productivity&gt; only insofar as n portion of
his outlay is expended on clothing for the labourers and he
can buy this more cheaply now; that is, [he benefits] in the
same way as the manufacturer (loc. cit., pp. 168-69).</p>
<p>A fall [or rise] in the value of the elements of constant
capital affects the rate of profit by altering the <i>ratio
of surplus-value</i>
<a id="tsv3p348">to</a> the total capital outlay.  A fall (or rise) in
wages, on the other hand, affects the rate of profit by
influencing the <i>rate of surplus-value</i> directly.</p>
<p>Supposing for example, that, in the above-mentioned case,
the price of the seed (assuming the farmer grows flax)
remains the same, that is, £40 (20 quarters) and the
rest of the constant capital costs £40 (20 quarters)
as before, but that wages—that is, wages for
<i>the same</i> number of workers—fall from £40
to £20 (from 20 quarters to 10 quarters).  In
this case, the total <i>value</i>, which is equal to the
wages plus surplus-value, remains unchanged.  Since the
number of workers remains the same, their labour is embodied
in a value of £40+£80, i.e., £120, as it
was previously.  But from this £120, £20
now goes to the workers and the surplus-value now amounts to
£100.  &lt;It is assumed that no improvements
have taken place which affect the number of labourers
employed in this branch.&gt;</p>
<p>The capital advanced is now £100 instead of
£120 just as in the case where the value of the seed
fell by half.  But the profit is now £100, i.e.,
100 per cent, whereas in the other case, where the capital
advanced was likewise reduced from £120 to £100,
it was 80 per cent.  And as in that other case
£20, or a sixth of the capital <span class="context">||1097|</span>, is set free.  But in
the former case, the surplus-value remained unchanged—£80—(and since £40 was paid as
wages, [the rate of surplus-value] was 200 per cent). 
In the latter case, the surplus-value rises to £100
(and, since wages now come to £20, [the rate of
surplus-value increases] to 500 per cent).</p>
<p>In this case, not only has the rate of profit risen but
the <i>profit</i> itself, because the rate of surplus-value
has risen and consequently the surplus-value itself. 
This differentiates this case from the other, something
which Ramsay does not grasp.  This always takes place
when the increase in profit is not nullified by a
corresponding reduction in the rate of profit resulting from
a simultaneous change in the value of constant
capital.  In the above-mentioned case for example, the
capital outlay is £120 and the profit £80, that
is, 66 <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> per cent.  In the
present case, the capital outlay is £100 and the
profit £100, which works out at 100 per cent. 
If, however, the capital outlay had risen from £100 to
£150 as a result of a change in the price of constant
capital, then the profit—which has increased from
£80 to £100—would only give a rate of 66
<sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> per cent.</p>
<p>[Ramsay continues]


<p class="quote"><a id="tsv3p349">Because</a> these commodities “help to make up neither
fixed capital nor circulating, it follows that profit can in
no way be affected by any alteration in the facilities for
raising these.  Such are luxuries of all kinds”
(loc. cit., pp.  169-70).</p>
<p class="quote">“Master-capitalists gain by the
abundance” (of luxuries) “because their profits
will command a greater quantity for their private
consumption; but the rate of this profit is in no degree
affected either by their plenty or scarcity”
(loc. cit., p. 171).</p>
<p>First of all, a portion of the luxuries can be used as
one of the elements of constant capital.  Grapes, for
example, in [the production of] wine, gold in luxury
articles, diamonds in glass cutting, etc.  But Ramsay
excludes this case insofar as he says: commodities which do
not enter into fixed capital.  In that case, however,
the concluding sentence—“Such are luxuries of
all kinds”, is incorrect.</p>
<p>However, productivity in the luxury industries can only
increase in the same way as it does in all
others—either because natural resources such as the
land, mines, etc., from which the raw materials for the
luxury industries are procured, become more productive, or
new, more productive sources are discovered; or again by
application of the division of labour, or, especially, by
the use of machinery (or of better tools) and of natural
forces.  &lt;The improvement of tools, as well as the
production of more specialised ones, belongs to the
<i>division of labour</i>.&gt; ( One should not forget
<i>chemical processes</i>.)</p>
<p>Let us now assume that the production time for luxuries
is reduced due to machinery (or chemical processes), that
less labour is required to produce them.  This cannot
have the slightest influence on wages, on the <i>value</i>
of labour-power, since these articles do not enter into the
consumption of the workers (at least never into that part of
their consumption which determines the value of their
labour-power).  (It can influence the <i>market
price</i> of labour, if workers are thrown onto the streets
as a result of these developments and the supply of
labour-power is thereby increased.)  Increased
productivity in the luxury industries, therefore, has no
influence on the rate of surplus-value nor, consequently, on
the rate of profit insofar as this is determined by the rate
of surplus-value.  Nevertheless, it can influence the
rate of profit insofar as it affects either the
<i>amount</i> of surplus-value or the ratio of variable
capital to constant capital and to the total capital.</p>
<p>If for example, [in the production of luxury articles]
machinery makes it possible to employ 10 workers where 20
were
<a id="tsv3p349">previously</a> employed, then, indeed the rate of
surplus-value is not modified in any way.  The
cheapening of luxury articles does not enable the worker to
live more cheaply.  He requires the same amount of
labour-time to reproduce his labour-power as he did
previously.</p>
<p>&lt;In practice, therefore, the manufacturer of luxury
articles seeks to depress the wages of labour below its
value, [below] its minimum.  This he is able to do
because of the <i>relative surplus population</i> engendered
by increasing productivity in other branches of industry,
for example among knitters.  Or—as likewise
happens in these branches—he seeks to extend the
<i>absolute labour-time</i>, thus, in fact, producing
<i>absolute surplus-value</i>.  It is correct, however,
that <i>productivity</i> in the luxury industries cannot
reduce the <i>value</i> of labour-power, it cannot produce
any relative surplus-value and, in general, cannot produce
<i>that form</i> of surplus-value which results from the
<i>growing productivity</i> of industry <i>as
such</i>.&gt;</p>
<p>The amount of surplus-value is determined in two
ways.  [First,] by the rate of surplus-value, that is,
the surplus labour (absolute or relative) of the individual
workers.  Secondly, by the number of workers
simultaneously employed.  Insofar therefore as
increasing productivity in the luxury industry reduces the
<i>number of workers</i> which a certain quantity of capital
employs, it reduced the <i>amount of surplus-value</i>,
hence all other circumstances remaining unchanged, it
reduces also the <i>rate of profit</i>.  The same thing
occurs if the number of workers is reduced, or remains the
<i>same</i>, but the capital laid out on machinery and raw
materials is increased; in other words, it occurs wherever
there is any diminution in the ratio of variable capital to
the total capital which [according to our assumption] 
is not balanced or partially offset by a reduction in
wages.  But since the rate of profit in this sphere
<span class="context">||1098|</span> enters into the
equalisation process of the general rate of profit just as
much as that in any other sphere, increased productivity in
the luxury industry would, in the case under consideration,
bring about a fall in the general rate of profit.</p>
<p>Conversely: If the increased productivity in the luxury
industry was [due to improvements carried out not in that
industry itself, but] in those branches of industry which
provide it with constant capital, then the rate of profit
would rise in the luxury industry.</p>
<p>&lt;<i>Surplus-value</i> (that is, its size, its
quantity, its total amount) <i><a id="tsv3p351">is</a></i>
determined by the rate of surplus-value multiplied by the
number of workers employed.  Certain circumstances may
affect both factors simultaneously either in the same
direction or in opposite directions, or they may affect only
one of the factors.  Apart from the absolute
lengthening of the working-day, increased productivity in
the luxury industry can affect only the number [of workers
employed].  The inevitable consequence therefore is a
reduction in the amount of surplus-value and hence in the
rate of profit, even if no increase in constant capital
takes place.  If the constant capital increases,
however, a reduced amount of surplus-value is calculated on
an increased total capital.&gt;</p>
<h4>***</h4>
<p>Ramsay comes closer to a correct understanding of the
rate of profit than the others.  The shortcomings too
are therefore more conspicuous in his exposition.  He
brings out all the factors involved, but he does it
one-sidedly and therefore incorrectly.</p>
<p>Ramsay sums up his view of profit in the following
passage:</p>
<p class="quote">“… the causes which regulate
the rate of profit in individual cases […] we
have found to be,<a href="#_ftn29" id="_ftnref29">[cc]</a> 1) The Productiveness of the Industry engaged in
raising those articles of primary<a href="#_ftn30" id="_ftnref30">[dd]</a> necessity which are required by
the Labourer for Food, Clothing, etc.  2) The
Productiveness of the Industry employed in raising those<a href="#_ftn31" id="_ftnref31">[ee]</a> objects which enter
into the composition of Fixed Capital.  3) <i>The rate
of Real Wages</i>”</p>
<p>&lt;here this must mean the quantity of necessaries,
etc., which the worker receives, irrespective of the price
of the commodities which that quantity comprises&gt;.</p>
<p class="quote">“A variation in the first and third
of these causes, acts upon profit by altering the proportion
of the gross produce which goes to the labourer: a change in
the <i>second</i> affects the same, by modifying the
proportion necessary for replacing, either <i>directly</i>
or <i>by means of exchange</i>, the fixed capital consumed
in production; for […] profit is essentially a
question of proportion” (loc. cit., p. 172).</p>
<p>He rightly reproaches Ricardo (although Ramsay’s own
presentation is also inadequate):</p>
<p class="quote">“<!-- TSV 3, p. 352 -->Mr. <i>Ricardo</i> […] seems
always to consider the whole produce as divided between
wages and profits, forgetting the part necessary for
replacing fixed capital”<a href="#_ftn32" id="_ftnref32">[ff]</a> (loc. cit., p. 174, note).</p>
<h4>***</h4>
<p>&lt;It can already be noted in the first description of
accumulation, i.e., of the conversion of surplus-value into
capital, that the entire surplus labour takes the form of
<i>capital</i> (constant and variable) and of <i>surplus
labour</i> (profit, interest, rent).  For this
conversion reveals that surplus labour itself assumes the
form of capital and that the unpaid labour of the worker
confronts him as the <i>totality of the objective conditions
of labour</i>.  In this form it confronts him as alien
property with the result that the capital which is
antecedent to his labour, appears to be independent of
it.  [It appears] as a ready-made value of a given
magnitude, whose value the worker merely has to
augment.  It is never the product of his past labour
(nor any circumstances which, <i>independently of the
particular labour process</i> into which the past labour of
his enters, affect or increase its value) which, or the
replacement of which, appears as exploitation, but it is
always merely the manner and the rate in which his present
labour is exploited.  As long as the individual
capitalist continues to operate on the same scale of
production (or on an expanding one), the replacement of
capital appears as an operation which does not affect the
worker, since, if the means of production belonged to the
worker, he would likewise have to replace them out of the
gross product in order to continue reproduction on the same
scale or on an expanded scale (and the latter too is
necessary because of the natural increase of
population).  But this affects the worker in three
respects.  1) The perpetuation of the means of
production as property alien to him, as capital, perpetuates
his condition as wage-worker and hence his fate of always
having to work part of his labour-time for a third person
for nothing.  2) The extension of these means of
production, alias accumulation of capital, increases the
extent and the size of the classes who live on the surplus
labour of the worker; it worsens his position
<i>relatively</i> by augmenting the relative wealth of the
capitalist and his co-partners, by further
<a id="tsv3p353">increasing</a> his relative surplus labour through the
division of labour, etc., and reduces that part of the gross
product which is used to pay wages; finally, since the
conditions of labour confront the individual worker in an
ever more gigantic form and increasingly as social forces,
the chance of his taking possession of them himself as is
the case in small-scale industry, disappears.&gt;</p>
<h3>[3.  Ramsay on the Division of “Gross
Profit” into “Net Profit” (Interest) and
“Profit of Enterprise”. 
Apologetic Elements in His Views on the “Labour of
superintendence”, “Insurance Covering the Risk
Involved” and “Excess Profit”]</h3>
<p><span class="context">||1099|</span> Ramsay uses the term
<i>gross profit</i> for what I call simply profit.  He
divides this <i>gross profit</i> into <i>net profit</i>
(interest) and <i>profit of enterprise</i> (industrial
profit).<a href="#_ftn33" id="_ftnref33">*</a></p>
<p>Ramsay, like Ricardo, takes issue with Adam Smith on the
question of the <i>fall in the general rate of
profit</i>.  Refuting Smith, he writes:</p>
<p class="quote">“Competition of the
master-capitalists” can indeed even out profits which
rise considerably above “the ordinary level”
(this levelling is by no means a sufficient explanation for
the formation of a general rate of profit) but it is wrong
to say that <i>this ordinary level itself is lowered</i>.<a href="#_ftn34" id="_ftnref34">[gg]</a></p>
<p class="quote">“… could we suppose it<a href="#_ftn35" id="_ftnref35">[hh]</a> possible that the
Price of every commodity, both raw and fabricated, should
fall in consequence of the competition among the producers,
yet this could not in any way affect profit.  Each
master-capitalist would sell his produce for less money, but
on the other hand, every article of his expenses, whether
belonging to fixed capital or to circulating, would cost him
a proportionally smaller sum” (op. cit.,
pp. 180-81).</p>
<p>The following passage is directed <i>against
Malthus:</i></p>
<p class="quote">“The idea of profits being p aid by
the consumers, is, assuredly, very absurd.  Who are the
consumers?  They must be either landlords, capitalists,
masters, labourers, or else people who receive a
salary…” (loc. cit., p. 183).</p>
<!-- TSV 3, p. 354 -->
<p class="quote">“<i>The only competition</i> which
can <i>affect the general rate of gross profits</i>, is that
between master-capitalists and labourers…”
(op. cit., p. 206).</p>
<p>The last sentence expresses the true gist of Ricardo’s
proposition.  The rate of profit can fall independently
of the competition between capital and labour, but
<i>this</i> is the <i>only kind of competition</i> which can
bring about its decrease.  Ramsay himself, however,
does <i>not</i> advance <i>any</i> reasons why the general
rate of profit has a tendency to fall.  The only thing
he says—and which is correct—is that the <i>rate
of interest</i> can fall quite independently of the rate of
gross profits in a given country, namely:</p>
<p class="quote">“But were we even to suppose, that
capital was never borrowed with any view but to productive
employment [I think] it very possible that interest might
vary without any change in the rate of gross profits. 
For, as a nation advances in the career of wealth, a class
of men springs up and increases more and more, who by the
labours” (exploitation, robbery) “of their
ancestors find themselves in the possession of funds
sufficiently ample to afford a handsome maintenance from the
interest alone.  Very many also who during youth and
middle age were actively engaged in business, retire in
their latter days to live quietly on the interest of the
sums they have themselves accumulated.  This class<a href="#_ftn36" id="_ftnref36">[ii]</a> […] has a
tendency to increase with the increasing riches of the
country, for those who begin with a tolerable stock are
likely to make an independence sooner than they who commence
with little.  Thus it comes to pass, that<a href="#_ftn37" id="_ftnref37">[jj]</a> in old and rich
countries, the amount of national capital belonging to those
who are unwilling to take the trouble of employing it
themselves, bears a larger proportion to the whole
productive stock of the society, than in newly settled and
poorer districts.<a href="#_ftn38" id="_ftnref38">[kk]</a>
How […] numerous [is] the class of rentiers […] in England [… ] As the class of
<i>rentiers</i> increases, so also does that of lenders of
capital, for they are one and the same.  Therefore,
from this cause interest must have a tendency to fall in old
countries…” (loc. cit., pp. 201-02).</p>
<p>Ramsay says the following about the <i>rate of net
profit</i> (interest):</p>
<p class="quote">“The rate of these” [profits]
“must depend,<a href="#_ftn39" id="_ftnref39">[ll]</a> partly upon the rate of gross
profits […] partly on the proportion in which these
are separated into profits of capital and those of
enterprise.<a href="#_ftn40" id="_ftnref40">[mm]</a> This
proportion […] depends upon the competition between
the lenders of capital and […] borrowers […],
which competition<a href="#_ftn41" id="_ftnref41">[nn]</a>
is influenced, though by no means entirely
<i><a id="tsv3p355">regulated</a></i>, by the rate of gross profit expected
to be realised, And the […] competition is not
exclusively regulated by this cause […] because on
the one hand many borrow without any view to productive
employment; and […] because <i>the proportion of the
whole national capital to be lent, varies with the riches of
the country independently of any change in gross
profits</i>” (loc. cit., pp. 206-07). 
“<i>The profits of enterprise depend upon the net
profits of capital</i> not the latter upon the former”
(loc. cit., p. 214).</p>
<p><span class="context">||1100|</span> Apart from the
circumstance mentioned earlier, Ramsay
says—rightly:</p>
<p class="quote">Interest is only a measure of net profits where the level
of civilisation is such that the “want of
certainty” of repayment is not a factor which enters
into the calculation.<a href="#_ftn42" id="_ftnref42">[oo]</a> “In England, for instance,
at the present day, we cannot, I think, consider<a href="#_ftn43" id="_ftnref43">[pp]</a> compensation for
risk as at all entering into the interest received from
funds lent on what would be cabled good security”
(op. cit., p. 199, note).</p>
<p>Speaking of the <i>industrial capitalist</i>, whom he
calls the master-capitalist, Ramsay remarks:</p>
<p class="quote">“He is the general distributor of the
national revenue; the person who undertakes to pay<a href="#_ftn44" id="_ftnref44">[qq]</a> […] to the
labourers, the wages, […]—to the capitalist,
the interest […]—to the proprietor, the rent
[… ] On the one hand are masters, on the other,
labourers, capitalists and landlords [… ] The
interests of these two grand classes are diametrically
opposed to each other.  It is the master who
<i>hires</i> labour, capital, and land, and of course tries
to get the use of them on as low terms as possible; while
the owners of these sources of wealth do their best to
<i>let</i> them as high as they can” (op. cit.,
pp. 218-19).</p>
<p><i>Industrial profit.  (Labour of
superintendence</i>.)</p>
<p>What Ramsay writes about <i>industrial profit</i> (and
especially, about the labour of superintendence) is on the
whole the most reasonable part of his book, although part of
his demonstration is borrowed from <i>Storch</i>.</p>
<p>The exploitation of labour costs labour.  Insofar as
the labour performed by the industrial capitalist is
rendered necessary only because of the contradiction between
capital and labour, it enters into the cost of his overseers
(the industrial non-commissioned officers) and is already
included in the category of wages in the same way as costs
caused by the slave overseer and his whip are included in
the production costs of the slave-owner.  These costs,
like the greater part of the trading expenses, belong to
the
<a id="tsv3p356">incidental</a> expenses of capitalist production.  As
far as the general <i>rate of profit</i> is concerned, the
labour of the capitalists arising from their competition
with one another and their attempts to ruin one another
counts just as little as the greater or lesser skill of one
industrial capitalist compared to another in extracting the
largest amount of surplus labour from his workers for the
smallest expenditure and making the best use of this
extracted surplus labour in the process of
circulation.  These matters should be dealt with in the
analysis of the competition of capitals.  Such an
analysis deals in general with the struggle of the
capitalists and their effort to acquire the greatest
possible amount of surplus labour and it is concerned only
with the division of the surplus labour amongst the
different individual capitalists, and not with the origin of
surplus labour or its general extent.</p>
<p>All that remains for the labour of superintendence is the
general function of organising the division of labour and
the cooperation of certain individuals.  This labour is
fully taken into account in the wages of the general manager
in the larger capitalist enterprises.  It has already
been deducted from the general rate of profit.  The
best practical proof of this is provided by the co-operative
factories set up by the English workers, for these, despite
the higher rate of interest they have to pay, yield profits
higher than average, although the wages of the general
manager, which are naturally determined by the market price
for this kind of labour, are deducted.  The industrial
capitalists who are their own general managers save one item
of the production costs, pay wages to themselves, and
consequently receive a rate of profit above the
average.  If this assertion of the apologists [that
profit of enterprise constitutes wages for the labour of
superintendence] were taken literally tomorrow, and the
profit of the industrial capitalist limited to the <i>wages
of management and direction</i>, then capitalist production,
the appropriation of the surplus labour of others and its
transformation into capital would come to an end the day
after tomorrow.</p>
<p>However, if we consider this [payment of the] labour of
superintendence as wages concealed in the <i>general rate of
profit</i>, then the law established by Ramsay and others
applies, namely, that while profit (industrial profit as
well as gross profit [including interest]) is proportional
to the amount of capital invested, this portion of the
profit stands in <i>inverse ratio</i> to the size of the
capital, it is infinitesimally small in the ease of large
capital and enormously large where the capital is small,
i.e., where the capitalist
<a id="tsv3p357">production</a> is purely nominal.  Whereas the
small capitalist, who does almost all the work himself,
seems to obtain a very high rate of profit in proportion to
his capital, what happens in fact is that, if he does not
employ a few workers whose surplus labour he appropriates,
he actually makes <i>no profit</i> at all and his enterprise
is only <i>nominally</i> a capitalist one.  (whether he
is engaged in industry or in commerce).  What
distinguishes him from the wage-worker is that, because of
his nominal capital he is indeed the master and owner of his
own conditions of labour and consequently has no master over
him; <span class="context">||1101|</span> and hence he
appropriates his whole labour-time himself instead of it
being appropriated by someone else.  What appears to be
profit here, is merely the excess [of his income] over
ordinary wages, an excess which results from the fact that
he appropriates his own surplus labour.  However, this
phenomenon belongs exclusively to those spheres which have
not as yet been really conquered by the capitalist mode of
production.</p>
<p>[Ramsay says:]</p>
<p class="quote">“The profits of enterprise may
… be considered as made up of 3 parts: one…
the salary of … the master; another an insurance for
risk; the remainder … his <i>surplus gains</i>”
(op. cit., p. 226).</p>
<p>As regards point 2, it is quite irrelevant here. 
Corbet (and Ramsay himself) has stated that the
<i>insurance</i> which covers the risk only distributes the
losses of the capitalists uniformly or distributes them more
generally amongst the whole class.  The profits of the
insurance companies—that is, of the capitals which are
employed in the business of insurance, and take over this
distribution—must be deducted from these uniformly
distributed losses.  These companies receive a part of
the surplus-value in the same way as mercantile or moneyed
capitalists do, without participating in its direct
production.  This is a question of the distribution of
the surplus-value amongst the different sorts of capitalists
and of the deductions which are consequently made from [the
surplus-value accruing to] the individual capitalists. 
It has nothing to do either with the nature or with the
magnitude of the surplus.  The worker obviously cannot
provide any more than his surplus labour.  He cannot
make an additional payment to the capitalist so that the
latter may insure the fruits of this surplus labour against
loss.  At most one could say that, even apart from
capitalist production, the producers themselves might have
certain expenses, that is, they would have to spend a part
of their labour, or of the products of their labour in order
to insure their
<a id="tsv3p358">products</a>, their wealth, or the elements of their wealth,
against accidents, etc.  Instead of each capitalist
insuring himself, it is safer as well as cheaper for him if
one section of capital is entrusted with this job. 
Insurance is paid out of a portion of surplus-value, its
protection and distribution between the capitalists has
nothing to do with its origin and magnitude.</p>
<p>What is left is 1) the salary and 2) the surplus gains,
as Ramsay calls that part of surplus-value which falls to
the industrial capitalist as opposed to the interest-grabber
and which, consequently, is determined by the ratio of
interest to industrial profit; the two parts into which the
surplus-value accruing to capital (in contrast to landed
property) is divided.</p>
<p>As far as 1), the salary, is concerned, it is first of
all self-evident that in capitalist production, the function
of capital as lord over labour falls to the capitalist, or a
clerk or a representative paid by him.  Even this
function would disappear together with the capitalist mode
of production, insofar as it does not arise from the nature
of co-operative labour but from the domination of the
conditions of labour over labour itself.  Ramsay
himself however sweeps away this element or reduces it to
such an extent that it is not worth speaking of.</p>
<p class="quote">The salary [of the employer], like the work [of
superintendence], remains roughly the same, be the concern
large or small (loc. cit., pp. 227-29).  A worker will
never be able to say that he can do the same amount of work
as two, three or more of his workmates.  But one
industrial capitalist or farmer can take the place of ten or
more<a href="#_ftn45" id="_ftnref45">[rr]</a> (p.
255).</p>
<p>The third part [of the profits of enterprise], the
<i>surplus gains</i>, includes [compensation for]
risks—which are only <i>possible</i> risks, nothing
but the possibility of losing the gains and the
capital—it in fact however takes the form of
insurance and therefore of a share which certain capitals in
a particular branch receive in the total surplus-value.</p>
<p class="quote">“These surplus gains,” Ramsay
writes, “do truly represent […] the revenue
derived from <i>the power of commanding the use of
capital</i>” (in other words from the power of
commanding other people’s labour) “whether belonging
to the person himself or borrowed from others… 
these<a href="#_ftn46" id="_ftnref46">[ss]</a> net
profits” (interest) “vary exactly as the amount
of capital […] on the contrary […] the larger
the capital, the greater the proportion they bear<a href="#_ftn47" id="_ftnref47">[tt]</a> to the stock
employed” (loc. cit., p. 230).


<p><a id="tsv3p359">In</a> other words, this means nothing more than that the
salaries of masters stand in inverse ratio to the size of
the capital.  The larger the scale on which the capital
operates, the more <i>capitalist</i> the mode of production,
the more negligible is the element of industrial profit
which is reducible to salary, and the more clearly appears
the real character of industrial profit, namely, that it is
a part of the surplus gains, i.e., of surplus-value, i.e.,
of unpaid surplus labour.</p>
<p>The whole contradiction between industrial profit and
interest only has meaning as a contradiction between the
rentier and the industrial capitalist, but it has not the
slightest bearing on the relationship of the worker to
capital, the nature of capital, or the origin of the profit
capital yields.</p>
<p>With regard to <i>rent not derived from corn</i>, Ramsay
says:</p>
<p class="quote">“In this manner the rent paid for one
species of produce becomes the cause of the <i>high value of
others</i>” (op. cit., p. 279).</p>
<p class="quote">“<i>Revenue</i>,” says Ramsay
in the final chapter, “differs from the annual gross
produce, simply by the absence of all those objects which go
to keep up <i>fixed capital</i>” (by which he means
<i>constant capital</i>, raw materials in all stages of
production, auxiliary materials and machinery, etc.) 
(op. cit., p.  471).</p>
<p><span class="context">||1102|</span> Ramsay has already
said<a href="#_ftn48" id="_ftnref48">[uu]</a> and repeats
in the final chapter that</p>
<p class="quote">“circulating
capital”—that is his term for capital laid out
in wages—is superfluous, it is “… not<a href="#_ftn49" id="_ftnref49">[vv]</a> an
<i>immediate</i> agent in production, nor even
<i>essential</i> to it at all…” (loc. cit.,
p. 468).</p>
<p>But he does not draw the obvious conclusion that by
denying that wage-labour and capital laid out in wages are
essential, the <i>necessity</i> for capitalist production in
general is denied and the conditions of labour consequently
cease to confront the workers as “capital” or,
to use Ramsay’s term, as “fixed capital”. 
One part of the conditions of labour appears as fixed
<i>capital</i> only because the other part appears as
circulating <i>capital</i>.  But once capitalist
production is presupposed as a fact, Ramsay declares that
<i>wages</i> and <i>gross profits of capital</i> (industrial
profit or, as he calls it, profit of enterprise included)
are necessary forms of revenue (loc. cit., pp. 478,
475).</p>
<p>These are naturally the two forms of revenue which, in
their simplicity and generality, indeed epitomise the
essence of the
<a id="tsv3p360">capitalist</a> mode of production and of the two classes on
which it is based.  On the other hand, Ramsay declares
that <i>rent</i>, in other words landed property, is a
superfluous form of capitalist production (l.c., p. 472),
but forgets that it is a necessary product of this mode of
production.  The same applies to his statement that the
“net profit of capital”, that is, interest, is
not a necessary form.</p>
<p class="quote">[In case of a sharp reduction in gross profits] it would
only be necessary for the rentiers to become industrial
capitalists.  As regards national wealth this makes no
difference…  The gross profit need certainly not
be so high as to afford separate incomes to the owner and
the employer<a href="#_ftn50" id="_ftnref50">[ww]</a>
(pp. 476-77).</p>
<p>Here Ramsay again forgets what he has said himself,
namely that, as a necessary consequence of the development
of capital, a constantly growing class of rentiers comes
into being.<a href="#_ftn51" id="_ftnref51">[xx]</a></p>
<p class="quote">“… gross profit [of capital
and enterprise] is […] essential in order that
production should go on at all…” (loc. cit.,
p. 475).</p>
<p>Naturally.  Without profit, no capital and without
capital, no capitalist production.</p>
<h4>***</h4>
<p>Thus, the conclusion at which Ramsay arrives is, on the
one hand, that the capitalist mode of production based on
wage-labour is not really a necessary, i.e., not an absolute
form of social production (which Ramsay himself expresses
only in a rather limited form by stating that
“circulating capital” and “wages”
[would be] superfluous if the mass of the people were not so
poor that they had to receive their share of the product in
advance, before it was completed).  On the other hand,
he concludes that interest (in contrast to industrial
profit) and rent (that is the form of landed property
created by capitalist production itself) are superfetations
which are not essential to capitalist production and of
which it can rid itself.  If this bourgeois ideal were
actually realisable, the only result would be that the whole
of the surplus-value would go to the industrial capitalist
directly, and society would be reduced (economically) to the
simple contradiction between capital and wage-labour, a
simplification which would indeed accelerate the dissolution
of this mode of production.  <span class="context">|1102||</span></p>
<h4>***</h4>
<p><span class="context">||1102|</span> &lt;In the
<i>Morning</i> Star (December 1, 1862), a manufacturer
moans:</p>
<p class="quote">“<i>Deduct</i> from the <i>gross
produce</i> the wages of labour, the rent of land, the
interest on capital, the cost of raw material, and the
<i>gains of the agent, merchant, or dealer</i>, and what
remained was the <i>profit of the manufacturer</i>, the
Lancashire resident, the occupier, on whom the <i>burden of
maintaining the workmen for so many partakers in the
distribution of the gross produce is thrown</i>.”</p>
<p>If one disregards the value and considers the gross
produce in kind, it is clear that after the replacement of
the constant capital and the capital laid out in wages, that
portion of the product which remains constitutes the
surplus-value.  From this however has to be deducted a
portion for rent and the gains of the agents, merchants or
dealers, all of whom, whether they use capital of their own
or not, also share in that part of the gross product which
constitutes surplus-value.  All these therefore are
<i>deductions</i> for the manufacturer.  His profit
itself is subdivided into industrial profit and
interest—if he has borrowed capital.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;With regard to <i>differential rent:</i> The work
of the labourer working on more fertile soil is more
productive than that of a man working on less fertile
soil.  If, therefore, he were to be paid in kind, he
would receive a smaller share of the gross product than the
labourer working on less fertile soil.  Or, what
amounts to the same thing, his relative surplus labour would
be greater than that of the other labourer, although he
worked the same number of hours per day.  But the value
of the wage of the one is equal to that of the other. 
Hence the profit of his employer is no greater [than that of
the other employer].  The surplus-value contained in
the additional amount of his product, the greater relative
productivity of his labour, or the differential surplus
labour performed by him, is pocketed by the landlord.&gt;

 Mr. Senior—whose <i>Outline</i> appeared at

 division of profit into profit of enterprise and into
 “net profits of capital or interest” (Chapter
 IV) is dealt with at length—is supposed to have
 discovered this division, which was already known in 1821

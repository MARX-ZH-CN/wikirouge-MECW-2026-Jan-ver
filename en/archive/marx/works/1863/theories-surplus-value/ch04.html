<h1>[CHAPTER IV] 
Theories of Productive and Unproductive Labour</h1>
<p>We come now to the last controversial point in Adam
Smith’s writings which we have to consider: <i>the
distinction between productive and unproductive
labour</i>.</p>
<p><span class="context">||300|</span> In Adam Smith’s
definition of what he calls productive labour as
distinguished from unproductive labour, we find the same
two-sided approach as we have found on every question up to
now.  Jumbled together in his presentation we find two
definitions of what he calls productive labour, and to begin
with we will examine the first, the correct definition.</p>
<p><a id="s1"> </a></p>
<h3>[1.  Productive Labour from the Standpoint of
Capitalist Production: Labour Which Produces
Surplus-Value]</h3>
<p>Productive labour, in its meaning for capitalist
production, is wage-labour which, exchanged against the
variable part of capital (the part of the capital that is
spent on wages), reproduces not only this part of the
capital (or the value of its own labour-power), but in
addition produces surplus-value for the capitalist, It is
only thereby that commodity or money is transformed into
capital, is produced as capital.  Only that wage-labour
is productive which produces capital.  (This is the
same as saying that it reproduces on an enlarged scale the
sum of value expended on it, or that it gives in return more
labour than it receives in the form of wages. 
Consequently, only that labour-power is productive which
produces a value greater than its own.)</p>
<p>The mere existence of a class of capitalists, and
therefore of capital, depends on the productivity of labour:
not however on its absolute, but on its relative
productivity.  For example: if a day’s labour only
sufficed to keep the worker alive, that is, to reproduce his
labour-power, <span class="context">||301|</span> speaking
in an absolute sense his labour would be productive because
it would be reproductive; that is to say, because it
constantly replaced the values ( equal to the value of its
own labour-power) which it consumed.  But in the
capitalist sense it would not be productive because it
produced no surplus-value.  (It produced in fact no new
value, but only replaced the old; it would have consumed
it—the value—in one form, in order to reproduce it in
the other.  And in this sense it has been said that a
worker is productive whose production is equal to his own
consumption, and that a worker is unproductive who consumes
more than he reproduces.)</p>
<p>Productivity in the capitalist sense is based on relative
productivity—that the worker not only replaces an old
value, but creats a new one; that he materialises more
labour-time in his product than is materialised in the
product that keeps him in existence as a worker.  It is
this kind of productive wage-labour that is the basis for
the existence of capital.</p>
<p>&lt;Assuming, however, that no capital exists, but that
the worker appropriates his surplus-labour himself—the
excess of values that he has created over the values that he
consumes.  Then one could say only of this labour that
it is truly productive, that is, that it creates new
values.&gt;</p>
<p><a id="s2"> </a></p>
<h3>[2.  Views of the Physiocrats and Mercantilists on
Productive Labour]</h3>
<p>This conception of productive labour follows naturally
from Adam Smith’s view of the origin of surplus-value, that
is, of the nature of capital.  In so far as he holds to
this conception he is following a course that was taken by
the Physiocrats and even by the Mercantilists; he only frees
it from misconceptions, and in this way brings out its inner
kernel.  Though wrong in thinking that only
agricultural labour is productive, the Physiocrats put
forward the correct view that from the capitalist standpoint
only that labour is productive which creates a
surplus—value; and in fact a surplus—value not
for itself, but for the owner of the conditions of
production; labour which produces a net product not for
itself, but for the landowner, For the surplus-value or
surplus labour-time is materialised in a surplus-produce or
net product.  (But here again they have a wrong
conception of this; in as much as there is, for example,
more wheat than labourers and farmers eat; but also in the
case of cloth there is more than what the cloth
manufacturers—workman and master—need for their
own clothing.) Surplus-value itself is wrongly conceived,
because they have a wrong idea of value and reduce it to the
use-value of labour, not to labour-time, social, homogeneous
labour.  Nevertheless, there remains the correct
definition that only the wage-labour which creates more
value than it costs is productive.  Adam Smith frees
this definition from the wrong conception with which the
Physiocrats linked it.</p>
<p>If we go back from the Physiocrats to the Mercantilists,
there too we find one aspect of their theory which contains
the same view of productive labour, even though they were
not conscious of it, The basis of their theory was the idea
that labour is only productive in those branches of
production whose products, when sent abroad, bring back more
money than they have cost (or than had to be exported in
exchange for them); which therefore enabled a country to
participate to a greater degree in the products of
newly-opened gold and silver mines.  They saw that in
these countries there was a rapid growth of wealth and of
the middle class.  What in fact was the source of this
influence exerted by gold?  Wages did not rise in
proportion to the prices of commodities; that is, wages
fell, and because of this relative surplus-labour increased
and the rate of profit rose—not because the labourer
had become more productive, but because the absolute wage
(that is to say, the quantity of means of existence which
the labourer received) was forced down—in a word,
because the position of the workers grew worse.  In
these countries, therefore, labour was in fact more
productive for those who employed it.  This fact was
linked with the influx of the precious metals; and it was
this, though they were only dimly aware of it, which led the
Mercantilists to declare that labour employed in such
branches of production was alone productive.</p>
<p class="quote"><span class="context">||302|</span>
“The remarkable increase [of population] which has
taken place […] in almost every European State,
during the last fifty or sixty years, has perhaps proceeded
chiefly from the increased productiveness of the American
mines.  An increased abundance of the precious
metals” (of course as a result of the fall in their
real value) “raises the price of commodities in a
greater proportion than the price of labour; it depresses
the condition of the labourer, and at the same time
increases the gains of his employer, who is thus induced to
enlarge his circulating capital to the utmost of his
ability, to hire as many hands as he has the means to
pay;—and it has been seen that this is precisely the
state of things most favourable to the increase of
people…  Mr. Malthus observes, that ‘the
discovery of the mines of America, during the time that it
raised the rice of corn between three and four times, did
not nearly so much as double the price of
labour’.  — The price of commodities
intended for home consumption (of corn for instance) does
not immediately rise in consequence of an influx of money;
but as the rate of profit in agricultural employments is
thus depressed below the rate of profit in manufactures,
capital will gradually be withdrawn from the former to the
latter: thus all capital comes to yield higher profits than
formerly, and a rise of profits is always equivalent to a
fall of wages” (John Barton, <i>Observations on the
Circumstances which Influence the Condition of the Labouring
Classes of Society</i>, London, 1817, pp. 29 sqq.).<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">*</a></p>
<p>So, firstly, according to Barton, in the second half of
the eighteenth century there was a repetition of the same
phenomenon as that which, from the last third of the
sixteenth century and in the seventeenth, has given the
impulse to the Mercantile system.  Secondly  as only
exported goods were measured in gold and silver on the basis
of its reduced value, while those for home consumption
continued to be measured in gold and silver according to its
former value (until competition among the capitalists put an
end to this measuring by two different standards), labour in
the former branches of production appeared to be directly
productive, that is, creating surplus-value, through the
depression of wages below their former level.</p>
<p><a id="s3"> </a></p>
<h3>[3.  The Duality in Smith’s Conception of Productive
Labour.  His First Explanation: the View of Productive
Labour as Labour Exchanged for Capital]</h3>
<p>The second, wrong conception of productive labour which
Smith develops is so interwoven with the correct one that
the two follow each other in rapid succession in the same
passage.  To illustrate the first conception it is
therefore necessary to tear the quotations into separate
parts.</p>
<p class="quote">“There is one sort of labour which adds to the
value of the subject upon which it is bestowed: there is
another which has no such effect.  The former, <i>as it
produces a value</i>, may be called <i>productive</i>; the
latter, <i>unproductive labour</i>.  Thus the labour
of a manufacturer <i>adds</i>, generally, to the value of
the materials which he works upon, <i>that of his own
maintenance, and of his master’s profit</i>.  The
labour of a menial servant, on the contrary, adds to the
value of nothing.  Though the manufacturer has his
wages <i>advanced</i> to him by his master, he, <i>in
reality, costs him no expense</i>, the value of those wages
being generally restored, <i>together with a profit</i>, in
the improved value of the subject upon which his labour is
bestowed.  But the maintenance of a menial servant
never is restored.  A man <i>grows</i> rich by
employing a multitude of manufacturers: he grows poor, by
maintaining a multitude of menial servants” ([Adam
Smith, <i>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the
Wealth of Nations</i>,] b. II, ch. III, Vol. II,
ed. McCulloch, pp. 93 and 94).</p>
<p>In this passage—and in its continuation to be
quoted later, the contradictory definitions jostle each
other even more closely—what is in the main and
pre-eminently understood by productive labour is labour
which produces a surplus-value—“his master’s
profit”—in addition to the reproduction of the
value of “his” (the labourer’s) “own
maintenance”.  Also, the industrialist could not
grow <i>rich</i> “by employing a multitude of
manufacturers” (working men), unless the latter, in
addition to the value which their own maintenance costs,
added also a surplus-value.</p>
<p>Secondly, however, in this passage Adam Smith treats as
productive labour, labour which in general “produces a
value”.  <span class="context">||303|</span>
Leaving this latter statement out of account for the moment,
however, we will first cite other passages in which the
first conception is partly repeated, partly formulated more
sharply, but particularly also further developed.</p>
<p class="quote">“If the quantity of food and
clothing, which were — consumed by unproductive, had
been distributed among productive hands, they would have
reproduced, <i>together with a profit</i>, the full value of
their consumption” (l.c., p. 109; b. II, ch. III).</p>
<p>Here the productive labourer is quite explicitly one who
not only produces for the capitalist the full value of the
means of subsistence contained in his wages, but reproduces
it for him “with a profit”.</p>
<p>Only labour which produces capital is productive
labour.  Commodities or money become capital, however,
through being exchanged directly for labour-power, and
exchanged only in order to be replaced by more labour than
they themselves contain.  For the use-value of
labour-power to the capitalist as a capitalist does not
consist in its <i>actual</i> use-value, in the usefulness of
this particular concrete labour—that it is spinning
labour, weaving labour, and so on.  He is as little
concerned with this as with the use-value of the product of
this labour as such, since for the capitalist the product is
a commodity (even before its first metamorphosis), not an
article of consumption.  What interests him in the
commodity is that it has more exchange-value than he paid
for it; and therefore the use-value of the labour is, for
him, that he gets back a greater quantity of labour-time
than he has paid out in the form of wages.  Included
among these productive workers, of course, are all those who
contribute in one way or another to the production of the
commodity, from the actual operative to the manager or
engineer (as distinct from the capitalist), And so even the
latest English official report on the factories
“<i>explicitly</i>” includes in the category of
employed wage-labourers all persons employed in the
factories and in the offices attached to them, with the
exception of the manufacturers themselves (see the wording
of the report before the concluding part of this
rubbish).</p>
<p>Productive labour is here defined from the standpoint of
capitalist production, and Adam Smith here got to the very
heart of the matter, hit the nail on the head.  This is
one of his greatest scientific merits (as Malthus rightly
observed, this critical differentiation between productive
and unproductive labour remains the basis of all bourgeois
political economy) that he defines productive labour as
labour <i>which is directly exchanged with capital;</i> that
is, he defines it by the exchange through which the
conditions of production of labour, and value in general,
whether money or commodity, are first transformed into
capital (and labour into wage-labour in its scientific
meaning).</p>
<p>This also establishes absolutely what <i>unproductive
labour</i> is.  It is labour which is not exchanged
with capital, but <i>directly</i> with revenue, that is,
with wages or profit (including of course the various
categories of those who share as co-partners in the
capitalist’s profit, such as interest and rent).  Where
all labour in part still pays itself (like for example the
agricultural labour of the serfs) and in part is directly
exchanged for revenue (like the manufacturing labour in the
cities of Asia), no capital and no wage-labour exists in the
sense of bourgeois political economy.  These
definitions are therefore not derived from the material
characteristics of labour (neither from the nature of its
product nor from the particular character of the labour as
concrete labour), but from the definite social form, the
social relations of production, within which the labour is
realised.  An actor, for example, or even a clown,
according to this definition, is a productive labourer if he
works in the service of a capitalist (an entrepreneur) to
whom he returns more labour than he receives from him in the
form of wages; while a jobbing tailor who comes to the
capitalist’s house and patches his trousers for him,
producing a mere use-value for him, is an unproductive
labourer.  The former’s labour is exchanged with
capital, the latter’s with revenue.  The former’s
labour produces a surplus-value; in the latter’s, revenue is
consumed.</p>
<p>Productive and unproductive labour is here throughout
conceived from <i>the standpoint of the possessor of money,
from the standpoint of the capitalist</i>, not from that of
the <i>workman;</i> hence the nonsense written by Ganilh,
etc., who have so little understanding of the matter that
they raise the question whether the labour or service or
function of the prostitute, flunkey, etc., brings in
returns.  <span class="context">|303||</span></p>
<p><span class="context">||304|</span> A writer is a
productive labourer not in so far as he produces ideas, but
in so far as he enriches the publisher who publishes his
works, or if he is a wage-labourer for a capitalist.</p>
<p>The use-value of the commodity in which the labour of a
productive worker is embodied may be of the most futile
kind.  The material characteristics are in no way
linked with its nature which on the contrary is only the
expression of a definite social relation of
production.  It is a definition of labour which is
derived not from its content or its result, but from its
particular social form.</p>
<p>On the other hand, on the assumption that capital has
conquered the whole of production—and that therefore a
<i>commodity</i> (as distinct from a mere use-value) is no
longer produced by any labourer who is himself the owner of
the conditions of production for producing this
commodity—that therefore only the capitalist is the
producer of <i>commodities</i> (the sole commodity excepted
being labour-power)—then revenue must be exchanged
either against commodities which capital alone produces and
sells, or against labour, which just like those commodities
is bought in order to be consumed; that is, only for the
sake of its particular material characteristics, its
use-value—for the sake of the <i>services</i> which,
through its particular material characteristics, it renders
to its buyer and consumer.  For the producer of these
services the services rendered are commodities.  They
have a definite use-value (imaginary or real) and a definite
exchange-value.  For the buyer, however, these services
are mere use-values, objects in which <span class="context">||305|</span> he consumes his revenue. 
These unproductive labourers do not receive their share of
revenue (of wages and profits), their co-partnership in the
commodities produced by productive labour, gratis: they must
buy their share in them; but they have nothing to do with
their production.</p>
<p>It is, however, in any case clear: the greater the part
of the revenue (wages and profit) that is spent on
commodities produced by capital, the less the part that can
be spent on the services of unproductive labourers, and vice
versa.</p>
<p>The determinate material form of the labour, and
therefore of its product, in itself has nothing to do with
this distinction between productive and unproductive
labour.  For example, the cooks and waiters in a public
hotel are productive labourers, in so far as their labour is
transformed into capital for the proprietor of the
hotel.  These same persons are unproductive labourers
as menial servants, inasmuch as I do not make capital out of
their services, but spend revenue on them.  In fact,
however, these same persons are also for me, the consumer,
unproductive labourers <i>in</i> the hotel.</p>
<p class="quote">“That part of the annual produce of
the land and labour of <i>any country which replaces a
capital</i>, never is <i>immediately</i> employed to
maintain any but productive hands.  It <i>pays the
wages of productive labour</i> only.  That which is
<i>immediately</i> destined for constituting a revenue
either as profit or as rent, may maintain indifferently
either productive or unproductive hands.  Whatever part
of his stock a man employs as a capital, he always expects
it to be replaced to him with a profit.  He employs it,
therefore, <i>in</i> maintaining <i>productive hands</i>
only; and after having served in the function of a capital
to him, it constitutes a revenue to them.  Whenever he
employs any part of it <i>in maintaining unproductive
hands</i> of any <i>kind</i>, that part is, from that
moment, withdrawn from his capital, and placed in his stock
reserved for immediate consumption” (l.c., p. 98).</p>
<p>To the extent that capital conquers the whole of
production, and therefore the home and petty form of
industry—in short, industry intended for
self-consumption, not producing
commodities—disappears, it is clear that the
unproductive labourers, those whose services are directly
exchanged against revenue, will for the most part be
performing only <i>personal</i> services, and only an
inconsiderable part of them (like cooks, seamstresses,
jobbing tailors and so on) will produce material
use-values.  That they produce no <i>commodities</i>
follows from the nature of the case.  For the commodity
as such is never an immediate object of consumption, but a
bearer of exchange-value.  Consequently only a quite
insignificant part of these unproductive labourers can play
a direct part in material production once the capitalist
mode of production has developed.  They participate in
it only through the exchange of their services against
revenue.  This does not prevent, as Adam Smith remarks,
the value of the services of these unproductive labourers
being determined and determinable in the same (or an
analogous) way as that of the productive labourers: that is,
by the production costs involved in maintaining or producing
them.  Other factors also come into play in this
connection, but they are not relevant here.</p>
<p><span class="context">||306|</span> The labour-power of
the productive labourer is a commodity for the labourer
himself.  So is that of the unproductive
labourer.  But the productive labourer produces
commodities for the buyer of his labour-power.  The
unproductive labourer produces for him a mere use-value, not
a commodity; an imaginary or a real use-value.  It is
characteristic of the unproductive labourer that he produces
no commodities for his buyer, but indeed receives
commodities from him.</p>
<p class="quote">“The labour of some of the most
respectable orders in the society is, like that of menial
servants, unproductive of any value…  The
sovereign, for example, with all the officers both of
justice and war who serve under him, the whole army and
navy, are unproductive labourers.  They are the
servants of the public, and are maintained by a part of the
annual produce of the industry of other people… 
In the same class must be ranked.., churchmen, lawyers,
physicians, men of letters of all kinds; players, buffoons,
musicians, opera-singers, opera-dancers, etc.” (l.c.,
pp. 94-95).</p>
<p>It itself, as has been said, this distinction between
productive and unproductive labour has nothing to do either
with the particular speciality of the labour or with the
particular use-value in which this special labour is
incorporated.  In the one case the labour is exchanged
with capital, in the other with revenue.  In the one
case the labour is transformed into capital, and creates a
profit for the capitalist; in the other case it is an
expenditure, one of the articles in which revenue is
consumed.  For example, the workman employed by a piano
maker is a productive labourer.  His labour not only
replaces the wages that he consumes, but in the product, the
piano, the commodity which the piano maker sells, there is a
surplus-value over and above the value of the wages. 
But assume on the contrary that I buy all the materials
required for a piano (or for all it matters the labourer
himself may possess them), and that instead of buying the
piano in a shop I have it made for me in my house.  The
workman who makes the piano is now an unproductive labourer,
because his labour is exchanged directly against my
revenue.</p>
<p><a id="s4"> </a></p>
<h3>[4.  Adam Smith’s Second Explanation: the View of
Productive Labour as Labour Which Is Realised in a
Commodity]</h3>
<p>It is however clear that in the same measure as capital
subjugates to itself the whole of production—that is
to say, that all commodities are produced for the market and
not for immediate consumption, and the productivity of
labour rises in this same measure—there will also
develop more and more a material difference between
productive and unproductive labourers, inasmuch as the
former, apart from minor exceptions, will exclusively
produce <i>commodities</i>, which the latter, with minor
exceptions, will perform only personal services.  Hence
the former class will produce immediate, material wealth
consisting of <i>commodities</i>, all commodities except
those which consist of labour-power itself.  This is
one of the aspects which lead Adam Smith to put forward
other points of difference, in addition to the first and in
principle determining specific difference between productive
and unproductive labour.  Thus, following through
various associations of ideas, he says:</p>
<p class="quote">“The labour of a menial
servant” (as distinct from that of a manufacturer)
“<i>adds to the value of nothing</i> … the
maintenance of a menial servant <i>never is
restored</i>.  A man grows rich by employing a
multitude of manufacturers; he grows poor, by maintaining a
multitude of menial servants.  The <i>labour of the
latter</i>, however, <i>has its value</i>, and deserves its
reward as well as that of the former.  But the labour
of the manufacturer <i>fixes and realises itself in some
particular subject or vendible commodity, which lasts for
some time at least after that labour is past</i>.  It
is, as it were, a certain quantity of labour stocked and
stored up to be employed, if necessary, upon some other
occasion.  That subject, or what is the same thing, the
price of that subject, can afterwards, if necessary, put
into motion a quantity of labour equal to that which had
originally produced it.  The labour of the menial
servant, <span class="context">||307|</span> on the
contrary, <i>does not fix or realise itself in any
particular subject or vendible commodity</i>.  His
<i>services generally perish in the very instant of their
performance</i>, and <i>seldom leave any trace or value
behind them</i>, for which an equal quantity of service
could <i>afterwards</i> be procured.  The labour of
some of the most respectable orders in the society is, like
that of menial servants, <i>unproductive of</i> […]
<i>value</i>, and <i>does not fix or realise itself in any
permanent subject, or vendible commodity</i>” (l.c.,
pp. 93-94 passim).</p>
<p>To define the unproductive labourer we here have the
following determinants, which at the same time reveal the
links in Adam Smith’s train of thought:</p>
<p class="quote">It (the labour of the unproductive
labourer) is “unproductive of […] value”,
“adds to the value of nothing”, “the
maintenance” (of the unproductive labourer)
“never is restored”, “[it] does <i>not
fix</i> or <i>realise itself in any particular subject or
vendible commodity</i>”.  On the contrary,
“his services generally perish in the very instant of
their performance, and seldom leave any trace or value
behind them for which an equal quantity of service could
<i>afterwards</i> be procured”.  Finally, his
labour “does<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">*</a> not
fix or realise itself <i>in any permanent subject or
vendible commodity</i>”.</p>
<p>Here “productive of value” or
“unproductive of value” is used in a different
sense from that in which these terms were used
originally.  The reference is no longer to the
production of a surplus-value, which in itself implies the
reproduction of an equivalent for the value consumed. 
But according to this presentation the labour of a labourer
is called productive in so far as he replaces the consumed
value by an equivalent, by adding to any material, through
his labour, a quantity of value equal to that which was
contained in his wages.  Here the definition by social
form, the determination of productive and unproductive
labourers by their relation to capitalist production, is
abandoned.  From Chapter IX of Book IV (where Adam
Smith criticises the doctrine of the Physiocrats), it can be
seen that he came to make this aberration as a result partly
of his opposition to the Physiocrats and partly under their
influence.  If a labourer merely replaces each year the
equivalent of his wages, then for the capitalist he is not a
productive labourer.  He does indeed replace his wages,
the purchase price of his labour.  But the transaction
is absolutely the same as if this capitalist had bought the
commodity which this labourer produces.  He pays for
the labour contained in the constant capital and in the
wages.  He possesses the same quantity of labour in the
form of the commodity as he had before in the form of
money.  Its money is not thereby transformed into
capital.  In this case it is the same as if the
labourer himself owned his conditions of production. 
He must each year deduct the value of the conditions of
production from the value of his annual product, in order to
replace them.  What he consumed or could consume
annually would be that portion of the value of his product
equal to the new labour added to his constant capital during
the year.  In this case, therefore, it would not be
capitalist production.</p>
<p>The first reason why Adam Smith calls this kind of labour
“productive” is that the Physiocrats call it
“stérile”<a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">*</a> and “nonproductive”. 
<a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4">**</a></p>
<p>Thus Adam Smith tells us in the chapter referred to:</p>
<p class="quote">“First, this class” (namely the
industrial classes, who do not carry on agriculture),
“it is acknowledged “ [by the Physiocrats],
“<i>reproduces annually the value</i> of its own
annual consumption, and <i><span class="stretched">continues, at least, the existence of the
stock or capital which</span> maintains and <span class="stretched">employs it</span></i>… 
Farmers and country labourers, indeed, over and above the
stock which maintains and employs them, reproduce annually a
<i>neat produce</i>, a free rent to the landlord .., the
labour of farmers and country labourers is certainly more
productive than that of merchants, artificers, and
manufacturers.  The superior produce of the one class,
however, does not render the other <i>barren</i> or
<i>unproductive</i>” ([<i>Wealth of Nations</i> O.U.P.
edition, Vol. II, pp. 294-95], [Garnier], l.c., t, III,
p. 530).</p>
<p>Here, therefore, Adam Smith falls back into the
Physiocratic <span class="context">||308|</span>
standpoint.  The real “productive labour”,
which produces a surplus-value and therefore a “neat
produce”, is agricultural labour.  He abandons
his own view of surplus-value and accepts that of the
Physiocrats.  At the same time he asserts, as against
the Physiocrats, that manufacturing (and according to him,
also commercial) labour is nevertheless also productive,
even if not in this highest sense of the word.  He
therefore drops the definition by social form, the
definition of what a “productive labourer” is
from the standpoint of capitalist production; and asserts,
in opposition to the Physiocrats, that the non-agricultural,
industrial class reproduces its own wages, that is, it does
after all produce a value equal to the value it consumes,
and thereby “continues, at least, the existence of the
stock or capital which employs it”.  Hence
arises, under the influence of and in contradiction to the
Physiocrats, his second definition of what is
“productive labour.</p>
<p class="quote">“Secondly,” says Adam Smith,
“it seems, on this account, altogether improper to
consider artificers, manufacturers, and merchants, in the
same light as menial servants.  <i>The labour of menial
servants does not continue the existence of the fund which
maintains and employs them.  Their maintenance and
employment is altogether at the expense of their masters,
and the work which they perform is not of a nature to repay
expense</i>.  That work consists in <i>services</i>
which <i>perish generally in the very instant of their
performance</i>, and <i>does not fix or realise itself in
any vendible commodity, which can replace the value of their
wages and maintenance</i>.  The labour, on the
contrary, of artificers, manufacturers, and merchants,
<i>naturally does fix and realise itself in some such
vendible commodity</i>.  It is up on this account that,
in the chapter in which I treat of <i>productive</i> and
<i>unproductive labour</i>, I have classed artificers,
manufacturers, and merchants among the <i>productive</i>
labourers, and menial servants among the <i>barren</i> or
<i>unproductive</i>” ([ibid., p. 295], [Garnier],
l.c., p. 531).</p>
<p>As soon as capital has mastered the whole of production,
revenue, in so far as it is at all exchanged against labour,
will not be exchanged directly against labour which produces
<i>commodities</i>, but against mere <i>services</i>. 
It is exchanged partly against <i>commodities</i> which are
to serve as use-values, and partly against <i>services</i>,
which as such are consumed as use-values.</p>
<p>A <i>commodity</i>—as distinguished from
labour-power itself—is a material thing confronting
man, a thing of a certain utility for him, in which a
definite quantity of labour is fixed or materialised.</p>
<p>So we come to the definition already in essence contained
in point I: a productive labourer is one whose labour
<i>produces commodities;</i> and indeed such a labourer does
not consume more commodities than he produces, than his
labour costs.  His labour fixes and realises itself
“<i>in some such vendible commodity</i>”,
“<i>in any vendible commodity which can replace the
value of their wages and maintenance</i>”—(that
is, of the workers who produced these commodities).  By
producing commodities the productive worker constantly
reproduces the variable capital which he constantly consumes
in the form of wages.  He constantly produces the fund
which pays him, “which maintains and employs
him”.</p>
<p><i>In the first place.</i>  Adam Smith naturally
includes in the labour which fixes or realises itself in a
vendible and exchangeable commodity all intellectual labours
which are directly consumed in material production. 
Not only the labourer working directly with his hands or a
machine, but overlooker, engineer, manager, clerk,
etc.—in a word, the labour of the whole personnel
required in a particular sphere of material production to
produce a particular commodity, whose joint labour
(co-operation) is required for commodity production. 
In fact they add their aggregate labour to the constant
capital, and increase the value of the product by this
amount.  (How far is this true of bankers, etc.?)</p>
<p><span class="context">||309|</span> <i>Secondly</i>, Adam
Smith says that on the whole, “generally”, this
is not the case with the labour of unproductive
labourers.  Even though capital has conquered material
production, and so by and large home industry has
disappeared, and the industry of the small craftsman who
makes use-values directly for the consumer at his home
—even then, Adam Smith knows quite well, a seamstress
whom I get to come to my house to sew shirts, or workmen who
repair furniture, or the servant who scrubs and cleans the
house, etc., or the cook who gives meat and other things
their palatable form, fix their labour in a thing and in
fact increase the value of these things in exactly the same
way as the seamstress who sews in a factory, the engineer
who repairs the machine, the labourers who clean the
machine, or the cook who cooks in a hotel as the
wage-labourer of a capitalist.  These use-values are
also, potentially, commodities; the shirts may be sent to
the pawnshop, the house resold, the furniture put up to
auction, and so on.  Thus these persons have
potentially also produced commodities and added value to the
objects on which they have worked.  But this is a very
small category among unproductive workers, and does not
apply either to the mass of menial servants or to parsons,
government officials, soldiers, musicians and so on.</p>
<p>But however large or small the number of these
“unproductive labourers” may be, this much at
any rate is evident—and is admitted by the limitation
expressed in the phrase “services which perish
<i>generally</i> in the very instant of their
performance”, etc.— that neither the special
kind of labour nor the external form of its product
necessarily make it “productive” or
“unproductive”.  The same labour can be
productive when I buy it as a capitalist, as a producer, in
order to create more value, and unproductive when I buy it
as a consumer, a sender of revenue, in order to consume its
use-value, no matter whether this use-value perishes with
the activity of the labour-power itself or materialises and
fixes itself in an object.</p>
<p>The cook in the hotel produces a commodity for the person
who as a capitalist has bought her labour—the hotel
proprietor; the consumer of the mutton chops has to pay for
her labour, and this labour replaces for the hotel
proprietor (apart from profit) the fund out of which he
continues to pay the cook.  On the other hand if I buy
the labour of a cook for her to cook meat, etc., for me, not
to make use of it as labour in general but to enjoy it, to
use it as that particular concrete kind of labour, then her
labour is unproductive, in spite of the fact that this
labour fixes itself in a material product and could just as
well (in its result) be a vendible commodity, as it in fact
is for the hotel proprietor.  The great difference (the
conceptual difference) however remains: the cook does not
replace for me (the private person) the fund from which I
pay her, because I buy her labour not as a value-creating
element but purely for the sake of its use-value.  Her
labour as little replaces for me the fund with which I pay
for it, that is, her wages, as, for example, the dinner I
eat in the hotel in itself enables me to buy and eat the
same dinner again a second time.  This distinction
however is also to be found between commodities.  The
commodity which the capitalist buys to replace his constant
capital (for example, cotton material, if he is a cotton
printer) replaces its value in the printed cotton.  But
if on the other hand he buys it in order to consume the
cotton itself, then the commodity does not replace his
outlay.</p>
<p>The largest part of society, that is to say the working
class, must incidentally perform this kind of labour for
itself; but it is only able to perform it when it has
laboured “productively”.  It can only cook
meat for itself when it has produced a wage with which to
pay for the meat; and it can only keep its furniture and
dwellings clean, it can only polish its boots, when it has
produced the value of furniture, house rent and boots. 
To this class of productive labourers itself, therefore, the
labour which they perform for themselves appears as
“unproductive labour”.  This unproductive
labour never enables them <span class="context">||310|</span> to repeat the same
unproductive labour a second time unless they have
previously laboured productively.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly.</i>  On the other hand: an entrepreneur
of theatres, concerts, brothels, etc., buys the temporary
disposal over the labour-power of the actors, musicians,
prostitutes, etc.—in fact in a roundabout way that is
only of formal economic interest; in its result the process
is the same—he buys this so-called “unproductive
labour”, whose “services perish in the very
instant of their performance and do not fix or realise
themselves “any permanent”
(“particular” is also used) “subject or
vendible commodity” (apart from themselves).  The
sale of these to the public provides him with wages and
profit.  And these services which he has thus bought
enable him to buy them again; that is to say, they
themselves renew the fund from which they are paid
for.  The same is true for example of the labour of
clerks employed by a lawyer in his office—except for
the fact that these services as a rule also embody
themselves in very bulky “particular subjects”
in the form of immense bundles of documents.</p>
<p>It is true that these services are paid for to the
entrepreneur out of the revenue of the public.  But it
is no less true that this holds good of all products in so
far as they enter into individual consumption.  It is
true that the country cannot export these services as such;
but it can export those who perform the services.  Thus
France exports dancing masters, cooks, etc., and Germany
schoolmasters.  With the export of the dancing master,
or the schoolmaster, however, his revenue is also exported,
while the export of dancing shoes and books brings a return
to the country.</p>
<p>If therefore on the one hand a part of the so-called
unproductive labour embodies itself in material use-values
which might just as well be commodities (vendible
commodities), so on the other hand a part of the services in
the strict sense which assume no objective form—which
do not receive an existence as things separate from those
performing the services, and do not enter into a commodity
as a component part of its value—may be bought with
capital (by the <i>immediate</i> purchaser of the labour),
may replace their own wages and yield a profit for
him.  In short, the production of these services can be
in part subsumed under capital, just as a part of the labour
which embodies itself in useful things is bought directly by
revenue and is not subsumed under capitalist production.</p>
<p><i>Fourthly.</i>  The whole world of
“commodities” can be divided into two great
parts.  First, labour-power; second, commodities as
distinct from labour-power itself.  As to the purchase
of such services as those which train labour-power, maintain
or modify it, etc., in a word, give it a specialised form or
even only maintain it—thus for example the
schoolmaster’s service, in so far as it is
“industrially necessary” or useful; the doctor’s
service in so far as he maintains health and so conserves
the source of all values, labour-power itself—these
are services which yield in return “a vendible
commodity, etc.”, namely labour-power itself, into
whose costs of production or reproduction these services
enter.  Adam Smith knew however how little
“education’ enters into the costs of production
of the mass of working men.  And in any case the
doctor’s services belong to the <i>faux frais</i><a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5">*</a> of production. 
They can be counted as the cost of repairs for
labour-power.  Let us assume that wages and profit fell
simultaneously in total value, from whatever cause (for
example, because the nation had grown lazier), and at the
same time in use value (because labour had become less
productive owing to bad harvests, etc.), in a word, that the
part of the product whose value is equal to the revenue
declines, because less new labour has been added in the past
year and because the labour added has been less
productive.  If in such conditions capitalist and workman
wanted to consume the same amount of value in material
things as they did before, they would have to buy less of
the services of the doctor, schoolmaster, etc.  And if
they were compelled to continue the same outlay for both
these services, then they would have to restrict their
consumption of other things It is therefore clear that the
labour of the doctor and the schoolmaster does not directly
create the fund out of which they are paid, although their
labours enter into the production costs of the fund which
creates all values whatsoever—namely, the production
costs of labour-power.</p>
<p><span class="context">||311|</span> Adam Smith
continues:</p>
<p class="quote">“Thirdly, it seems, upon every
supposition, improper to say, that the labour of artificers,
manufacturers, and merchants, does not increase the <i>real
revenue</i> of the society.  Though we should suppose,
for example, as it seems to be supposed in this system, that
the value of the daily, monthly, and yearly consumption of
this class was exactly equal to that of its daily, monthly,
and yearly production; yet it would not from thence follow,
that its labour added nothing to the real revenue, to the
real value of the annual produce of the land and labour of
the society.  An artificer, for example, who, in the
first six months after harvest, executes ten pounds worth of
work, though he should, in the same time, consume ten pounds
worth of corn, and other necessaries, yet really adds the
value of ten pounds to the annual produce of the land and
labour of the society.  While he has been consuming a
half-yearly revenue of ten pounds worth of corn and other
necessaries, he has produced an equal value of work, capable
of purchasing, either to himself, or to some other person,
an equal half-yearly revenue.  The value, therefore, of
what has been consumed and produced during these six months,
is equal, not to ten, but to twenty pounds.  It is
possible, indeed, that no more than ten pounds worth of this
value may ever have existed at any one moment of time. 
But if the ten pounds worth of corn and other necessaries
which were consumed by the artificer, had been consumed by a
soldier, or by a menial servant, the value of that part of
the annual produce which existed at the and of the six
months, would have been ten pounds less than it actually is
in consequence of the labour of the artificer.  Though
the value of what the artificer produces, therefore, should
not, at any one moment of time, be supposed greater than the
value he consumes, yet, at every moment of time, the
actually existing value of goods in the market is, in
consequence of what he produces, greater than it otherwise
would be” ([<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, O.U.P. edition,
Vol. II, pp. 295-96], [Garnier], l.c., t. III,
pp. 531-33).</p>
<p>Is not the [total] value of the commodities at any time
in the market greater as a result of the “unproductive
labour” than it would no without this labour? 
Are there not at every moment of time in the market,
alongside wheat and meat, etc., also prostitutes, lawyers,
sermons, concerts, theatres, soldiers, politicians,
etc.?  These lads or wenches do not get the corn and
other necessaries or pleasures for nothing.  In return
they give or pester us with their services, which as such
services have a use-value and because of their production
costs also an exchange-value.  Reckoned as consumable
articles, there is at every moment of time, alongside the
consumable articles existing in the form of goods, a
quantity of consumable articles in the form of
services.  The total quantity of consumable articles is
therefore at every moment of time greater than it would be
without the consumable services.  Secondly, however,
the value too is greater; for it is equal to the value of
the commodities which are given for these services, and is
equal to the value of the services themselves.  Since
here, as in every exchange of commodity for commodity, equal
value is given for equal value, the same value is therefore
present twice over, once on the buyer’s side and once on the
seller’s.</p>
<p>&lt;Adam Smith goes on to say in reference to the
Physiocrats:</p>
<p class="quote">“When the patrons of this system
assert, that the <i>consumption</i> of artificers,
manufacturers, and merchants, is <i>equal to the value of
what they produce</i>, they probably mean no more than that
their <i>revenue, or the fund destined for their
consumption, is equal to it</i>” (that is, to the
value of what they produce) ([ibid., p. 296], [Garnier]
l.c., p. 533).</p>
<p>In this the Physiocrats were right in relation to workmen
and employers taken together, rent forming only a special
category of the latter’s profit.&gt;</p>
<p><span class="context">||312|</span> &lt;<i>Adam Smith</i>
notes on the same occasion—that is, in his criticism
of the Physiocrats—Book IV, Chapter IX (edit. Garnier,
t. III):</p>
<p class="quote">“The annual produce of the land and
labour of any society can he augmented only in two ways;
either, <i>first</i>, by some <i>improvement in the
productive powers of the useful labour</i> actually
maintained within it; or, <i>secondly, by some increase in
the quantity of that labour</i>.  The improvement in
the productive powers of useful labour depends, first,
<i>upon the improvement in the ability of the workman;</i>
and, secondly, <i>upon that of tire machinery with which he
works</i>…  <i>The increase in the quantity of
useful labour</i> actually employed within any society must
depend altogether upon <i>the increase of tire capital which
employs it;</i> and <i>the increase of that capitol</i>, a
<i>must be exactly equal to the amount of the savings</i>
from the revenue, either of the particular persons who
manage and direct the employment of that capital, or of some
other persons, who lend it to them” ([ibid., p. 297],
[Garnier], pp. 534-35).</p>
<p>Here we have a double vicious circle.  <i>First:</i>
the annual product is augmented by greater productivity of
labour.  All means to augment this productivity (in so
far as this is not due to accidents of nature such as a
specially favourable season, etc.) require an increase of
capital.  But in order to increase the capital, the
annual product of labour must be increased.  First
circle.  <i>Secondly:</i> the annual product can be
augmented by an increase in the quantity of labour
employed.  The quantity of labour employed, however,
can only be increased if the capital which employs it is
first increased.  Second circle.  Adam Smith helps
himself out of both vicious circles with
“<i>savings</i>”, by which he means in fact the
transformation of revenue into capital.</p>
<p>To think of the whole profit as “revenue” for
the capitalist is already in itself wrong.  The law of
capitalist production requires on the contrary that a part
of the surplus-labour, of the unpaid labour, performed by
the workman should be transformed into capital.  When
the individual capitalist functions as a
capitalist—that is, as a functionary of
capital—he himself may think of this as saving; but it
also appears to him as a necessary reserve fund.  The
increase of the quantity of labour does not however depend
only on the number of workmen, but also on the length of the
working-day.  The quantity of labour can therefore be
increased without increasing the part of the capital that is
converted into wages.  Similarly, on this assumption
there would be no need to increase the machinery, etc.
(although it would wear out more quickly; but this makes no
difference).  The only thing that would have to be
increased is the part of the raw material that resolves
itself into seed, etc.  And it remains true that,
taking a single country (excluding foreign trade),
surplus-labour must first be applied to agriculture before
it becomes possible in the industries which get their raw
materials from agriculture.  A part of these raw
materials, such as coal, iron, wood, fish, etc. (the
last-named for example as manure), in a word, all
fertilisers other than animal manures, can be got by merely
increasing the labour (the number of labourers remaining the
same).  There can therefore be no lack of these. 
On the other hand it has been shown above that the increase
of productivity in its origin always presupposes merely the
concentration of capital, not the accumulation of
capital.  Later however each process supplements the
other.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;The reason why the Physiocrats preached <i>laissez
faire, laissez passer</i>, in short, free competition, is
correctly stated in the following passages from Adam
Smith:</p>
<p class="quote">“The trade which is carried on
between these two different sets of people” (country
and town) “consists ultimately in a certain quantity
of rude produce exchanged for a certain quantity of
manufactured produce.  The dearer the latter,
therefore, the cheaper the former; and whatever tends in any
country to raise the price of manufactured produce, tends to
lower that of the rude produce of the land, and thereby to
discourage agriculture.”</p>
<p>But all fetters and restrictions placed on manufactures
and foreign trade make manufactured commodities, etc.,
dearer.  Therefore, etc.  (Smith, [ibid., p.308]
[Garnier trans], l.c., pp. 554-56).</p>
<h4>***</h4>
<p><span class="context">||313|</span> Smith’s second view
of “productive” and “unproductive
labour”—or rather the view that is interwoven
with his other view—therefore amounts to this: that
the former is labour which produces <i>commodities</i>, and
the latter is labour which does not produce “any
commodity”.  He does not deny that the one kind
of labour, equally with the other, <i>is a
commodity</i>.  See above: “The labour of the
latter …has its value, and deserves its reward as
well as that of the former” (that is, from the
economic standpoint; there is no question of moral or other
standpoints in the case of either the one or the other kind
of labour).  The concept commodity however implies that
labour embodies, materialises, realises itself in its
product.  Labour itself, in its immediate being, in its
living existence, cannot be directly conceived as a
commodity, but only labour-power, of which labour itself is
the temporary manifestation.  Just as it is only in
this way that wage-labour in the true sense can be
explained, so it is with “unproductive labour”,
which Adam Smith throughout defines by the costs of
production required to produce the “unproductive
labourer”.  A <i>commodity</i> must therefore be
conceived as something different from labour itself. 
Then, however, the world of commodities is divided into two
great categories:</p>
<p>On one side, labour-power.</p>
<p>On the other side, commodities themselves.</p>
<p>The materialisation, etc., of labour is however not to be
taken in such a Scottish sense as Adam Smith conceives
it.  When we speak of the commodity as a
materialisation of labour—in the sense of its
exchange-value—this itself is only an imaginary, that
is to say, a purely social mode of existence of the
commodity which has nothing to do with its corporeal
reality; it is conceived as a definite quantity of social
labour or of money.  It may be that the concrete labour
whose result it is leaves no trace in it.  In
manufactured commodities this trace remains in the outward
form given to the raw material.  In agriculture, etc.,
although the form given to the commodity, for example wheat
or oxen and so on, is also the product of human labour, and
indeed of labour transmitted and added to from generation to
generation, yet this is not evident in the product.  In
other forms of industrial labour the purpose of the labour
is not at all to alter the form of the thing, but only its
position.  For example, when a commodity is brought
from China to England, etc., no trace of the labour involved
can be seen in the thing itself (except for those who call
to mind that it is not an English product).  Therefore
the materialisation of labour in the commodity must not be
understood in that way.  (The mystification here arises
from the fact that a social relation appears in the form of
a thing).</p>
<p>It remains true, however, that the commodity appears as
past, objectivised labour, and that therefore, if it does
not appear in the form of a thing, it can only appear in the
form of labour-power itself; but never directly as living
labour itself (except only in a roundabout way which in
practice seems the same, but whose significance lies in the
determination of different rates of wages).  Productive
labour would therefore be such labour as produces
commodities or directly produces, trains, develops,
maintains or reproduces labour-power itself.  Adam
Smith excludes the latter from his category of productive
labour; arbitrarily, but with a certain correct
instinct—that if he included it, this would open the
flood-gates for false pretensions to the title of productive
labour.</p>
<p>In so far therefore as we leave labour-power itself out
of account, productive labour is labour which produces
commodities, material products, whose production has cost a
definite quantity of labour or labour-time.  These
material products include all products of art and science,
books, paintings, statues, etc., in so far as they take the
form of things.  In addition, however, the product of
labour must be a <i>commodity</i> in the sense of being
“some vendible commodity”, that is to say, a
commodity in its first form, which has still to pass through
its metamorphosis.  (A manufacturer may himself
construct a machine if he cannot get one built anywhere
else, not to sell it but to make use of it as a
use-value.  However, he then wears it out as a part of
his constant capital and so sells it piecemeal in the form
of the product which it has helped to make.)</p>
<p><span class="context">||314|</span> Certain labours of
menial servants may therefore equally well take the form of
(potential) <i>commodities</i> and even of the same
use-values considered as material objects.  But they
are not productive labour, because in fact they produce not
“commodities” but immediate
“<i>use-values</i>”.  As for labours which
are productive for their purchaser or employer
himself—as for example the actor’s labour for the
theatrical entrepreneur—the fact that their purchaser
cannot sell them to the public in the form of commodities
but only in the form of the action itself would show that
they are unproductive labours.</p>
<p>Apart from such cases, productive labour is such as
produces <i>commodities</i>, and <i>unproductive labour</i>
is such as produces personal services.  The former
labour is represented in a vendible thing; the latter must
be consumed while it is being performed.  The former
includes (except for that labour which creates labour-power
itself) all material and intellectual wealth—meat as
well as books—that exists in the form of things; the
latter covers all labours which satisfy any imaginary or
real need of the individual—or even those which are
forced upon the individual against his will.</p>
<p>The <i>commodity</i> is the most elementary form of
bourgeois wealth.  The explanation of “productive
labour” as labour which produces
“commodities” also corresponds, therefore, to a
much more elementary point of view than that which defines
productive labour as labour which produces capital.</p>
<p>Adam Smith’s opponents have disregarded his first,
pertinent definition, and instead have concentrated on the
second, pointing out the unavoidable contradictions and
inconsistencies to which it gives rise.  And their
attacks were made all the easier for them by their
insistence on the material content of the labour, and
particularly the specific requirement that the labour must
fix itself in a more or less <i>permanent</i> product. 
We shall see in a moment what it was that particularly gave
rise to the polemics.</p>
<p>But first this further point.  Adam Smith says of
the Physiocratic system that its great merit is that it
represented the wealth of nations as consisting</p>
<p class="quote">“not in the unconsumable riches of
money, but in the consumable goods annually produced by the
labour of the society”( [<i>Wealth of Nations</i>,
O.U.P. edition, p. 299], [Garnier] t. III, l. IV, ch. IX,
p. 538).</p>
<p>Here we have a deduction of his second definition of
productive labour.  The definition of surplus-value
naturally depended on the form in which value itself was
conceived.  In the Monetary and Mercantile systems it
is therefore presented as <i>money;</i> by the Physiocrats,
as the produce of the land, as agricultural product; finally
in Adam Smith’s writings as <i>commodity</i> in
general.  In so far as the Physiocrats touch on the
substance of value, they resolve it entirely into pure
use-value (matter, corporeal object), just as the
Mercantilists resolve it into the pure form of value, the
form in which the product <i>makes itself manifest</i> as
general social labour: money.  With Adam Smith, both
conditions of the commodity—use-value and
exchange-value—are combined; and so all labour is
productive which manifests itself in any use-value, any
useful product.  That it is labour that manifests
itself in the product already implies that the product is
equal to a definite quantity of general social labour. 
As against the Physiocrats, Adam Smith re-establishes the
value of the product as the essential basis of bourgeois
wealth; but on the other hand he divests value of the purely
fantastic form—that of gold and silver—in which
it appeared to the Mercantilists.  Every commodity is
<i>in itself</i> money.  It must be recognised that at
the same time Adam Smith also falls back more or less into
the Mercantilist conception of
“permanency”—in fact,
inconsumability.  We can recall the passage in Petty
(see my first volume, p. 109, where I quote from Petty’s
<i>Political Arithmetick</i>) where wealth is valued
according to the degrees in which it is imperishable, more
or less permanent, and finally gold and silver are set above
all other things as wealth that is “not
perishable”.</p>
<p>Adolphe Blanqui (<i>Histoire de l’économie
politique</i>, Bruxelles, 1839, p.152) says [of Adam
Smith]:</p>
<p class="quote">“In restricting the sphere of
<i>wealth</i> exclusively to those values which are embodied
in material substances, he erased from the book of
production the whole boundless mass of immaterial values,
daughters of the <i>moral capital</i> of civilised
nations,” etc.</p>
<p><a id="s5"> </a></p>
<h3>[5.  Vulgarisation of Bourgeois Political Economy in
the Definition of Productive Labour]</h3>
<p>The polemics against Adam Smith’s distinction between
productive and unproductive labour were for the most part
confined to the <i>dii minorum gentium</i><a href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6">*</a> (among
whom moreover Storch was the most important); they are not
to be found in the work of any economist <span class="context">||315|</span> of significance—of
anyone of whom it can be said that he made some discovery in
political economy.  They are, however, the hobby-horse
of the second-rate fellows and especially of the
schoolmasterish compilers and writers of compendia, as well
as of <i>dilettanti</i> with facile pens and vulgarisers in
this field.  What particularly aroused these polemics
against Adam Smith was the following circumstance.</p>
<p>The great mass of so-called “higher grade”
workers—such as state officials, military people,
artists, doctors, priests, judges, lawyers, etc.—some
of whom are not only not productive but in essence
destructive, but who know how to appropriate to themselves a
very great part of the “material” wealth partly
through the sale of their “immaterial”
commodities and partly by forcibly imposing the latter on
other people—found it not at all pleasant to be
relegated <i>economically</i> to the same class as clowns
and menial servants and to appear merely as people partaking
in the consumption, parasites on the actual producers (or
rather agents of production).  This was a peculiar
profanation precisely of those functions which had hitherto
been surrounded with a halo and had enjoyed superstitious
veneration.  Political economy in its classical period,
like the bourgeoisie itself in its <i>parvenu</i> period,
adopted a severely critical attitude to the machinery of the
State, etc.  At a later stage it realised and—as
was shown too in practice—learnt from experience that
the necessity for the inherited social combination of all
these classes, which in part were totally unproductive,
arose from its own organisation.</p>
<p>In so far as those “unproductive labourers”
do not produce entertainment, so that their purchase
entirely depends on how the agent of production cares to
spend his wages or his profit—in so far on the
contrary as they are necessary or make themselves necessary
because of physical infirmities (like doctors), or spiritual
weakness (like parsons), or because of the conflict between
private interests and national interests (like statesmen,
all lawyers, police and soldiers)—they are regarded by
Adam Smith, as by the industrial capitalists themselves and
the working class, as incidental expenses of production,
which are therefore to be cut down to the most indispensable
minimum and provided as cheaply as possible.  Bourgeois
society reproduces in its own form everything against which
it had fought in feudal or absolutist form.  In the
first place therefore it becomes a principal task for the
sycophants of this society, and especially of the upper
classes, to restore in theoretical terms even the purely
parasitic section of these “unproductive
labourers”, or to justify the exaggerated claims of
the section which is indispensable.  The
<i>dependence</i> of the ideological, etc., classes on the
<i>capitalists</i> was in fact proclaimed.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, however, a section of the agents of
production (of material production itself) were declared by
one group of economists or another to be
“unproductive”.  For example, the
landowner, by those among the economists who represented
industrial capital (Ricardo).  Others (for example
Carey) declared that the merchant in the true sense of the
word was an “unproductive” labourer.  Then
even a third group came along who declared that the
“capitalists” themselves were unproductive, or
who at least sought to reduce their claims to material
wealth to “wages”, that is, to the wages of a
“productive labourer”.  Many intellectual
workers seemed inclined to share the scepticism in regard to
the capitalist.  It was therefore time to make a
compromise and to recognise the “productivity”
of all classes not directly included among the agents of
material production.  One good turn deserves another;
and, as in the <i>Fable of the Bees</i>, it had to be
established that even from the “productive”,
economic standpoint, the bourgeois world with all its
“unproductive labourers” is the best of all
worlds.  This was all the more necessary because the
“unproductive labourers” on their part were
advancing critical observations in regard to the
productivity of the classes who in general were
“<i>fruges consumere nati</i>”<a href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7">*</a>;
or in regard to those agents of production, like landowners,
who do nothing at all, etc.  Both the
<i>do-nothings</i> and their <i>parasites</i> had to be
found a place in this best possible order of things.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly:</i> As the dominion of capital extended, and
in fact those spheres of production not directly related to
the production of material, wealth became also more and more
dependent on it— especially when the positive science
(natural sciences) were subordinated to it as serving
material production— <span class="context">||316|</span> the sycophantic underlings of
political economy felt it their duty to glorify and justify
every sphere of activity by demonstrating that it was
“linked” with the production of material wealth,
that it was a means towards it; and they honoured everyone
by making him a “productive labourer” in the
“primary” sense, namely, a labourer who labours
in the service of capital, is useful in one way or another
to the enrichment of the capitalist, etc.</p>
<p>In this matter even such people as Malthus are to be
preferred, who directly defend the necessity and usefulness
of “<i>unproductive</i> labourers” and pure
parasites.</p>

<h3>[6.  Advocates of Smith’s Views on Productive
Labour.  On the History of the Subject]</h3>
<p><a id="s6a"> </a></p>
<h4>[(a) Advocates of the First View: Ricardo, Sismondi]</h4>
<p>It is not worth the trouble to examine in detail the
inanities of Germain Garnier (Smith’s translator), the Earl
of Lauderdale, Brougham, Say, Storch, and later Senior,
Rossi, and so on, in regard to this question.  We shall
cite only a few characteristic passages.</p>
<p>But first a passage from <i>Ricardo</i>, in which he
shows that it is much more advantageous for the
“productive labourers” when the owners of
surplus-value (profit, rent) consume it in
“unproductive labourers” (as menial servants,
for instance) than in luxury products produced by the
“productive labourers.</p>
<p>&lt;<i>Sismondi, Nouveaux principes</i>, t. I, p. 148,
accepts the correct statement of Smith’s distinction (as
also of course does Ricardo): the real distinction between
productive and unproductive classes is:</p>
<p class="quote">“The one always exchanges its labour
against the capital of a nation; the other always exchanges
it against a part of the national revenue.”</p>
<p><i>Sismondi</i>—likewise following Adam
Smith—on surplus-value:</p>
<p class="quote">“Although the labourer, by his daily
labour, may have produced much more than his daily outlay,
after sharing with the landowner and the capitalist what
remains for him is seldom much beyond what is strictly
necessary for his existence” (Sismondi, <i>Nouveaux
principes</i>, etc., t. I, p. 87).</p>
<p>Ricardo says:</p>
<p class="quote">“If a landlord, or a capitalist,
expends his revenue in the manner of an ancient baron, in
the support of a great number of retainers, or menial
servants, he will give employment to much more labour, than
if he expended it on fine clothes, or costly furniture; on
carriages, on horses, or in the purchase of any other
luxuries.  In both cases the net revenue would be the
same, and so would he the gross revenue, but the former
would be realised in different commodities.  If my
revenue were 10,000 <i>l</i>., the same quantity nearly of
productive labour would be employed, whether I realised it
in fine clothes and costly furniture, etc.,etc,, or in a
quantity of food and clothing of the same value.  If,
however, I realised my revenue in the first set of
commodities no more labour would be <i>consequently</i>
employed:— I should enjoy my furniture and my clothes,
and there would be an end of them; but if I realised my
revenue in food and clothing, and my desire was to employ
menial servants, all those whom I could so employ with my
revenue of 10,000 <i>l</i>., or with the food and clothing
which it would purchase, <i>would be to be added to
the former demand for labourers</i>, and this addition would
take place only because I chose this mode of expending my
revenue.  As the labourers, then, are interested in
<i>the demand for labour</i>, they must naturally desire
that as much of the revenue as possible should be diverted
from expenditure on luxuries, to be expended in the support
of menial servants” ([David ] Ricardo, [<i>On the]
Principles [of Political Economy, and Taxation</i>,] third
edition, [London,] 1821, pp. 475-76).</p>
<p><a id="s6b"> </a></p>
<h4>[(b) Early Attempts to Distinguish between Productive and
Unproductive Labour (D’Avenant, Petty)]</h4>
<p><i>D’Avenant</i> quotes from an old statistician, Gregory
King, a list entitled <i>Scheme of the Income and Expense of
the Several Families of England, calculated for the year
1688</i>.  In this, the erudite King divides the whole
nation into two main classes: “<i>Increasing</i> the
Wealth of the Kingdom—2,675,520 heads”, and
“<i>Decreasing</i> the Wealth of the
Kingdom—2,825,000 heads”; thus the former is the
“productive” class, the latter the
“unproductive”.  The
“<i>productive</i>” class consists of Lords,
Baronets, Knights, Esquires, Gentlemen, Persons in Office
and Places, merchants in oversea trade, Persons in the Law,
Clergymen, freeholders, farmers, persons in liberal arts and
sciences, shopkeepers and tradesmen, artisans and
handicrafts, Naval Officers, Military Officers.  As
against these, the “<i>unproductive</i>” class
consists of: common seamen, labouring people and out
servants (these are agricultural labourers and day
wage-labourers in manufacture), cottagers (who in
D’Avenant’s time were still a fifth of the total English
population), <span class="context">||317|</span> common
soldiers, paupers, gipsies, thieves, beggars and vagrants
generally.  D’Avenant explains this list of ranks
prepared by the learned King as follows:</p>
<p class="quote">“By which he means, That the First
Class of the People, from Land, Arts and Industry, maintain
themselves, and add every Year something to the Nation’s
General Stock; and besides this, out of their Superfluity,
contribute every Year so much to the maintenance of
Others.  That of the Second Class, some partly maintain
themselves by Labour […] but that the rest, as most
of the Wives and Children of these, […] are nourish’d
at the Cost of Others; and are a Yearly Burthen to the
Publick, consuming Annuallv so much as would be otherwise
added to the Nation’s General Stock” (D’Avenant, <i>An
Essay upon the Probable Methods of Making a People Gainers
in the Ballance of Trade</i>, London, 1699, p. 50).</p>
<p>In addition to this, the following passage from D’Avenant
is rather characteristic of the views of the Mercantilists
on surplus-value:</p>
<p class="quote">It is “… the Exportation of our own Product that
must make England rich; to he Gainers in the Ballance of
Trade, we must carry out of our own Product, what will
purchase the Things of Foreign Growth that are needful for
our own Consumption, with some <i>Overplus either</i> in
Bullion or Goods to he sold in other Countries; <i>which
Overplus</i> is the <i>Profit a Nation makes by Trade</i>,
and it is more or less according to the natural Frugality of
the People that Export,” (a frugality which the Dutch
have, but not the English—l.c., pp. 46-47) “or
as from the low Price of Labour and Manufacture they can
afford the Commodity cheap, and at <i>a rate not to be
under-sold in Foreign Markets</i>” (D’Avenant, l.c.,
pp. 45-46).</p>
<p class="quote">&lt;“… by what is Consum’d at
Home, one loseth only what another gets, and the Nation in
General is not at all the Richer; but all Foreign
Consumption is a clear and certain Profit” (<i>An
Essay on the East-India Trade</i>, etc., London,
1697).  [In D’Avenant, <i>Discourses on the Publick
Revenues, and on the Trade of England</i>… Part II,
London, 1698, p. 31.]&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;This work <i>printed in the form of an appendix</i>
to another work of D’Avenant’s, which he tries to defend, is
not the same as the <i>Considerations on the East-India
Trade</i>, 1701, quoted by McCulloch.&gt;</p>
<p>Incidentally, it must not be thought that these
Mercantilists were as stupid as they were made out to be by
the later Vulgar-Freetraders.  In Volume II of his
<i>Discourses on the Publick Revenues, and on the Trade of
England</i>, etc., <i>London, 1698</i>, D’Avenant says among
other things:</p>
<p class="quote">“Gold and Silver are indeed the
Measure of Trade, but the Spring and Original of it, in all
Nations, is the Natural, or Artificial Product of the
Country, that is to say, what their Land, or what their
labour and Industry produces.  And this is so true,
that a Nation may be suppos’d, by some Accident, quite
without the Species of Money, and yet, if the People are
numerous, industrious, vers’d in Traffick, skill’d in
Sea-Affairs, and if they have good Ports, and a Soil fertile
in variety<a href="#_ftn8" id="_ftnref8">*</a> of
Commodities, such a people will have Trade, […] and,
they shall quickly get among ‘em, a plenty of Gold and
Silver<a href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9">**</a>: So that the
real and effective Riches of a Country, is its Native
Product” (p.45).  “Gold and Silver are so
far from being […] the only Things that deserve the
name of Treasure, or the Riches of a Nation that in truth,
Money is at Bottom no more than the Countries with which Men
in their dealings have been accustom’d to reckon
(p. 46).  “We understand that to be Wealth which
maintains the Prince, and the general Body of his People, in
Plenty, Ease and Safety.  We esteem that to be Treasure
which for the use of Man has been converted from Gold and
Silver, into Buildings and Improvements of the
Country.  As also other Things <i>convertible</i> into
those Metals, as the Fruits of the Earth, Manufactures or
Foreign Commodities and stock of Shipping … even
perishable Goods, may be he1d the Riches of a Nation, if
they are <i>convertible</i>, tho’not <i>converted</i> into
Gold and Silver; and this we believe does not only hold
between Man and Man, […] but between one Country and
another” (pp. 60-64).  “The Common People
being the Stomach of the Body Politick, […] that
Stomach” in Spain did not take the money as it should
have done, <span class="context">||318|</span> and failed to
digest it.  … “Trade and Manufactures are
the only Mediums by which such a digestion and distribution
of Gold and Silver can be made, as will be Nutritive to the
Body Politick” (pp. 62-63).</p>
<p>Moreover, Petty too had the conception of <i>productive
labourers</i> (though he also includes soldiers):</p>
<p class="quote">“Husbandmen, Seamen, Soldiers,
Artizans and Merchants, are the very Pillars of any
Common-Wealth: all the other great Professions, <i>do rise
out of the infirmities and miscarriages of these;</i> now
the Seaman is three of these four” (navigator,
merchant, soldier) ([William Petty,] <i>Political
Arithmetick</i>, etc. [in <i>Several Essays in Political
Arithmetick</i>], London, 1699, p. 177). 
“… the Labour of Seamen, and Freight of Ships,
is always of the nature of an Exported Commodity, the
<i>overplus</i> whereof, above what is Imported, brings home
Money, etc.” (p. 179).</p>
<p>In this connection Petty also explains the advantages of
the division of labour:</p>
<p class="quote">“Those who have the command of the
Sea-Trade, may Work at easier Freight with more profit, than
others at greater:” (higher freight charges)
“for a Cloth must be cheaper made, when one”
etc., “another” etc. “so those who command
the Trade of Shipping, can build “ different sorts of
vessels for different purposes, “one sort of vessels
for the turbulent Sea, another for Inland Waters and Rivers
… one sort for War … another for
Burthen”, etc.  … And this
“is” the chief of several Reasons, why the
Hollanders can go at less Freight than their Neighbours,
viz., because they can afford a particular sort of Vessels
for each particular Trade”<a href="#_ftn10" id="_ftnref10">*</a> (l.c., pp. 179-80).</p>
<p>Here too Petty strikes quite a Smithian note when he
continues:</p>
<p class="quote">If taxes are taken from industrialists,
etc., in order to give [money] to those who in general are
occupied in ways “which produce <i>no material
thing</i>, or things of real use and value in the
<i>Commonwealth:</i>  In this case, the Wealth of the
Publick will be diminished:  Otherwise than as such
Exercises, are Recreations and Refreshments of the mind; and
which being moderately used, do qualify and dispose Men to
what in it self is more considerable” (l.c.,
p. 198).  After computing how many people are needed
for industrial work “…The Remainder […]
may safely and without possible prejudice to the
Commonwealth, be employed in the Arts and Exercises of
Pleasure and Ornament: <i>the greatest whereof is the
improvement of natural Knowledge</i>” (l.c.,
p. 199).  “There is much more to be gained by
Manufacture than Husbandry; and by Merchandize than
Manufacture…” (l.c., p. 172). 
“… a Seaman is in effect three
Husbandmen…“ (p. 178).

<h4>***</h4>
<p><span class="context">||VIII-346|</span> <i>Petty,
Surplus-Value. </i> In one passage of Petty’s there can
be seen an anticipation of the nature of
<i>surplus-value</i>, although he treats it only in the form
of rent.  Especially when it is put alongside the
following passage, in which he determines the relative value
of silver and corn by the relative quantities of each that
can be produced in the same labour-time.</p>
<p class="quote">“If a man can bring to London an
ounce of Silver out of the Earth in Peru, in the same time
that he can produce a Bushel of Corn, then one is the
natural price of the other; now if by reason of new and more
easier Mines a man can get two ounces of Silver as easily as
formerly he did one, then Corn will be as cheap at ten
shillings the Bushel, as it was before five shillings,
<i>caeteris paribus</i><a href="#_ftn11" id="_ftnref11">*</a>.”</p>
<p class="quote">“…let a hundred men work ten
years upon Corn, and the same number of men the same time,
upon Silver; I say, that the neat proceed of the Silver is
the price of the whole neat proceed of the Corn, and like
parts of the one, the price of like parts of the
other.”</p>
<p class="quote">“Corn will be twice as dear where<a href="#_ftn12" id="_ftnref12">*</a>* are two hundred
Husbandmen to do the same work which an hundred could
perform…” ( [William Petty], <i>On Taxes and
Contributions</i>, 1662) (in the edit. of 1679, pp. 32, 24,
67).</p>
<p>The passages to which I alluded above are the
following:</p>
<p class="quote">“… as Trades and curious Arts
increase; so the Trade of Husbandry will decrease, or else
the Wages of Husbandmen must rise, and <i>consequently</i>
the Rents of Lands must fall” (p. 193).</p>
<p class="quote">“… if Trade and Manufacture
have increased in England … if a greater part of the
People, apply themselves to those Faculties, than there did
heretofore, and if the price of Corn he no greater now, than
when Husbandmen were more numerous, and the Tradesmen fewer:
it follows from that single reason .., that the Rents of
Land must fall: As for Example, suppose the price of Wheat
be 5s. or 60d. the Bushel; now if the Rent of the Land
whereon it grows be the third Sheaf”; (i.e., part,
share) “then of the 60d. 20d. is for the Land, and
40d, for the Husbandman; but if the Husbandman’s wages
should rise one-eighth part, or from 8d. to 9d. per Diem,<a href="#_ftn13" id="_ftnref13">***</a> then the
Husbandman’s share in the Bushel of Wheat rises from 40d. to
45d. and consequently the Rent of the Land must fall from
20d. to 45d. for we suppose <i>the price of the Wheat still
remains the same;</i> especially <i>since we cannot raise
it</i>, for if we did attempt it, Corn would be brought in
to us, <span class="context">||347|</span> (as into Holland)
from Foreign Parts, where the State of Husbandry was not
changed.” ([William Petty], <i>Political
Arithmetick</i> [in <i>Several Essays in Political
Arithmetick</i>], London, 1699, pp. 493-94.)
|VIII—347||</p>
<h4>***</h4>
<p><span class="context">||VIII-364|</span>
&lt;<i>Petty.</i>  The following passage, where rent in
general is treated as a surplus-value, a net product, should
be compared with the one quoted above from Petty:</p>
<p class="quote">“Suppose a man could with his own
hands plant a certain scope of land with Corn, that is,
could Dig, or Plough: Harrow, Weed, Reap, Carry home,
Thresh, and Winnow so much as the Husbandry of this Land
required […].  I say, that when this man hath
subducted his seed out of the proceed of his Harvest, and
also what himself hath both eaten and given to others in
exchange for Clothes, and other Natural necessaries; that
the Remainder of Corn is the natural and true Rent of the
Land for that year; and the <i>medium</i> of seven years, or
rather of so many years as makes up the Cycle, within which
Dearths and Plenties make their revolution, doth give the
ordinary Rent of the Land in Corn.  But a further,
though collateral question may he, how much <i>English</i>
money this Corn or Rent is worth; I answer so much as the
money, which another single man can save, within the same
time, over and above his expense, if he imployed himself
wholly to produce and make it; viz. Let another man go
travel into a Countrey where is Silver, there Dig it, Refine
it, bring it to the same place where the other man planted
his Corn; Coyne it, etc. the same person, all the while of
his working for Silver, gathering also food for his
necessary livelihood, and procuring himself covering,
etc.  I say, the Silver of the one must he esteemed of
equal value with the Corn of the other”

Petty, <i>A Treatise of Taxes, and

<h4>[(c) John Stuart Mill, an Adherent of Smith’s Second View
of Productive Labour]</h4>
<p><span class="context">||VII-318|</span> Mr. <i>John
Stuart Mill</i>, in <i>Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of
Political Economy</i>, London, 1844, also struggled with the
problem of productive and unproductive labour; but in so
doing he in fact added nothing to Smith’s (second)
definition except that labours which produce labour-power
itself are also productive.</p>
<p class="quote">“<i>Sources of enjoyment</i> may he
accumulated and stored up; enjoyment itself cannot. 
The wealth of a country consists of the sum total of the
permanent sources of enjoyment, whether material or
immaterial, contained in it; and labour or expenditure which
tends to augment or keep up these permanent sources, should,
we conceive, be termed <i>productive</i>” (l.c., p.
82).  “If the mechanic who made the
spinning-jenny laboured productively, the spinner also
laboured productively when he was learning his trade: and
what they both consumed productively, that is to say, its
consumption did not tend to diminish, but to increase the
sum of the permanent sources of enjoyment in the country, by
effecting a new creation of those sources, more than equal
to the amount of the consumption” (l.c., p. 83).</p>

<p>We will now briefly run over the twaddle written against
Adam Smith in connection with productive and unproductive
labour.</p>

<h3>[7.]  Germain Garnier [Vulgarisation of the
Theories Put Forward by Smith and the Physiocrats]</h3>
<p><span class="context">||319|</span> The fifth volume
[contains Garnier’s] Notes to his translation of Smith’s
<i>Wealth of Nations</i> (Paris, 1802).</p>
<p>On “productive labour” in the highest sense
Garnier shares the view of the Physiocrats; he only makes it
somewhat weaker.  He opposes Smith’s view that
“productive labour .., is that which realises itself
in some particular subject or vendible commodity, which
lasts for some time at least after that labour is
past” ([Garnier] 1.c., t. V, p. 169).  <span class="context">|VII-319||</span></p>
<p><a id="s7a"> </a></p>
<h4>[(a) Confusion of Labour which Is Exchanged Against
Capital with Labour Exchanged against Revenue.  The
False Conception that the Total Capital Is Replaced through
the Revenue of the Consumers]</h4>
<p><span class="context">||VIII-347|</span> (<i>Germain
Garnier</i>).  He brings forward various arguments
against Adam Smith (which are in part repeated by later
authors).</p>
<p><i>First</i>.</p>
<p class="quote">“This distinction is false, inasmuch
as it is based on a difference which does not exist. 
<i>All labour is productive</i> in the sense in which the
author uses this word <i>productive</i>, The labour of the
one as of the other of these two classes is equally
productive of some enjoyment, commodity or utility for the
person who pays for it, otherwise this labour would not find
wages.”</p>
<p>&lt;It is therefore productive because it produces some
use-value and is sold, has an exchange-value, and is thus
itself a commodity.&gt;</p>
<p>In developing this point, however, Garnier cites examples
by way of illustration, in which the “unproductive
labourers” do <i>the same thing</i>, produce the same
use-value or the same kind of use-value as the
“productive”.  For example:</p>
<p class="quote">“The servant who is in my service,
who lights my fire, who dresses my hair, who cleans and
keeps in order my clothes and my furniture, who prepares my
food, etc., performs <i>services absolutely of the same
kind</i> as the laundress or the seamstress who cleans and
keeps in order her customers’ Linen: as the eating-house
keeper, cook-shop proprietor or publican who carries on his
trade of preparing food for persons whom it suits better to
come and dine with him; as the barber, the
hairdresser” (for Adam Smith, however, most of these
fellows are as little reckoned among productive workers as
the servants) “who perform immediate services; finally
as the mason, the tiler, joiner, the glazier, the stove
setter […], etc., and the multitude of building
labourers who come when they are called to carry out
restorations and repairs, and whose annual income depends as
much on simple repair and maintenance work as on new
construction.”</p>
<p>(Adam Smith nowhere says that the labour which fixes
itself in a more or less permanent object cannot be equally
well repairs as the making of new things.)</p>
<p class="quote">“This kind of labour consists less in
producing than in maintaining; its aim is less to add to the
value of the subjects to which it is applied than to prevent
their decay.  All these labourers, including the
servants, so <i>ye the person who pays them the labour of
maintaining his own things</i>… “</p>
<p>(They can therefore be regarded as machines for
maintaining value, or rather use-values.  <i>Destutt de
Tracy</i> also asserts this view of the “saving”
of labour.  See further on.  The unproductive
labour of one does not become productive by saving the other
<i>unproductive labour</i>.  One of the two performs
it.  A part of Adam Smith’s unproductive
labour—but only the part which is absolutely necessary
in order to consume things, which so to speak belongs to the
<i>costs of consumption</i> (and then, too, only when it
saves this time for a productive worker)—becomes
necessary as a result of the division of labour.  But
Adam Smith does not deny this “division of
labour”.  If everyone had to perform productive
and unproductive labour, and through the dividing up of
these kinds of labour between two persons both were better
performed, according to Adam Smith this would in no way
alter the circumstance that one of these labours is
productive and the other unproductive.)</p>
<p class="quote">“It is for that and for that alone
that they most often labour” (for one person to save
the labour of looking after himself, ten have to look after
him—a curious way of “saving” labour;
besides “unproductive labour” of this kind is
most often made use of by those who do nothing);
“thus, either they are all <i>productive</i>, or none
of them is productive” (l.c., p.172).</p>
<p><span class="context">||348|</span>
<i>Secondly.</i>  A Frenchman cannot forget the
<i>ponts et chaussées</i>.<a href="#_ftn14" id="_ftnref14">*</a> Why, he says, call productive</p>
<p class="quote">“the labour of an inspector or
director of a private enterprise in trade or manufacture,
and <i>non-productive</i>, the labour of the government
official who, watching over the upkeep of public highways,
of navigable canals and ports, of monies and other important
instruments destined to enliven commercial activity,
watching over the security of transport and communications,
the carrying out of conventions, etc., can with justice be
regarded as the <i>inspector of the great social
manufacture?</i> It is labour of absolutely the same nature,
though on a vaster scale” (pp. 172-73).</p>
<p>In so far as such a lad takes part in the production (or
conservation and reproduction) of material things which
could be sold were they not in the hands of the State, Smith
might call his labour “productive”. 
“Inspectors of the great social manufacture” are
purely French creations.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>.  Here Garnier falls into
“moralising”.  Why should the
“manufacturer of perfumery, who flatters my sense of
smell”, be productive and not the musician, who
“enchants my ear”?  (p. 173).  Smith
would reply: because the former supplies a material product
and the latter does not.  Morals and the
“merits” of the two lads have nothing to do with
the distinction.</p>
<p><i>Fourthly</i>.  Is it not a contradiction that the
“violin maker, the organ builder, the music dealer,
the mechanic, etc.”, are productive, and the
professions for which these labours are only
“preparations” are unproductive?</p>
<p class="quote">“All of them have, as the final aim
of <i>their labour, a consumption of the same
kind</i>.  If the result which some of them have in
view does not deserve to be counted among <i>the
products</i> of the labour of society, why should one treat
more favourably what is nothing but a <i>means for attaining
this result</i>?”(l.c., p. 173).</p>
<p>On this reasoning, a man who eats corn is just as
productive as the man who produces it.  For with what
aim is corn produced?  In order to eat it.  So if
the labour of eating is not productive, why should the
labour of cultivating corn be productive, since it is only a
means for attaining this aim?  Besides, the man who
eats produces brain, muscles, etc., and are these not just
as worthy products as barley or wheat?—an indignant
friend of humanity might ask Adam Smith.</p>
<p>In the first place, Adam Smith does not deny that the
unproductive labourer produces a product of some sort. 
Otherwise he would not be a labourer at all.  Secondly,
it may seem strange that the doctor who prescribes pills is
not a productive labourer, but the apothecary who makes them
up is.  Similarly the instrument maker who makes the
fiddle, but not the musician who plays it.  But that
would only show that “productive labourers”
produce products which have no purpose except to serve as
means of production for unproductive labourers.  Which
however is no more surprising than that all productive
labourers, when all is said and done, produce firstly the
means for the payment of unproductive labourers, and
secondly, products which are consumed by those who <i>do not
perform any labour</i>.</p>
<p>Of all these comments, No. II is that of a Frenchman who
can’t forget his <i>ponts et chaussées;</i> No. III
amounts only to morals; No. IV either contains the stupidity
that consumption is just as productive as production
&lt;which is not true in bourgeois society, where one
produces and another consumes&gt; or that some productive
labour merely produces the material for unproductive labour,
which Adam Smith nowhere denies.  Only No. I contains
the correct point that Adam Smith, by his second definition,
calls <i>the same</i> kinds of labour <span class="context">||349|</span> productive and
unproductive—or rather that according to his own
definition he would have to call a relatively small part of
his “unproductive” labour <i>productive;</i> a
point therefore that does not tell against the
<i>distinction</i>, but against the <i>subsumption</i> of
certain activities under the distinction or <i>the way it is
applied</i>.  After making all these comments, the
learned Garnier finally comes to the point.</p>
<p class="quote">“The only general difference that
can, it seems, be observed between […] the two
classes assumed by Smith, is that in the class which he
calls <i>productive</i>, there is or <i>may always be some
intermediary person between the maker of the object and the
person who consumes it;</i> whereas in the <i>labour</i>
that he calls <i>non-productive, there cannot be any
intermediary</i>, and the relation <i>between the labourer
and the consumer is necessarily direct and
immediate</i>.  It is evident that there is
<i>necessarily</i> a direct and immediate relation between
the person who uses the experience of the physician, the
skill of the surgeon, the knowledge of the lawyer, the
talent of the musician or actor, or finally the services of
the domestic servant, and each of these different hired
workers at the moment of their labour; while in the
professions constituting the other class, <i>the thing to be
consumed being material and palpable, it can be the subject
of many intermediary exchanges</i> after leaving the person
who makes it before it reaches the one who consumes
it” (p. 174).</p>
<p>In these last words Garnier shows, in spite of himself,
the concealed association of ideas that exists between
Smith’s first distinction (labour which is exchanged against
capital, and labour which is exchanged against revenue) and
his second (labour which fixes itself in a material,
vendible commodity and labour which does not so fix
itself).  The latter by its nature <i>cannot</i> for
the most part be subordinated to the capitalist mode of
production; the former can.  To say nothing of the fact
<i>that on the basis of capitalist production</i>, where the
great majority of material commodities—material and
palpable things—is produced by wage-labourers under
the domination of capital, [unproductive] labours (or
services, whether those of a prostitute or of the Pope) can
only be paid for either out of the wages of the productive
labourers, or out of the profits of their employers (and the
partners in those profits), quite apart from the
circumstances that those productive labourers produce the
material basis of the subsistence, and consequently, the
existence, of the unproductive labourers.  It is
however characteristic of this shallow French cur that he,
who wants to be an expert in political economy and so an
explorer of capitalist production, considers
<i>inessential</i> the feature which makes this production
capitalist—the exchange of capital for wage-labour
instead of the direct exchange of revenue for wage-labour or
the revenue which the labourer directly pays to
himself.  By so doing Garnier makes capitalist
production itself an inessential form instead of a
necessary—though only historically, that is,
transiently necessary —form for the development of the
social productive powers of labour and the transformation of
labour into social labour.</p>
<p class="quote">“… it would also always be
necessary to deduct from his <i>productive</i> class all
labourers whose labour consists purely of cleaning,
conserving or repairing finished articles, and consequently
does not put any new product into circulation”
(p. 175).</p>
<p>(Smith nowhere says that the labour or its product must
enter into the circulating capital.  It can enter
directly into fixed capital, like the mechanic’s labour
repairing a machine in a factory.  But in this case its
<i>value</i> enters into the circulation of the product, the
commodity.  And the repairers, etc., who do this labour
as servants, do not exchange <span class="context">||350|</span> their labour against capital
but against revenue.)</p>
<p class="quote">“It is in consequence of this
difference that the <i>non-productive</i> class, as Smith
has observed, subsists only on revenues.  In fact,
since this class allows of no intermediary between itself
and the consumer of its products, that is to say, the person
who enjoys its labour, it is paid immediately by the
consumer; and <i>he pays only from revenues</i>.  As
against these, the labourers of the <i>productive</i> class,
being as a rule paid by an <i>intermediary who intends to
make a profit from their labour, are most often paid by
capital</i>.  But this capital is always in the end
replaced by the revenue of a consumer, otherwise it would
not circulate and therefore would not yield any profit to
its possessor.“</p>
<p>This last “but” is quite childish.  In
the first place, a part of the capital is replaced by
capital and not by revenue, whether this part of the capital
circulates or does not circulate (as in the case of
seed).</p>
<p><a id="s7b"> </a></p>
<h4>[(b) Replacement of the Constant Capital by Means of the
Exchange of capital against Capital]</h4>
<p>When a coal-mine supplies coal to an ironworks and gets
from the latter iron which enters into the operations of the
coal-mine as means of production, the coal is in this way
exchanged for capital to the amount of the value of this
iron, and reciprocally the iron, to the amount of its own
value, is exchanged as capital for coal.  Both
(considered as use-values) are products of new labour,
although this labour was produced with means of labour that
were already in existence.  But the value of the
product of the year s labour is not the product of the
labour [newly added] in the year.  It also replaces the
value of the past labour which was materialised in the means
of production.  Therefore the part of the total product
which is equal to this value is not a part of the product of
the year’s labour, but the reproduction of past labour.</p>
<p>Let us take for example the product of the daily labour
of a coal-mine, an ironworks, a timber producer and a
machine-building factory.  Let the constant capital in
all these industries be equal to one-third of all the
component parts of value in the product: that is, let the
proportion of pre-existing labour to living labour be 1 :
2.  Then all these industries produce each a daily
product of x, x', x'', x'''. 
These products are certain quantities of coal, iron, timber
and machinery.  As such products, they are products of
the day’s labour (but also of the daily consumed raw
materials, fuel, machinery, etc., which have all contributed
to the day’s production).  Let the values of these be
equal to z, z', z'',
z'''.  These values are not the product of
the day’s labour, since z/3, z'/3, z''/3, z'''/3 are only
equal to the value which the constant elements of z, z',
z'', z''' had before they entered into the day’s
labour.  Therefore also x/3, x'/3, x''/3, x'''/3, or a
third part of the use values produced, represent only the
value of the pre-existing labour and continually replace
it.  &lt;The exchange which here takes place between
pre-existing labour and the <i>product</i> of living labour
is of quite a different nature from the exchange between
labour-power and the conditions of labour existing as
capital.&gt;</p>
<p>x=z; yet z is the value of the total x, but one-third of
z is equal to the value of the raw material, etc., contained
in the total x, Thus is a part of the day’s product of the
labour &lt;but not at all the product of the day’s labour,
but on the contrary of the previous pre-existing labour
combined with it&gt; in which the preexisting labour
combined with the day’s labour reappears and is
replaced.  Now it is true that each aliquot part of x,
which is simply the quantity of actual products (iron, coal,
etc.), represents in its value one-third pre-existing labour
and two-thirds labour performed or added the same day. 
Pre-existing labour and the day’s labour enter into the
total product in the same proportion as they enter into each
separate product of which the total product is made
up.  But if I divide the total product into two parts,
putting one-third on one side and two-thirds on the other,
it is the same as if the one-third represents only
pre-existing labour and the other two-thirds only the labour
of the day.  In fact the first one-third represents all
past labour which entered into the total product, the full
value of the means of production consumed.  After
deducting this one-third, therefore, the other two-thirds
can represent only the product of the day’s labour. 
The two-thirds in fact represent the total amount of the
day’s labour that was added to the means of production.</p>
<p>The last two-thirds are therefore equal to the producer’s
revenue (profit and wages).  He can consume them, that
is, spend them on articles which enter into his individual
consumption.  Suppose that these two-thirds of the coal
produced daily were bought by the consumers or purchasers
not with money, but with the commodities which they have
previously transformed into money in order to buy coal with
it.  A part of these two-thirds of the coal will enter
into the individual consumption of the coal producers
themselves, for heating, etc.  This part therefore does
not enter into circulation, or if it does first enter into
circulation it will be withdrawn again from it <span class="context">||351|</span> by its own producers. 
Minus this part of the two-thirds which the producers of
coal themselves consume, they must exchange all the rest of
it (if they want to consume it) for articles which enter
into individual consumption.</p>
<p>In this exchange it is a matter of complete indifference
to them whether the sellers of the consumable articles
exchange capital or revenue for the coal; that is to say,
whether for example the cloth manufacturer exchanges his
cloth for coal in order to heat his private dwelling (in
this case the coal itself in turn is an article of
consumption for him, and he pays for it with revenue, with a
quantity of cloth that represents profit); or whether James,
the cloth manufacturer’s footman, exchanges the cloth he has
received as wages for the coal (in this case the latter is
once more an article of consumption and exchanged for the
revenue of the cloth manufacturer, who in turn however has
exchanged his revenue for the unproductive labour of the
footman); or whether the cloth manufacturer exchanges cloth
for coal in order to replace the coal required in his
factory that has been used up.  (In the latter case the
cloth that the cloth manufacturer exchanges represents for
him constant capital, the value of one of his means of
production; and the coal represents for him not only the
value but his means of production in kind, But for the coal
producer the cloth is an article of consumption, and both
cloth and coal represent for him revenue; the coal, revenue
in its non-realised form; the cloth, revenue in its realised
form.)</p>
<p>But as for the last one-third of the coal, the coal
producer cannot spend it on articles which enter into his
individual consumption; he cannot spend it as revenue. 
It belongs to the process of production (or reproduction)
and must be transformed into iron, timber,
machinery—into articles which form the component parts
of his constant capital and without which the production of
coal cannot be renewed or continued.  He could, it is
true, exchange also this one-third for articles of
consumption (or, what is the same thing, for the money of
the producers of these articles), but in fact only on the
condition that he exchanges these consumption articles in
turn for iron, timber, machinery—that they enter
neither into his own consumption nor into the outlay of his
revenue, but into the consumption and revenue outlays of the
producers of timber, iron and machinery; all of whom,
however, in turn find themselves in the position of not
being able to expend one-third of their product on articles
for individual consumption.</p>
<p>Now let us assume that coal enters into the constant
capital of the producers of iron and timber, and of the
machine builder.  On the other hand iron, timber, and
machinery enter into the constant capital of the producer of
coal.  In so far as these products of theirs enter
[into their] mutual [constant capital] to the same amount of
value, they replace themselves in kind, and one has to pay
the other only the balance for the surplus that he has
bought from him in excess of what he has sold to him. 
In fact, in such a transaction money appears in practice
(through the medium of bills of exchange, etc.) only as
<i>means of payment</i>, not as coin, means of circulation;
and only the balance is paid in money.  The producer of
coal will need a part of this one-third of his coal for his
own reproduction, just as he deducted from the product a
part of the two-thirds for his own consumption.</p>
<p>The whole quantity of coal, iron, timber and machinery
which are reciprocally replaced in this way by the exchange
of constant capital for constant capital, of constant
capital in one natural form for constant capital in another
natural form, has absolutely nothing to do either with the
exchange of revenue for constant capital or with the
exchange of revenue for revenue.  It plays exactly the
same role as seed in agriculture or the capital stock of
cattle in cattle-rearing.  It is a part of the
<i>yearly product of labour</i>, but it is not a part <i>of
the product of the year’s [newly- added] labour</i> (on the
contrary it is a part of the product of the year’s labour
plus the pre-existing labour), which (conditions of
production remaining the same) replaces itself annually as
means of production, as constant capital, without entering
into any circulation other than that between dealers and
dealers and without affecting the <i>value of</i> the part
of the product which enters into the circulation between
dealers and consumers.</p>
<p>Let us assume that the whole one-third of the coal is
thus exchanged in kind for its own elements of production,
iron, timber, machinery.  &lt;It might be possible for
example to exchange the entire amount direct for machinery;
but the machine builder in turn would exchange it as
constant capital, not only for his own but for that of the
producers of iron and timber.&gt; In fact, each
hundredweight of the two-thirds of his product in coal <span class="context">||352|</span> which he exchanged for
articles of consumption, exchanged as revenue, would, from
the standpoint of value, consist of two parts, as the total
product does.  One-third of a hundredweight would be
equal to the value of the means of production used up in the
hundredweight, and two-thirds of the hundredweight would be
equal to the labour newly added to this third by the
producers of the coal.  But if the total product is for
example equal to 30,000 hundredweight he exchanges only
20,000 hundredweight as revenue.  On the assumption
made, the other 10,000 hundredweight would be replaced by
iron, timber, machinery, etc., etc.; in a word, the whole
value of the means of production used up in the 30,000
hundredweight would be replaced in kind by means of
production of the same sort and of equal value.</p>
<p>The buyers of the 20,000 hundredweight thus do not pay a
single farthing for the value of the pre-existing labour
contained in the 20,000 hundredweight; for the 20,000
represent only two-thirds of the value of the total product
in which the newly-added labour is realised.  It comes
to the same thing, therefore, as if the 20,000 hundredweight
represented only labour newly added (during the year, for
example) and no pre-existing labour.  The buyer
therefore pays the whole value of each hundredweight,
pre-existing labour plus newly-added labour, and yet he pays
only for the newly-added labour; and that is because the
quantity he buys is only 20,000 hundredweight, only that
quantity of the total product which is equal to the value of
all the newly-added labour.  Just as little does he pay
for the farmer’s seed in paying for the wheat which he
eats.  The producers have mutually replaced this part
for each other; therefore they do not need to have it
replaced a second time.  They have replaced it with the
part of their own product which it is true is the year’s
product of their labour, but is not at all the product of
their year’s labour, but on the contrary is the part of
their annual product that represents the pre-existing
labour.  Without the new labour the product would not
be there; but in the same way it would not be there without
the labour materialised in the means of production.  If
it were merely the product of the new labour, then its value
would be less than it now is, and there would be no part of
the product to be returned to production.  But if the
other method of labour [using means of production] were not
more productive and did not yield more product in spite of a
part of the product having to be returned to production, it
would not be used.</p>
<p>Although no part of the value of the one-third of the
coal enters into the 20,000 hundredweight of coal sold as
revenue, any change in the value of the constant capital
which the one-third or 10,000 hundredweight represented
would nevertheless bring about a change of value in the
other two-thirds which are sold as revenue.  Let
production in iron, timber, machinery and so on, in a word,
in the elements of production of which the one-third of the
product is composed, become more costly.  Let the
productivity of mining labour remain the same.  The
30,000 hundredweight are produced with the same quantity of
iron, timber, coal, machinery and labour as before. 
But since iron, timber and machinery have got dearer, cost
more labour-time than before, more coal than before must be
given for them.</p>
<p><span class="context">||353|</span> As previously, the
product would be equal to 30,000 hundredweight.  The
coal-mining labour has remained as productive as it was
before.  With the same quantity of living labour and
the same amount of timber, iron, machinery, etc., it
produces 30,000 hundredweight as before.  The living
labour, as before, is represented by the same value, say
£20,000 (reckoned in money).  On the other hand
timber, iron, etc., in a word, the constant capital, now
cost £16,000 instead of £10,000; that is to say,
the labour-time contained in them has increased by
six-tenths, or 60 per cent.</p>
<p>The value of the total product is now equal to
£36,000; it was £30,000 before; it has therefore
risen by one-fifth, or 20 per cent.  So also every
aliquot part of the product costs one-fifth, or 20 per cent,
more than before.  If a hundredweight cost £1
previously, then now it costs £1 plus one-fifth of
£1=£1. 4s. Previously,
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> or <sup class="ratio">3</sup>/<sub class="ratio">9</sub> of
the total product was equal to constant capital,
<sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> equal to labour added.  Now
the proportion of the constant capital to the value of the
total product is as 16,000 : 36,000 =
<sup class="ratio">16</sup>/<sub class="ratio">36</sub> =
<sup class="ratio">4</sup>/<sub class="ratio">9</sub>.  It amounts therefore to
one-ninth [of the value of the total product] more than
before.  The part of the product which is equal to the
value of the labour added was formerly
<sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> or <sup class="ratio">6</sup>/<sub class="ratio">9</sub> of
the product, now it is <sup class="ratio">5</sup>/<sub class="ratio">9</sub>.</p>
<p><i>So we get:</i></p>
<table class="text" width="86%">
<tr><td></td><td>Constant capital</td><td>Labour added</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Value</b> = £36,000</td>
<td>£16,000 (<sup class="ratio">4</sup>/<sub class="ratio">9</sub> of the product)</td>
<td>£20,000(the
same value as before = <sup class="ratio">5</sup>/<sub class="ratio">9</sub> of the
product</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Product</b> = 30,000 cwt.</td>
<td>13,333 <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> cwt.</td>
<td>16,666 <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> cwt.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The coal miners’ labour would not have become less
productive; but the product of their labour plus the
pre-existing labour would have become less productive; that
is, <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">9</sub> more of the total product
would be required to replace the component part of the value
<span class="context">||354 |</span> formed by the constant
capital.  <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">9</sub> less of the product
would be equal to the value of the labour added.  Now
as before the producers of iron, timber, etc., would only
pay for 10,000 cwt. of coal.  Previously these cost
them £10,000.  They will now cost them
£12,000.  A part of the costs of the constant
capital would therefore be made good, since they would have
to pay the increased price for the part of the coal which
they get in replacement of iron, etc.  But the producer
of coal has to buy raw material, etc., from them to the
amount of £16,000.  There remains therefore a
debit balance of £4,000, that is, 3,333
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> cwt. of coal.  He must
therefore, as before, supply 16,666
<sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> + 3,333 <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>
cwt. = 20,000 cwt. of coal = two-thirds of the product to
the consumers, who would now have to pay £24,000 for
it instead of £20,000.  In so doing they would
have to replace for him not only labour, but also a part of
the constant capital.</p>
<p>As regards the consumers, the matter would be very
simple.  If they wished to consume the same quantity of
coal as before, they must pay one-fifth more for it and so
must spend one-fifth of their revenue less on other
products, if the production costs have remained the same in
every branch of production.  The difficulty lies only
in this: how does the producer of coal pay for the
£4,000 of iron, timber, etc., for which their
producers do not want coal in exchange?  He has sold
the 3,333 <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> cwt., equal to this
£4,000, to the consumers of coal, and has received in
exchange commodities of all kinds.  But these cannot
enter into his consumption or that of his labourers, but
must pass into the consumption of the producers of iron,
timber, etc., for he must replace in these articles the
value of his 3,333 <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> cwt.  It
will be said: it’s quite a simple matter.  All
consumers of coal have to consume <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">5</sub>
less of all other commodities, or each of them has to give
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">5</sub> more of his commodities for
coal.  The producers of timber, iron, etc., consume
exactly this <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">5</sub> more.  However,
it is not <i>prima facie</i> evident how the lowered
productivity in the ironworks, machine building,
timber-felling, etc., is to enable their producers to
consume a larger revenue than before, since the price of
their articles is supposed to be equal to their values, and,
consequently, to have risen only in proportion to the
diminished productivity of their labour.</p>
<p>Now it is assumed that iron, timber, machinery have risen
in value by three-fifths, by 60 per cent.  There are
only two causes which can give rise to this.  Either
the iron, timber, etc., production has become less
productive, because the living labour used in it has become
less productive, that is, a greater quantity of labour must
be used to produce the same product.  In this case the
producers must use three-fifths more labour than
before.  The rate of wages has remained the same,
because the lowered productivity of labour has only a
passing effect on individual products.  Therefore the
rate of surplus-value also has remained the same.  The
producer needs 24 days’ labour where he needed 15 before;
but he pays the labourers, as before, only 10 hours’ labour
on each of the 24 [working-days], and makes them work 2
[hours] for nothing on each of these days, as
previously.  If the 15 [labourers] have therefore done
150 hours’ labour for themselves and 30 for him; so the 24
work 240 hours for themselves and 48 for him.  (Here we
don’t worry about the rate of profit.) Wages have only
fallen in so far as they are spent in iron, timber and
machinery, etc., which is not the case.  The 24
labourers now consume <sup class="ratio">3</sup>/<sub class="ratio">5</sub> more than
the 15 did before.  So the coal producers can set aside
correspondingly more for them from the value of the 3,333
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> cwt, (i.e., for their master, who
pays out the wages).</p>
<p>Or the reduced productivity in the production of iron,
timber, etc., arises from the fact that parts of their
constant capital, of their means of production, have become
dearer.  Then the same alternative applies, and finally
the reduced productivity must result in the use of a greater
quantity of living labour; therefore also in increased
wages, which the coal producer has partly received from the
consumers in the £4,000.</p>
<p>In the branches of production where more labour is
employed, the amount of the surplus-value will have risen
because the number of workers employed is greater.  On
the other hand, the rate of profit will have fallen in so
far as all component parts of their constant capital into
which their own product enters [have risen]; whether they
themselves use a part of their own product as means of
production, or, as in the case of coal, their product enters
as a means of production into their own means of
production.  However, if their circulating capital laid
out in wages has increased more than the part of the
constant capital that they have to replace, their rate of
profit will also have risen, and they <span class="context">||355|</span> will participate in the
consumption of a part of the £4,000.</p>
<p>An increase in the value of the constant capital (arising
from lowered productivity in the branches of labour which
supply it) raises the value of the product into which it
enters as constant capital, and reduces the part of the
product (in kind) which replaces the newly-added labour,
thus making it less productive in so far as this is reckoned
in its own product.  For the part of the constant
capital which is exchanged in kind, the position is the same
as it was.  The same quantity of iron, timber and coal
as before will be exchanged in kind in order to replace the
iron, timber and coal that has been used up, and in this
transaction the higher prices will balance each other. 
But the surplus of coal which now forms a part of the
constant capital of the coal producer and does not enter
into this exchange in kind is, as before, exchanged for
revenue (in the case given above, in part not only for wages
but also for profit); this revenue, however, instead of
going to the former consumers, accrues to the producers in
whose spheres of production a greater quantity of labour is
used, that is, the number of labourers has increased.</p>
<p>If a branch of industry produces products which enter
only into individual consumption, and neither into other
industries as means of production (by means of production
constant capital is always meant here) nor into their own
reproduction (as for example in agriculture, cattle-raising,
or the coal industry, into which coal itself enters as
auxiliary material), then the annual product of this
branch&lt;any possible surplus over the annual product
making no difference in this connection&gt; must always be
paid for out of revenue, wages or profit.</p>
<p>Let us take the case of the linen given earlier. 
Three yards of linen consist of: two-thirds constant capital
and one-third labour added.  One yard of linen
therefore represents labour added.  If the
surplus-value is 25 per cent, then one-fifth of the 1 yard
represents the profit, the other four-fifths represent the
reproduction of the wages.  The manufacturer himself
consumes the one-fifth, or what is the same thing, others
consume it and pay him the value, which he consumes in their
own or in other commodities.  &lt;To simplify matters,
here the whole profit is—wrongly—considered as
revenue.&gt; But he expends the four-fifths of a yard again
in wages; his labourers consume them as their revenue either
directly or in exchange for other consumable products, whose
owners consume the linen.</p>
<p>This is the total part of the 3 yards of linen—the
1 yard—which the linen producers can themselves
consume as revenue.  The other 2 yards represent the
manufacturer’s constant capital; they must be reconverted
into the conditions of production for linen—yarn,
machinery, etc.  From the standpoint of the
manufacturer, the exchange ‘of the 2 yards of linen is
an exchange of constant capital; but he can only exchange it
against the revenue of other people.  So he pays for
the yarn, say, with <sup class="ratio">4</sup>/<sub class="ratio">5</sub> of the 2 yards
or <sup class="ratio">8</sup>/<sub class="ratio">5</sub> yards, and for the machinery
with <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">5</sub> of a yard.  The spinner
and machine builder in turn can each consume
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> of what they get, that is, the
former, out of <sup class="ratio">8</sup>/<sub class="ratio">5</sub> yards,
<sup class="ratio">8</sup>/<sub class="ratio">15</sub> of a yard; the latter
<sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">15</sub> out of the
<sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">5</sub> of a [yard].  Added together,
<sup class="ratio">10</sup>/<sub class="ratio">15</sub> or <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> of
a yard.  But <sup class="ratio">20</sup>/<sub class="ratio">15</sub> or
<sup class="ratio">4</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> yards must replace for them the
raw material, flax, iron, coal, etc., and each of these
articles in turn consists of one part which represents
revenue (labour newly added), and another part which
represents constant capital (raw materials and fixed
capital, etc.).</p>
<p>The last <sup class="ratio">4</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> yards, however, can
only be consumed as revenue.  What therefore ultimately
appears as constant capital in yarn and machinery and is
used by the spinner and machine builder to replace the flax,
iron and coal (except for the part of the iron, coal, etc.,
which the machine builder replaces with machines) can only
represent the part of the flax, iron and coal which forms
the revenue of the flax, iron and coal producers, so that
there is no constant capital to be replaced in this; that is
to say, it must belong to the part of the product into
which, as shown above, no part of the constant capital
enters.  But these producers consume what is their
revenue in iron, coal, flax, etc., in linen or in other
consumable products, because their own products do not enter
in that form, or only to a small extent, into their
individual consumption.  Thus a part of the iron, flax,
etc., can be exchanged for a product which only enters into
individual consumption, that is linen, and in exchange for
it replace for the spinner all, and for the machine builder
part, of his constant capital; while in turn the spinner and
machine builder, with the part of their yarn and machinery
that represents revenue, consume linen and thereby replace
the weaver’s constant capital.</p>
<p>Thus in fact the whole of the linen is resolved into the
profits and wages of the weaver, spinner, machine builder,
flax-grower and producers of coal and of iron, while at the
same time they replace the whole of the constant capital for
the linen manufacturer and the spinner.  The account
would not balance if the final producers of raw materials
had to replace their own constant capital by exchange with
the linen, since this is an article for individual
consumption, which does not enter into any sphere of
production as means of production, <span class="context">||356|</span> as part of the constant
capital.  The account balances, because the linen
bought by the flax-grower, producers of coal and of iron,
machine builder, etc., with their own product, replaces for
them only the part of their product which consists in
revenue for <i>them</i>, but in constant capital for those
who buy their products.  That is only possible because
they replace the part of their product which does not
consist of revenue and which therefore cannot be exchanged
for consumable products, in kind or by the exchange of
constant capital for constant capital.</p>
<p>In the example given above it may seem strange that it is
assumed that the productivity of labour in a given branch of
industry has remained the same, and yet that it has fallen,
if the productivity of the living labour employed in this
branch of industry is reckoned in its own product.  But
this is very simply explained.</p>
<p>Suppose the product of a spinner’s labour is equal to 5
lbs. of yarn.  Assume that he needs for this only 5
lbs. of cotton (that is, there is no waste); and that an
lb. of yarn costs 1 shilling (we leave the machinery out of
account; that is, we suppose that its value has neither
fallen nor risen; for the case we are considering,
therefore, its value is equal to nil).  [Let] cotton
[cost] 8d. an lb.  Of the 5s, which the 5 lbs. of yarn
costs, 40d.  (5x8d.)=3s. 4d. is for the cotton, and
5x4d.=20d.=1s. 8d, is the newly-added labour.  Of the
total product, therefore, constant capital amounts to
3s. 4d., [that is,] 3 <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> lbs, of
yarn, and labour to 1 <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> lbs. of
yarn, Hence two-thirds of the 5 lbs. of yarn replace
constant capital and one-third of the 5 lbs, of yarn, or 1
<sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> lbs., is the part of the product
which pays for the labour.  Assume that the price of an
lb. of cotton now rises by 50 per cent, from 8d. to 12d., or
1s.  Then we have for 5 lbs, of yarn, first, 5s. for 5
lbs. of cotton, and 1s. 8d. for labour added, whose
quantity, and therefore whose value expressed in money,
remains the same.  Thus the 5 lbs.  of yarn now costs
5s, plus 1s. 8d.=6s, 8d.  Of this 6s. 8d., however, raw
material is now 5s, and labour 1s. 8d.</p>
<p>6s. 8d.=80 d., of which 60d, is for raw material and
20d. for labour.  Labour now only forms 20d, of the
value of the 5 lbs., 80d., or <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">4</sub>=25
per cent; previously, 33 <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> per
cent.  On the other hand the raw material is 60d =
<sup class="ratio">3</sup>/<sub class="ratio">4</sub> = 75 per cent; previously it was
only 66 <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> per cent.  As the 5
lbs.  of yarn now costs 80d., 1 lb. costs
<sup class="ratio">80</sup>/<sub class="ratio">5</sub>d.=16d.  For his
20d.—the value of the [newly-added] labour—[the
spinner] will therefore get 1 <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">4</sub> lbs,
of the 5 lbs, of yarn, and [the other] 3
<sup class="ratio">3</sup>/<sub class="ratio">4</sub> lbs. [go for] raw material. 
Previously, 1 <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> lbs. were for labour
(profit and wages) and 3 <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> lbs, for
constant capital.  Reckoned in its own product,
therefore, the labour has become less productive, although
its productivity has remained the same and only the raw
material has got dearer.  But it has remained equally
productive, because the same labour has transformed 5
lbs. of cotton into 5 lbs. of yarn in the same time, and the
actual product of this labour (considered as use-value) is
only the <i>form of yarn</i> which has been given to the
cotton.  The 5 lbs. of cotton have been given the form
of yarn as before, with the same labour.  The actual
product, however, consists not only of this form of yarn but
also of the raw cotton, the material which has been put into
this form, and the value of this material now forms a
greater part of the total product than it did before, in
proportion to the labour which gives it the form. 
Consequently the same quantity of spinning labour is paid
for in less yarn, or the part of the product which replaces
it has become smaller.</p>
<p>So much for that.</p>

<h4>[(c) Vulgar Assumptions of Garnier’s Polemics against
smith, Garnier’s Relapse into Physiocratic Ideas.  The
View of the Unproductive Labourers’ Consumption as the
source of Production—a step Backwards as Compared with
the Physiocrats]</h4>
<p>So in the first place Garnier is wrong when he says that
the whole capital is in the end always replaced by
consumer’s revenue, since a part of the capital can be
replaced by capital and not by revenue.  Secondly, it
is in itself a silly statement, since revenue itself, in so
far as it is not wages (or wages paid by wages, revenue
derived from wages), is profit on capital (or revenue
derived from profit on capital).  Finally, it is silly
to say that the part of capital which does not circulate (in
the sense that it is not replaced by consumer’s revenue)
“yields no profit to its possessor”.  In
fact— conditions of production remaining the
same—this part yields no profit (or rather, no
surplus-value).  But without it capital could in no
case produce its profit.</p>
<p><span class="context">||357|</span> “All that can
be deduced from this difference is that, in order to employ
<i>productive</i> people, what is required is not only the
<i>revenue of the person who enjoys their labour</i>, but
<i>also a capitol which yields profit to intermediaries</i>,
while <i>to employ non-productive people</i> the revenue
which pays them is most often sufficient” (l.c.,
p. 175).</p>
<p>This one sentence is such a bundle of nonsense that it
makes it clear that Garnier, the translator of Adam Smith,
in fact understood nothing of what Adam Smith wrote, and in
particular had no conception whatever of the essence of the
<i>Wealth of Nations</i>—namely, the view that the
capitalist mode of production is the most productive mode
(which it absolutely is, in comparison with previous
forms).</p>
<p>First, it is an extremely silly objection to raise
against Smith, who declared that unproductive labour was
labour paid directly from revenue, that “to employ
<i>non-productive</i> people the revenue which pays them is
most often sufficient”.  Now however the
antithesis:</p>
<p class="quote">“in order to employ productive
people, what is required is not only the revenue of the
person who enjoys their labour, but also a capital which
yields profit to intermediaries.  “</p>
<p>(How productive then must agricultural labour be for
Monsieur Garnier, which in addition to the revenue which
enjoys the product of the land, requires a capital which not
only yields profit to intermediaries, but in addition a rent
to the landowner!)</p>
<p>In order “to employ these productive people”,
what is necessary is not first capital that employs them,
and secondly revenue that enjoys their labour, but nothing
other than capital, which produces the revenue, which enjoys
the fruit of their labour.  If as a capitalist tailor I
lay out £100 in wages, this £100 produces for me
say £120.  It produces for me a revenue of
£20, with which I can then, if I want to, also enjoy
tailoring labour in the form of a
“frockcoat”.  If on the other hand I buy
clothes for £20 in order to wear them, it is obvious
that these clothes have not created the £20 with which
I buy them.  And the case would be the same if I got a
jobbing tailor to come to my house and made him sew coats
for me for £20.  In the first case I received
£20 more than I had before, and in the second case,
after the transaction, I have £20 less than I had
before.  Moreover, I would soon realise that the tailor
whom I pay directly from revenue does not make the coat as
cheaply as if I bought it from the intermediary.</p>
<p>Garnier imagines that the profit is paid by the
consumer.  The consumer pays the “value” of
the commodity; and although it contains a profit for the
capitalist, the commodity is cheaper for him, the consumer,
than if he had spent his revenue directly on labour causing
it to produce on a small scale for his personal
requirements.  It is obvious here that Garnier has not
the slightest idea of what capital is.</p>
<p>He continues:</p>
<p class="quote">“Do not many unproductive workers,
such as actors, musicians, etc., as a rule only receive
their wages through the channel of a manager w ho draws
profits from the capital placed in this kind of
enterprise?” (l.c., pp.175-76).</p>
<p>This observation is correct, but it only shows that a
part of the labourers whom Adam Smith in his second
definition calls unproductive are productive according to
his first definition.</p>
<p class="quote">“It follows therefore that in a
society in which the <i>productive</i> class is very
numerous, it must be supposed that a large accumulation of
capitals exists in the hands of the intermediaries or
entrepreneurs of labour” (l.c., p. 176).</p>
<p>In fact, wage-labour on a mass scale is only another
expression for capital on a mass scale.</p>
<p class="quote">“It is therefore not, as Smith
maintains, the proportion existing between the mass of
capitals and that of revenues which will determine the
proportion between the <i>productive</i> class and the
<i>non-productive</i> class.  This latter proportion
seems to depend much more on the customs and habits of the
people; on the more or less advanced degree of its
industry” (l.c., p.  177).</p>
<p>If productive labourers are such as are paid from
capital, and unproductive such as are paid from revenue, the
proportion of the productive class to the unproductive is
obviously that of capital to revenue.  The proportional
growth of the two classes, however, will not depend only on
the existing proportion of the mass of capitals to the mass
of revenues.  It will depend on the proportion in which
the increasing revenue (profit) is transformed into capital
or expended as revenue.  Although the bourgeoisie was
originally very thrifty, with the growing productivity of
capital, i.e., of the labourers, <span class="context">||358|</span> it imitates the retainer
system of the feudal lords.  According to the latest
report (1861 or 1862)<a href="#_ftn15" id="_ftnref15">*</a> on the factories, the total number of
persons (managers included) employed in the factories
properly so called of the United Kingdom was only 775,534,<a href="#_ftn16" id="_ftnref16">*</a> while the number of
female servants in England alone amounted to 1
million.  What a convenient arrangement it is that
makes a factory girl to sweat twelve hours in a factory, so
that the factory proprietor, with a part of her unpaid
labour, can take into his personal service her sister as
maid, her brother as groom and her cousin as soldier or
policeman!</p>
<p>Garnier’s last sentence is trite tautology.  He
makes the proportion between the productive and the
unproductive classes depend, not on the proportion of
capital and revenue—or rather on the mass of existing
commodities which are expended in the form of capital or of
revenue—but (?) on the customs and habits of the
people, on the degree of development of its industry. 
In fact, capitalist production first appears at a certain
stage of development of industry.</p>
<p>As a Bonapartist senator, Garnier naturally waxes
enthusiastic over lackeys and servitors in general:
“No class with an equal number of individuals
contributes more than domestic servants to the conversion
into <i>capital</i> of sums originating from <i>revenue</i>
“(p. 181).</p>
<p>In fact, no class provides a more worthless section of
recruits for the petty bourgeoisie.  Garnier does not
understand how Smith, “a man who has observed things
with such sagacity”, does not value more highly
“this intermediary, placed close to the rich, in order
<i>to gather up</i> the scraps of revenue which the latter
so thoughtlessly dissipates” (l.c., pp. 82,
183).  He himself says in this sentence that he merely
“gathers up” the scraps of
“revenue”.  But of what does this revenue
consist?  Of the unpaid labour of the productive
labourer.</p>
<p>After all these extremely worthless polemics against
Smith, Garnier, relapsing into Physiocracy, declares
agricultural labour the only productive labour!  And
why?  Because it “creates another new value, a
value which <i>did not exist</i> in society, even as an
equivalent, at the moment when this labour began to be
performed; and it is this value which provides a rent to the
owner of the land” (l.c., p. 184).</p>
<p>So what is productive labour?  Labour which produces
a surplus-value, a new value over and above the equivalent
which it receives as wages.  Smith is not to blame for
Garnier’s failing to understand that the exchange <i>of
capital for labour</i> means <i>nothing but</i> the exchange
of a commodity of a given value—equal to a given
quantity of labour—for a greater quantity of labour
than it itself contains, and thus creates “a new
value, a value which did not exist in society, even as an
equivalent, at the moment when this labour began to be
performed”.  <span class="context">|VIII-358||</span></p>

Abrégé élémmentaire des

with the Physiocratic view that agriculture alone is
productive another is to be found (which to a great extent
explains his polemic against Adam Smith), namely, that
consumption (strongly represented by the “unproductive
labourers”) is the source of production, and that the
volume of the latter is to be measured by the volume of the
former.  The unproductive labourers satisfy artificial
needs and consume material products, and are thus in every
way useful, He also polemises, therefore, against economy

<p>&lt;There is a confusion here: the value and the price of
a thing is not determined by the economy of time effected
through the division of labour; but I get more use-value for
the same value, labour is more productive, because a greater
quantity of products is produced in the same time; however

<h3>[8.]  Charles Ganilh [Mercantilist Conception of Exchange
and Exchange-Value.  Inclusion of All Paid Labour in
the Concept of Productive Labour]</h3>
<p><span class="context">||VIII-358|</span> A very inferior and superficial
compilation is Charles Ganilh’s <i>Des systémes
d’économie politique</i>, First edition Paris
<i>1809</i>, second <i>1821</i>.  (Quotations from the
latter.) His twaddle is directly linked with Garnier,
against whom he polemises.</p>
<p>&lt;<i>Canard</i> in <i>Principes</i><i>
d’économie politique</i> defines
“<i>wealth</i>” [as] “<i>an accumulation
of supeflruous labour”.  <sup class="ratio"> </sup></i>Had
he said that it is the labour which is superfluous for
keeping the labourer alive as a labourer, the definition
would be correct.&gt;</p>
<p>Monsieur Ganilh’s starting-point is the elementary fact
that the commodity is the element of bourgeois wealth, and
therefore labour, in order to produce wealth, must produce
commodities, must <i>sell</i> itself or its product.</p>
<p class="quote">“In the present state of
civilisation, labour is only known to us through
exchange” (l.c., t. I, p. 79).  “Labour
without exchange can produce no wealth” (l.c.,
p. 81).</p>
<p>From this Ganilh jumps straight into the Mercantile
system.</p>
<p class="quote">Because labour without exchange creates no bourgeois
wealth.  “wealth comes exclusively from
trade” (l.c., p. 84).  Or, as he says later:
“Exchange or trade alone gives value to things”
(l.c., p. 98).  On this “principle of the
identity of values and wealth … rests the doctrine of
the fruitfulness of general labour” (l.c., p. 93).</p>
<p>Ganilh himself declares <span class="context">||359|</span> that the “commercial
system” which he calls a mere
“modification” of the monetary system</p>
<p class="quote">“derives private and public wealth
from the exchangeable values of labour, whether these values
are or are not fixed in material, durable, and permanent
objects” (l.c., p. 95).</p>
<p>He thus falls into the Mercantile system, as Garnier fell
into the Physiocratic.  His trash, if good for nothing
else, is consequently not had as a characterisation of this
system and of its views on “surplus-value”,
especially as he puts forward these views in opposition to
Smith, Ricardo, etc.</p>
<p>Wealth is exchangeable value; all labour which produces
an exchangeable value or itself has an exchangeable value
consequently produces wealth.  The only word in which
Ganilh shows himself a more profound Mercantilist, is the
word <i>general</i> labour.  The labour of individuals,
or rather its product, must take the form of general
labour.  Only so is it exchange-value,
<i>money</i>.  In fact, Ganilh comes back to the view
that wealth is equivalent to money; though no longer only
gold and silver, but the commodity itself, in so far as it
is <i>money</i>.  He says: “<i>Commercial
system</i>, or the exchange of values of <i>general
labour</i>” (l.c., p. 98).  This is
nonsense.  The product is value as the form of
existence, as the incarnation of general labour, but not as
“the <i>value</i> of general labour”, which
would be equivalent to the value of value.  But let us
assume that the commodity is constituted as value, and has
even taken on the form of money, is metamorphosed.  It
is now exchangeable value.  But how great is its
value?  All commodities are exchangeable value. 
They are not different from each other in this.  But
what makes the exchangeable value of a definite
commodity?  Here Ganilh does not get beyond the crudest
superficiality.  A is of greater exchange-value when it
exchanges for more B, C, D, etc.</p>
<p>Ganilh is quite right when he says of Ricardo and most
economists that they consider labour without exchange,
although their system, like the whole bourgeois system,
rests on exchange-value.  This however is only due to
the fact that to them the <i>form</i> of product as
commodity seems self-evident, and consequently they examine
only the <i>magnitude of value</i>.  In exchange the
products of individuals only manifest themselves as products
of general labour by taking the form of <i>money</i>. 
This relativity, however, originates from the fact that they
must present themselves as the form of existence of general
labour, and can be reduced to it only as relative, merely
quantitatively different expressions of social labour. 
But the exchange itself does not give them their
<i>magnitude of value</i>.  In exchange they appear as
general social labour; and the extent to which they can
appear as general social labour depends on the extent to
which they can present themselves as social labour, that is,
on the extent of the commodities for which they can be
exchanged, and therefore on the expansion of the market, of
trade; on the range of commodities in which they can be
expressed as exchange-value.  For example, were there
only four different branches of production in existence,
each of the four producers would produce a great part of his
product for himself.  If there are thousands, then he
can produce his total product as commodities.  It can
enter entirely into exchange.  But Ganilh imagines,
with the Mercantilists, that <i>the magnitude of value is
itself the product of exchange</i>, whereas in fact it is
only the form of value or the form of <i>commodity</i> which
the product receives through exchange.</p>
<p class="quote">“Exchange gives <i>things</i> a value
which they would not have had without it”
(p. 102).</p>
<p>If this means that <i>things</i>, use-values, only become
value, receive this form as relative expressions of social
labour, it is a tautology.  But if it is intended to
mean that through exchange they get a greater value than
they would have had without it, it is clearly nonsense, for
exchange can only increase A’s magnitude of value by
reducing that of B.  So far as it gives A a greater
value than it has before the exchange, it gives B a smaller
value.  A+B, <i>therefore, has the same value after the
exchange as it had before it</i>.</p>
<p class="quote">“The most useful products may have no
value if exchange does not give any to them”
(p. 104).</p>
<p>(First, if these things are “products”, they
are from the start products of labour, not general elemental
things provided by nature like air, etc.; if they are
“the most useful”, they are use-values in the
highest sense, use-values that everyone needs; if exchange
gives them <i>no</i> value, this is only possible if
everyone produces them for himself; this however contradicts
<span class="context">||360|</span> the assumption that they
are produced for exchange; therefore the whole proposition
is nonsense.)</p>
<p class="quote">“And the most useless products may
have very great value, if exchange is favourable for
them” (p. 104).</p>
<p>For Monsieur Ganilh, “exchange” is a mystical
being.  If the “most useless” products are
no use for anything, have no use-value, who will buy
them?  They must therefore have at least an imaginary
“utility” for the buyer.  And if he is not
a fool, why should he pay more for them?  Their
dearness must therefore originate in some circumstance which
in any case does not arise from their
“uselessness”.  Their
“scarcity”, rarity?  But Ganilh calls them
“the most useless <i>products</i>”.  As
therefore they are products, why are they not produced in
greater quantities, in spite of their great
“exchange-value”?  If before it was the
buyer who was a fool, giving a lot of money for something
that had neither a real nor an imaginary use-value for him,
now it is the seller, who does not produce these trifles of
great exchange-value instead of utilities of small
value.  That their exchange-value is great in spite of
their small use-value (use-value determined by the natural
needs of man), must therefore be due to some circumstance
that originates not from Lord Exchange, but from the product
itself.  <i>Its high exchange-value is therefore not
the product of exchange, but only appears in
exchange</i>.</p>
<p class="quote">“The exchanged value of things and
not their exchangeable value establishes <i>the real
value</i>, the value which is identical with wealth”
(l.c., p. 104).</p>
<p>But exchangeable value is a relation of the thing to
other things with which it can be exchanged.  &lt;The
correct point underlying this statement is: what compels the
transformation of the commodity into money is that it has to
enter into exchange as an exchangeable value, but only
becomes that as the result of exchange.&gt; On the other
hand, the exchanged value of A is a definite quantity of
products B, C, D, etc.  Therefore (according to
Monsieur Ganilh) it is no longer a value, but a thing,
without exchange.  B, C, D, etc., were not
“values”.  A has become a value through
these non-values stepping into its place (as exchanged
value).  By the mere change of place—after they
have come out of exchange and find themselves in the same
position as before—these things have become
values.</p>
<p class="quote">“It is therefore neither the real
utility of things, nor their <i>intrinsic</i> value, which
makes them wealth; it is exchange which fixes and determines
their value, and it is this value which identifies them with
wealth” (l.c., p. 105).</p>
<p>Lord Exchange fixes and determines something which was
there or was not there.  If only exchange creates the
value of things, then this value, this product of exchange,
ceases to exist as soon as exchange itself ceases. 
Thus what it makes, it equally unmakes.  I exchange A
for B+C+D, In the act of this exchange A gets value. 
As soon as the act is past, B+C+D stands on the side where A
was, and A on the side where B+C+D was.  And in fact
each stands on its own, outside Lord Exchange, who only
consisted of this change of place.  B+C+D is now
things, not values.  So is A.  Or exchange
“fixes and determines” in the literal meaning of
the word.  A dynamometer determines and fixes the
degree of strength of my muscles, but it does not make
it.  In this case value is not produced by
exchange.</p>
<p class="quote">“There is in truth no wealth for
individuals and for peoples, except when each labours for
all” (that is to say, when his labour takes the form
of <i>general social labour</i>, for in any other meaning
this would be nonsense; since, except in the form of general
social labour, an iron manufacturer does not work for all,
but <i>only</i> for consumers of iron); “and all for
each” (which again is nonsense, if we are dealing with
use-value, for the products of all are without exception
special products, and each person needs only special
products; what this means is therefore only that each
special product takes on a form in which <i>it exists for
everyone;</i> and it only exists in this form, not because
as a special product it is distinct from the product of each
other person, but because it is identical with it; that is,
once more the form of social labour as it exists on the
basis of commodity production) (l.c., p. 408).</p>
<p><span class="context">||361|</span> From this
definition—exchange-value is the expression of the
labour of the isolated individual as general social
labour—Ganilh falls once more into the crudest
conception: that exchange-value is the proportion in which
commodity A exchanges against commodity B, C, D, etc. 
A has great exchange-value if much B, C, D is given for it;
but then little A is given for B, C, D.  Wealth
consists of exchange-value.  Exchange-value consists of
the relative proportion in which products exchange for each
other.  The total quantity of products has therefore no
exchange-value, since it is not exchanged for
anything.  Hence, society, whose wealth consists of
exchange-values, has no wealth.  Consequently it
follows not only, as Ganilh himself concludes, that the
“national wealth, which is composed of the
exchange-values of labour” (p.108), can never rise and
can never fall in exchange-value ( therefore there is <i>no
surplus-value</i>), but that it has no exchange-value
whatever, and so is not wealth, since wealth consists only
of exchangeable values.</p>
<p class="quote">“If the abundance of wheat makes
<i>its value fall</i>, the farmers will he less rich,
because they have less exchange-values to obtain for
themselves things that are necessary, useful or pleasant for
life; but the consumers of wheat will profit from all that
the farmers have lost: the loss of some will be compensated
by the gain of others, and the general wealth will undergo
no change” (pp. 108-09).</p>
<p>Excuse me.  The consumers of wheat eat the wheat and
not the exchangeable value of the wheat.  They are
richer in means of subsistence, but not in exchangeable
value.  They have exchanged a small amount of their
products—which have a high exchange-value because of
their relative paucity as compared with the quantity of
wheat for which they are exchanged—for the
wheat.  The farmers have now received the <i>high
exchange-value</i> and the consumers a good deal of wheat of
small exchange-value, so that now the latter are the poor
ones and the farmers the rich.</p>
<p>Moreover, the total (the social total of exchange-values)
loses its nature of being exchange-value in the same degree
as it becomes the total of exchange-values.  A, B, C,
D, E, F have exchange-value in so far as they are exchanged
for each other.  When they have been exchanged, they
are then all products for their consumers, their
purchasers.  By exchanging hands they have ceased to be
exchange-value.  And thereby the wealth of society,
which is composed of exchangeable values, has
disappeared.  The value of A is relative; it is its
exchange relation to B, C, etc.  A+B has less
exchange-value, because its exchange-value now exists only
in relation to C, D, E, F.  But the total of A, B, C,
D, E, F has no exchange-value at all, because it expresses
no relation.  The total of commodities is not exchanged
for other commodities.  Therefore the wealth of
society, which consists of exchange-values, has no
exchange-value and is consequently not wealth.</p>
<p class="quote">“Hence it is that it is difficult,
and perhaps impossible, for a country to enrich itself by
internal commerce.  It is not at all the same for
peoples who engage in foreign trade” (l.c.,
p. 109).</p>
<p>This is the old Mercantile system.  Value consists
in my getting not an equivalent, but more than the
equivalent.  At the same time, however, for Ganilh
there is no equivalent, for this would imply that the value
of A and the value of B are determined not by the proportion
of A in B or of B in A, but by a third thing in which A and
B are identical.  But if there is no equivalent, there
can also be no excess over the equivalent.  I get less
gold for iron than iron for gold.  Now I have more
iron, for which I get less gold.  If therefore I gain
on the original transaction because less gold is equal to
more iron, I now lose just as much because more iron is
equal to less gold.</p>
<p class="quote">“All labour, whatever be its nature,
is productive of wealth provided that it has an
exchange-value” (l.c., p. 119).  “Exchange
pays no regard either to the quantity or to the material
nature or to the durability of the products” (l.c.,
p. 121).  “All” (kinds of labour) “are
<i>equally productive</i> of the <i>sum</i> for which they
have been exchanged” (pp. 121-22).</p>
<p>First they are equally productive of the <i>sum</i>, that
is, the <i>price</i>, which they have been paid (the
<i>value</i> of their wages).  But Ganilh at once goes
another step further.  Immaterial labour, he says,
produces the material product for which it is exchanged, so
that it seems that material labour produces the product of
immaterial labour.</p>
<p><span class="context">||362|</span> “There is no
difference between the labour of the workman who makes a
chest of drawers for which he gets two bushels of wheat in
exchange and the labour of a village fiddler for which he
gets two bushels of wheat.  In both cases two bushels
of wheat are produced: two bushels to pay for the chest of
drawers, and two bushels to pay for the pleasure given by
the village fiddler.  It is true that after the joiner
has consumed the two bushels of wheat, a chest of drawers
remains, and after the fiddler has consumed the two bushels
of wheat, nothing remains; bet how many labours reputed
productive are in the same case!… it is net by what
remains after consumption that one can judge whether a
labour is productive or sterile, it is by <i>the exchange or
by the production to which it has given rise</i>.  But
since the joiner’s labour, as well as the fiddler’s labour,
<i>is the cause of the production of two bushels of wheat,
both are equally productive of two bushels of wheat</i>,
although the one, after it is finished, does not fix and
realise itself in any durable object, and the other fixes
and realises itself in a durable object” (l.c., pp.
122-23).</p>
<p class="quote">“Adam Smith would like to reduce the
number of labourers who are not usefully occupied, in order
to multiply that of the labourers who are usefully occupied;
but no consideration has been given to the fact that if this
desire could be realised all wealth would be impossible,
because consumers would be lacking for the producers, and
the excess that was not consumed would not be
reproduced.  The productive classes do not give the
products of their labours gratuitously <i>to the classes
whose labours do not yield any material products</i>”
(here he nevertheless himself distinguishes between labours
which yield material products and labours which do not);
“they give them to them in exchange for the
convenience, the pleasures and the enjoyments that they
receive from them, and, <i>in order to give them</i> to
<i>them, they are obliged to produce them</i>.  If the
material products of labour were not employed to pay for the
labours which do not yield material products, they would not
have consumers and their <i>reproduction</i> would cease,
The labours productive of enjoyment <i>thus contribute to
production as efficaciously</i> as the labour which is
considered to be the most productive” (l.c.,
pp. 123-24).</p>
<p class="quote">“Almost always the convenience, the
pleasures or the enjoyments which they” (the peoples)
“seek <i>follow</i> and <i>do not precede the products
which are to pay for them</i>” (l.c.,
p. <i>125</i>).  (They seem therefore to be much more
effect than cause of the products which are to pay for
them).  “The position is different when the pro
ours devoted to pleasure, luxury and ostentation <i>are not
wanted by the productive classes</i>, “ (thus he
himself makes the distinction here) “and they are
nevertheless <i>forced</i> to pay for them and to cut down
their own requirements by this amount.  Then it may
come about that this forced payment does not bring about an
increase in production” (l.c., p. 125). 
“Apart from this case all labour is necessarily
productive, and contributes more or less efficaciously to
the formation and growth of the public wealth, because <i>it
necessarily calls forth the products which pay for
it</i>” (l.c. p. 126).</p>
<p>&lt;So according to this the “unproductive
labours” are productive neither because of their cost,
that is, their exchange-value, nor because of the special
enjoyment that they produce, that is, their use-value, but
because they produce productive labour.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;If, according to Adam Smith, that labour is
productive which is directly exchanged for capital, then we
have to consider, apart from the form, also the material
components of the capital which is exchanged for
labour.  It resolves itself into the necessary means of
subsistence; that is for the most part into commodities,
material things.  What the labourer has to pay from
these wages to State and Church is a deduction for services
which are forced upon him; what he pays out for education is
devilishly little, but when he does, his payments are
productive, for education produces labour-power; what he
pays out for the services of physicians, lawyers, priests,
is his misfortune; there are very few unproductive labours
or services left on which the labourer’s wages are spent,
especially as he himself provides his costs of consumption
(cooking, keeping his house clean, generally even
repairs).&gt;</p>
<p>The following statement of Ganilh’s is extremely
characteristic:</p>
<p class="quote">“If exchange gives to the servant’s
labour a value of 1,000 francs, while it gives to that of
the husbandman or factory worker only a value of 500 francs,
one must conclude from this that the servant’s labour
contributes to the <i>production of wealth</i> twice as much
as that of the husbandman and the factory worker; and it
cannot be otherwise, as long as the labour of servants
receives in payment twice as much in material products as
the labour of husbandmen and factory workers.  How can
it be imagined that wealth results from labour which has
less exchange-value and which is consequently paid
less!” (l.c., pp. 293-94).</p>
<p><span class="context">||363|</span> If the wages of the
factory or agricultural labourer are 500 francs, and the
surplus-value (profit and rent) created by him is equal to
40 per cent, his net product would be 200 francs, and five
such labourers would be required to produce the wages of
1,000 francs for the servant.  If instead of the
servant Lord Exchange cared to buy a mistress for 10,000
francs annually, the net product of 50 such productive
labourers would be required.  And because her
unproductive labour brings in for the mistress twenty times
as much exchange-value, wages, as the wages of the
productive labourer, this person adds twenty times as much
to “the production of wealth”, and a country
produces the more wealth the higher it pays its servants and
mistresses.  Monsieur Ganilh forgets that only the
productivity of manufacturing and agricultural labour, only
the surplus created by the productive workers but not paid
to them, provides any fund at all for which the unproductive
labourers are paid.  But he reckons like this: 1,000
francs wage, and the labour of servant or mistress as
equivalent for the wage, make together 2,000 francs. 
The value of servants and mistresses, that is, their
production costs, depend entirely on the <i>net product</i>
of the productive labourers.  Indeed, their existence
as a special breed of people depends on it.  Their
price and their value have little in common with each
other.</p>
<p>But even assuming that the value (the costs of
production) of a servant is twice as great as that of a
productive labourer, it must be observed that the
productivity of a labourer (like that of a machine) and his
value are entirely different things, which are even in
inverse proportion to each other.  The value that a
machine costs is always a minus in relation to its
productivity.</p>
<p class="quote">“In vain is the objection raised that
if the labour of servants is as productive as that of
husbandmen and factory workers, there is no reason why the
public economy of a country should not be used to maintain
them, not only without being squandered but with a constant
increase of value.  This objection is only specious
because it assumes that the fruitfulness of each labour
results from its <i>co-operation in the production of
material objects, that material production is constitutive
of wealth and that production and wealth are completely
identical</i>.  It is forgotten that <i>all production
only becomes wealth concurrently with its
consumption</i>,<a href="#_ftn19" id="_ftnref19">*</a><i> and that exchange
determines up to what point it contributes to the formation
of wealth</i>.  If it is remembered that all labours
contribute directly or indirectly to the total production of
each country, that exchange, in fixing the value of each
labour, determines the part that it has had in this
production, that <i>consumption of the production</i>
realises the value that exchange has given it, and that the
surplus or deficit of production over consumption determines
the state of wealth or poverty of peoples, it will be
realised how inconsistent it is <i>to isolate</i> each
labour, to fix its fertility and its fruitfulness by its
<i>contribution to material production and without any
regard to its <span class="context">||364|</span>
consumption, which alone gives it a value</i>, a value
without which wealth cannot exist” (l.c.,
pp. 294-95).</p>
<p>On the one hand the fellow makes wealth depend on the
excess of production over consumption, on the other hand he
says that only consumption gives value.  And a servant
who consumes 1,000 francs consequently contributes twice as
much to the giving of value as a peasant who consumes 500
francs.</p>
<p>In the first place he admits that these unproductive
labours do not ‘directly participate in the formation
of material wealth.  Smith does not claim more than
this.  On the other hand he tries to prove that on the
contrary they create material wealth in the same measure as,
according to his own admission, they do not.</p>
<p>All those who polemise against Adam Smith on the one hand
assume a superior attitude to material production, and on
the other hand they attempt to justify immaterial
production—or even no production, like that of
lackeys—as material production.  It makes
absolutely no difference whether the owner of the net
revenue consumes this revenue in lackeys, mistresses or
pasties.  But it is ludicrous to imagine that the
surplus must be consumed by servants and cannot be consumed
by productive labourers themselves without the value of the
product going to the devil.  With Malthus too we find
the same view of the necessity of unproductive
consumers—which necessity in fact exists when the
surplus comes into the hands of idlers.  <span class="context">|364||</span></p>
<p><a id="s9"> </a></p>
<h3>[9.  Ganilh and Ricardo on Net Revenue. 
Ganilh as Advocate of a Diminution of the Productive
Population; Ricardo as Advocate of the Accumulation of
Capital and the Growth of Productive Forces]</h3>
<p><span class="context">||364|</span> <i>Ganilh</i> claims
to have put forward a theory in his <i>Théorie de
l’économie politique</i> (a book I don’t know) which
Ricardo later copied from him.  This theory is that
wealth depends on net product and not on gross product, and
thus on the level of profit and rent.  (This is
certainly not a discovery of Ganilh’s, who distinguishes
himself, however, by the way he puts it.)</p>
<p>Surplus-value presents itself (has its real existence) in
a surplus-produce in excess of the quantity of products
which only replace its original elements, that is, which
enter into its production costs and—taking constant
and variable capital together—are equal to the total
capital advanced to production.  The aim of capitalist
production is the surplus, not the product.  The
labourer’s necessary labour-time, and therefore also its
equivalent in the product with which it is paid for, is only
necessary as long as it produces surplus-labour. 
Otherwise it is <i>unproductive</i> for the capitalist.</p>
<p>The surplus-value is equal to the rate of surplus-value
<i>s/v</i> multiplied by the number of simultaneous days’
labour or the number of employed labourers, that is, by
<i>n</i>.  So S= <i>s/v</i> × <i>n</i>. 
This surplus-value can therefore be increased or reduced in
two ways.  For example, (<i>s/v)/2×n</i> is equal
to <i>2s/v × n</i>=2S.  Here S <span class="context">||365|</span> has doubled, because the rate
has doubled, since (<i>s/v)/2</i> is <i>2s/v</i>, that is,
is twice as much as <i>s/v</i>.  On the other hand,
however <i>s/v × 2n</i> would also be equal to
<i>2sn/v</i>, that is, also equal to 2S.  V, the
variable capital, is equal to the p rice of the single day’s
labour multiplied by the number of labourers employed. 
If 800 labourers are employed, each costing £1, then
V=£800, that is, £1 × 800, where
<i>n</i>=800.  Then if the surplus-value is 160, its
rate would be <sup class="ratio">160</sup>/<sub class="ratio">(£1×800)</sub>
= <sup class="ratio">160</sup>/<sub class="ratio">800</sub> =
<sup class="ratio">16</sup>/<sub class="ratio">80</sub> = <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">5</sub> = 20
per cent.  But the surplus-value itself is
<sup class="ratio">160</sup>/<sub class="ratio">(£1×800)</sub> × 800,
that is,
<sup class="ratio">£S</sup>/<sub class="ratio">£1×<i>n</i></sub>×
<i>n</i>.</p>
<p>With a given length of labour-time, this surplus-value
can only be increased by an increase of productivity, or at
a given level of productivity, by a lengthening of the
labour-time.</p>
<p>But what concerns us here is: <i>2S=[(s/v)/2</i>]
×<i> n</i>; and 2S=<i>s/v</i> × 2<i>n</i>.</p>
<p>The surplus-value (gross amount of surplus-value) remains
the same, if the number of labourers is reduced by
half—is only <i>n</i> instead of 2<i>n</i>, but the
surplus-labour performed by them each day is twice as much
as it was before.  On this assumption, therefore, two
things would remain the same: first, the total quantity of
products produced; secondly, the total quantity of
surplus-produce or net product.  But the following
would have changed: first, the variable capital, or the part
of the circulating capital expended in wages, would have
fallen by half.  The part of the constant capital which
consists of raw materials would also remain unchanged, as
the same quantity of raw material as before would be worked
up, although this would be done by half the labourers
employed before.  As against this, the part which
consists of fixed capital has increased.</p>
<p>If the capital expended in wages was £300 (£1
per labourer), it would now be £150.  If that
expended in raw materials was £310, it would now be
£310.  If the value of the machinery was four
times as much as the rest of the capital, it would now be
£1,600.  Therefore if the machinery is worn out
in ten years, the machinery entering annually into the
product would be £160.  We will assume that the
capital previously expended annually on instruments was
£40, thus only <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">4</sub>, Then the
account would stand:</p>

<p><span class="context">||366|</span> [We find in
Ganilh:]</p>
<p class="quote">“When a country is deprived of
the aid of machines, and its labour is carried out by hand,
the labouring classes consume almost the whole of their
production.  To the degree that industry makes
progress, is improved by the division of labour, the skill
of the workmen, and the invention of machines, the costs of
production diminish, <i>or</i> in other words, a smaller
number of labourers is required to obtain a greater
production” (l.c., t. 1, pp. 211-12).</p>
<p>That is to say, therefore, in the same degree as industry
becomes more productive, the production costs of wages are
reduced.  Fewer labourers are employed in relation to
the product, and these therefore also consume a smaller part
of the product.</p>
<p>If a labourer without machinery needs 10 hours to produce
his own means of subsistence, and if with machinery he only
needs 6, then (with 12 hours’ labour) in the first case he
works 10 for himself and 2 for the capitalist, and the
capitalist gets one-sixth of the total product of the 12
hours.  In the first case 10 labourers will produce a
product for 10 labourers (equal to 100 hours) and 20 [hours]
for the capitalist.  Of the value of 120, the
capitalist gets one-sixth, or 20.  In the second case,
5 labourers will produce a product for 5 Labourers (equal to
30 hours), and for the capitalist 30 hours.  Of the 60
hours the capitalist now gets 30, that is, one half—3
times as much as before, The total surplus-value too would
have risen, namely from 20 to 30, by
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>.  When I appropriate one-half
of 60 days, this is one-third more than when I appropriate
one-sixth of 120 days.</p>
<p>Moreover, the one-half of the total product that the
capitalist gets is also greater in quantity than
before.  For 6 hours now produce as much product as 10
did before; 1 [hour] as much as ten-sixths of an hour
[before], or 1 as much as 1 <sup class="ratio">4</sup>/<sub class="ratio">6</sub>=1
<sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>, So the 30 surplus hours contain
as much product as did previously 30
(1+<sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>) = 30 +
<sup class="ratio">60</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> = 50.  6 hours produce as
much product as 10 did previously, that is, 30—or
5×6—produce as much as 5×10 did
before.</p>
<p>The capitalist’s surplus-value would therefore have risen
and also his surplus-product (if he consumes it himself, or
as much of it as he consumes in kind).  The
surplus-value can even rise without the quantity of the
total product being increased.  For the increase of
surplus-value means that the labourer is able to produce his
means of subsistence in less time than before, that
therefore the value of the commodities he consumes falls,
represents less labour-time, and that therefore a certain
value, equal to 6 hours for example, represents a greater
quantity of the use-values than before.  The labourer
receives the same quantity of product as before, but this
quantity forms a smaller part of the total product, as its
value expresses a smaller part of the fruits of the day’s
labour.  Although an increase in productive power in
the branches of industry whose product neither directly nor
indirectly enters into the formation of the labourer’s means
of consumption could not have this result—since
increased or reduced productivity in these branches does not
affect the relation between the necessary and the
surplus-labour—the result for these industries would
nevertheless be the same, although it did not originate from
a change in their own productivity.  The relative value
of their products would rise in exactly the same proportion
as that of the other commodities had fallen (if their own
productivity had remained the same); consequently, a
proportionately smaller aliquot part of these products, or a
smaller part of the labour-time of the labourer which is
materialised in them, would procure for him the same
quantity of means of subsistence as before.  The
surplus-value would therefore rise in these branches of
labour just as in the others.</p>
<p>But what will then become of the five displaced
labourers?</p>
<p>It will be said that capital has also been released,
namely, that which paid the five dismissed workers, who each
received 10 hours (f or which they worked 12), that is, 50
hours in all, which could previously have paid the wages of
five labourers and which [now] that wages have fallen to 6
hours can pay for <sup class="ratio">50</sup>/<sub class="ratio">6</sub> = 8
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">2</sub> days’ labour.  Therefore now
the capital of 50 [hours’] labour that has been released can
employ more labourers than have been dismissed.</p>
<p>But a capital equivalent to the whole 50 hours’ labour
has not been released.  For even assuming that the raw
material has become cheaper in the same proportion as the
increase in the quantity of it that is worked up in the same
labour-time—that is, assuming that the same increase
of productivity has taken place in that branch of production
—the outlay for the new machinery nevertheless
remains.  Assuming that this costs exactly 50 hours’
labour, it has certainly in no case employed as many
labourers as were put off.  For this 50 hours’ labour
was laid out entirely in wages, for 5 labourers.  But
in the value of the machine, equivalent to 50 hours’ labour,
both profit and wages are contained, both paid and unpaid
labour-time.  In addition, constant capital enters into
the value of the machine.  The number of
machine-building labourers [who built the machine is]
smaller than the number of labourers discharged; nor are
they the same individuals <span class="context">||367|</span> as those discharged.  The
greater demand for labourers in machine building can at most
affect the future distribution of the number of labourers,
so that a larger part of the generation entering the
labour-market—a larger part than before—turns to
that branch of industry.  It does not affect those who
have been discharged.  Moreover the increase in the
annual demand for these is not equal to the new capital
expended on machinery.  The machine lasts for example
for ten years.  The constant demand which it creates is
therefore equal annually to <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">10</sub> of
the wages contained in it.  To this
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">10</sub> must be added labour for repairs
during the 10 years, and the daily consumption of coal, oil
and other auxiliary materials; which in all amounts perhaps
to another <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">10</sub>.</p>
<p>&lt;If the capital released were equal to 60 hours, these
would now represent 10 hours’ surplus-labour and only 50
necessary labour.  Thus if previously the 60 hours had
been expended in wages and 6 labourers had been employed,
now it would be only 5.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;The shifting of labour and capital which increased
productivity in a particular branch of industry brings about
by means of machinery, etc., is always only
prospective.  That is to say, <i>the increase, the new
number of labourers entering industry</i>, is distributed in
a different way; perhaps the children of those who have been
thrown out, but not these themselves.  They themselves
vegetate for a long time in their old trade, which they
carry on under the most unfavourable conditions, inasmuch as
their necessary labour-time is greater than the socially
necessary labour-time; they become paupers, or find
employment in branches of industry where a lower grade of
labour is employed.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;A pauper, like a capitalist (<i>rentier</i>), lives
on the revenue of the country.  He does not enter into
the production costs of the product, and consequently
Monsieur Ganilh would call him a representative of
exchangeable value.  Ditto, for a criminal who is fed
in prison.  A large part of the “unproductive
labourers”, holders of State sinecures, etc., are
simply respectable paupers.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Assume that the productivity of industry is so
advanced that whereas earlier two-thirds of the population
were directly engaged in material production, now it is only
one-third.  Previously <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>
produced means of subsistence for <sup class="ratio">3</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>;
now <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> produce for
<sup class="ratio">3</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>.  Previously
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> was net revenue (as distinct from
the revenue of the labourers), now
<sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>.  Leaving [class]
contradictions out of account, the nation would now use
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> of its time for direct production,
where previously it needed <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>. 
Equally distributed, all [that is, the whole population]
would have <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> more time for
unproductive labour and leisure.  But in capitalist
production everything seems and in fact is
contradictory.  The assumption does not imply that the
population is stagnant.  For if the
<sup class="ratio">3</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> grow, so also do the
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>; thus, <i>measured in
quantity</i>, a larger number of people could he employed in
productive labour.  But relatively, in proportion to
the total population, it would always be 50 per cent less
than before.  Those two-thirds of the population
consist partly of the owners of profit and rent, partly of
unproductive labourers (who also, owing to competition, are
badly paid).  The latter help the former to consume the
revenue and give them in return an equivalent in
services—or impose their services on them, like the
political unproductive labourers.  It can be supposed
that—with the exception of the horde of flunkeys, the
soldiers, sailors, police, lower officials and so on,
mistresses, grooms, clowns and jugglers—these
unproductive labourers will on the whole have a higher level
of culture than the unproductive workers had previously, and
in particular that ill-paid artists, musicians, lawyers,
physicians, scholars, schoolmasters, inventors, etc., will
also have increased in number.</p>
<p>Within the productive class itself commercial middlemen
will have multiplied, but in particular those engaged in
machine construction, railway construction, mining and
excavation; moreover, in agriculture labourers engaged in
stock-raising will have increased in number, and also those
employed in producing chemical and mineral materials for
fertilisers, etc.  Further, the farmers who grow raw
materials for industry will have risen in number, in
proportion to those producing means of subsistence; and
those who provide fodder for cattle, in proportion to those
who produce means of subsistence for people.  <i>As the
constant capital grows, so also does the proportionate
quantity of the total labour which is engaged in its
reproduction</i>.  Nevertheless, the part [of the
population] directly producing means of subsistence,
although its number declines, <span class="context">||368|</span> produces more products than
before.  Its labour is more productive.  <i>While
for the individual capital the fall in the variable part of
the capital as compared with the constant part</i> takes the
direct form of a reduction in the part of the capital
expended in wages, for the total capital—in its
<i>reproduc</i><i>tion</i>—this necessarily takes the
form that a relatively greater part of the total labour
employed is engaged in the reproduction of means of
production than is engaged in the production of products
themselves—that is, in the reproduction of machinery
(including means of communication and transport and
buildings), of auxiliary materials (coal, gas, oil, tallow,
leather belting, etc.) and of plants which form the raw
material for industrial products.  Relatively to the
manufacturing labourers, agricultural labourers will decline
in number.  Finally the luxury, labourers will increase
in number, since the higher revenue will consume more luxury
products.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;The variable capital is resolved into revenue,
firstly wages, secondly profit.  If therefore capital
is conceived as something contrasted with revenue, the
constant capital appears to be capital <i>in the strict
sense:</i> the part of the total product that belongs to
production and enters into the costs of production without
being individually consumed by anyone (with the exception of
draught cattle).  This part may originate entirely from
profit and wages.  In the last analysis, it can never
originate from these alone; it is the product of labour, but
of labour which regarded the instrument of production itself
as revenue, as the savage did the bow.  But once
transformed into constant capital, this part of the product
is no longer resolvable into wages and profit, although its
reproduction yields wages and profit.  A part of the
product belongs to this part.  Each subsequent product
is the product of this past labour and of present
labour.  The latter can only be continued in <i>so</i>
far as it returns a part of the total product to
production.  It must replace the constant capital in
kind.  If it grows more productive, it replaces the
product, but not its value, reducing this value as a
result.  If it grows less productive, it raises its
value.  In the first case the aliquot part drawn by
past labour from the total product falls; in the second case
it rises.  In the first case the living labour becomes
more productive, in the second, less productive.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;The factors which reduce the costs of the <i>constant
capital</i>, also include improved raw materials.  For
example, it is not possible to make the same quantity of
twist in the same time both from good and from had raw
cotton, leaving entirely out of account the relative
quantity of waste, etc.  Hence the importance of the
quality of seed, etc.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;As an example <i>combination</i> where a manufacturer
himself makes a part of his former constant capital, or
where previously the raw material passed as constant capital
out of his sphere of production into a second sphere, and he
now himself gives it the second form—this always only
amounts to a concentration of profits, as was shown
earlier.  <i>An example of the first:</i> the linking
together of spinning and weaving.  <i>An example of the
second:</i> the mine owners of Birmingham, who took over the
<i>complete</i> process of making iron, which had formerly
been divided between a number of entrepreneurs and
owners.&gt;</p>
<h4>***</h4>
<p>Ganilh continues:</p>
<p class="quote">“So long as the division of labour is
not established in all branches, so long as all classes of
the labouring and industrious population have not attained
their full development, the invention of machines, and their
employment in certain industries, only cause the capitals
and labourers displaced by the machines to flow into other
employments which can usefully employ them.  But
<i>it</i> is evident that when all branches of employment
have the capital and the labourers they require, every
further improvement and every new machine that cuts down
labour, necessarily reduces the labouring population: and as
this reduction does not diminish production, the part which
it leaves available accrues either to the profit of capitals
or to the rent of land; and in consequence the natural and
necessary effect of machines is to diminish the population
of the wage-earning classes who live on the gross product,
and to increase the population of the classes which live on
the net product” (l.c., p.  212).</p>
<p><span class="context">||369|</span> “<i>The
displacement of the population</i> of a country, a
<i>necessary consequence of the progress of industry</i>, is
the true cause of the prosperity, the power and the
civilisation of modern peoples.  The more the lower
classes of society decrease in number, the less need it be
troubled by the dangers to which the distress, the
ignorance, the credulity and the superstition of these
unfortunate classes ceaselessly expose it; the more the
upper classes multiply, the more subjects the State has at
its disposal, the stronger and more powerful it is, the more
knowledge, intelligence and civilisation there is in the
whole population” (l.c., p. 213).</p>
<p>&lt;<i>Say</i> makes the total value of the product
resolvable into revenue in the following way: in the
Constancio translation of Ricardo’s [book
<i>Principles</i>], Chapter 26, he says in a note:</p>
<p class="quote">“The net revenue of an individual
consists of <i>the value of the product</i> to which he has
contributed … less his disbursements; but as the
disbursements that he has made are <i>portions of
revenue</i> which he has paid to others, <i>the totality of
the value of the product has served to pay
revenues</i>.  The total revenue of a nation is
composed of its gross product, that is to say, of the gross
value of all its products which are distributed among the
producers.”</p>
<p>The last sentence would be correct if expressed in this
way:</p>
<p>The total revenue of a nation is composed of that part of
its gross product, that is to say, of the gross value of all
the products which are distributed as revenues among the
producers, that is to say, less that portion of all the
products which in each branch of industry had replaced the
means of production.  But so expressed, the sentence
would negate itself.</p>
<p>Say continues:</p>
<p class="quote">“This value, after many exchanges,
would he entirely consumed in the year which saw its birth,
but it would nonetheless he still the revenue of the nation;
just as an individual who has 20,000 francs annual revenue
has nonetheless 20,000 francs annual revenue, although he
consumes it entirely each year.  His revenue does not
consist only of his savings.”</p>
<p>His revenue never consists of his savings, although his
savings always consist of his revenues.  To prove that
a nation can annually consume both its capital and its
revenue, Say compares it to an individual who leaves his
capital intact and only consumes his revenue each
year.  If this individual consumed in a single year
both his capital of 200,000 francs and the revenue of
20,000, he would have nothing to eat the year after. 
If the entire capital of a nation, and consequently the
entire gross value of its products, consisted of revenues,
Say would be right.  The individual consumes his 20,000
francs revenue.  His 200,000 francs capital, which he
does not consume, would be composed of the revenues of other
individuals, each of whom consumes his share, and thus, at
the end of the year, the whole capital would be
consumed.  But perhaps it would be reproduced while it
is consumed, and thus replaced?  But the individual in
question reproduces annually his revenue of 20,000 francs,
because he has not consumed his capital of 200,000
francs.  The others have consumed this capital. 
Then they have no capital with which to reproduce
revenue.&gt;</p>
<p class="quote">“Only the <i>net product</i>,”
says Ganilh, “and those who consume it form its”
(the State’s) “wealth and its power, and contribute to
its prosperity, its glory and its grandeur” (l.c.,
p. 218).</p>
<p>Ganilh further cites Say’s notes to Constancio’s
translation of Ricardo [<i>Principles</i>,] Chapter XXVI,
where Ricardo says that if a country has 12 million
[inhabitants], it would be more advantageous for it if 5
million productive labourers labour for the 12 million, than
if 7 million productive labourers labour for the 12
million.  In the first case the net product consists of
the surplus-produce on which the 7 million who are not
productive live; in the other, of a surplus-produce for 5
million.  Say remarks on this:</p>
<p class="quote">“This is quite like the doctrine of
the Economists of the eighteenth century, who maintained
that manufactures in no way helped towards the wealth of the
State, because the <i>wage-earning class</i>, consuming a
value equal to <span class="context">||370|</span> that
which they produce, contribute nothing to their famous
<i>net product</i>.” “</p>
<p>On this, Ganilh observes (pp. 219-20):</p>
<p class="quote">“It is not easy to see any connection
between the Economists’ assertion <i>that the industrial
class consumes a value equal to that which it produces</i>
and the doctrine of Mr.  Ricardo, <i>that the wages of
labourers cannot be counted in the revenue of a
State</i>.”</p>
<p>Here too Ganilh misses the point.  The Economists go
wrong in regarding the manufacturers as only <i>wage-earning
classes</i>.  This distinguishes them from
Ricardo.  They are further wrong in thinking that the
<i>wage-earners</i> produce what they consume.  The
correct view, as Ricardo in contrast to them knew very well,
is that it is they who produce the net product, but produce
it precisely because their consumption, that is to say their
wage, is equal not to the time they labour, but to the
labour-time that they have put in to produce this wage; that
is, that they receive a share of the product only equal to
their necessary consumption, or that they receive only as
much of their own product as is equivalent to their own
necessary consumption.  The Economists assumed that the
whole industrial class (masters and workmen) was in this
position.  They considered that only rent bore the
character of an excess of production over wages, and
consequently that it was the only wealth.  But when
Ricardo says that profits and rents form this surplus and
are consequently the only wealth, in spite of his difference
from the Physiocrats, he agrees with them in thinking that
only the net product, the product in which the surplus-value
exists, forms the national wealth; although he has a better
understanding of the nature of this surplus.  For him,
too, it is only the part of the revenue which is in excess
of wages.  What distinguishes him from the Economists
is not his explanation of the net product, but his
explanation of wages, under which category the Economists
wrongly also include profits.</p>
<p>Say also remarks in opposition to Ricardo:</p>
<p class="quote">“From seven million fully employed
labourers there would be more savings than from five
million.”</p>
<p>Ganilh rightly observes, refuting this:</p>
<p class="quote">“That is to suppose that <i>economies
from wages</i> are preferable to the econ<i>omy which
results from the reduction of wages</i>…  It
would be too absurd to pay four hundred millions in wages to
labourers who give no net product, in order to provide them
with the opportunity and the means for making economies on
their wages” (l.c., p. 221).</p>
<p class="quote">“With every step made by
civilisation, labour becomes less burdensome and more
productive; the classes condemned to produce and to consume
diminish; and the classes which direct labour, which relieve
(!), console (!)  and enlighten the whole population,
multiply, <i>become more numerous and appropriate to
themselves all the benefits which result from the diminution
of the costs of labour</i>, from the abundance
of products and the cheapness of consumer goods.  In
this way, the human race lifts itself up… 
Because of this <i>progressive tendency to the diminution of
the lower classes of society and the increase of the upper
classes</i> … civil society becomes more prosperous,
more powerful,” etc, (l.c., p. 224).  “If
… the number of labourers employed is seven millions,
the wages will be fourteen hundred millions; but if the
fourteen hundred millions do not yield a larger net product
than the thousand millions paid to the five million
labourers, <i>the real economy would be in abolishing the
four hundred millions in wages paid to two million labourers
who yield no net product</i>, and not in the savings that
these two million labourers could make from the four hundred
millions of wages” (l.c., p. 221).</p>
<p>In Chapter XXVI [of his <i>Principles</i>] Ricardo
observes:</p>
<p class="quote">“<i>Adam Smith</i> constantly
magnifies the advantages which a country derives from a
large gross, rather than a large net income… 
What would be the advantage resulting to a country from the
employment of a great quantity of productive labour, if,
whether it employed that quantity or a smaller, its net rent
and profits together would be the same?  “
Whether a nation employs five or seven million productive
labourers to produce the net revenue <span class="context">||371|</span> on which five million others
live, “the food and clothing of five millions would be
still the net revenue.  The employing of a greater
number of men would enable us neither to add a man to our
army and navy, nor to contribute one guinea more in
taxes” (l.c., p. 215).</p>
<p>This reminds us of the ancient Germans, of whom one part
in turn took the field and the other cultivated the
field.  The smaller the number that was indispensable
for cultivating the field, the greater the number who were
able to war.  It would not have helped them if the
number of people had increased by one-third, so that instead
of 1,000 they had 1,500, if 1,000 were then required to
cultivate the field while previously it was 500.  Their
disposable forces would have consisted of only 500 men both
before and after.  If on the other hand the
productivity of their labour had increased, so that 250
sufficed to cultivate the field, 750 of the 1,000 could have
taken the field, whereas in the opposite case, if the
productivity of their labour had fallen, it would be only
500 out of the 1,500.</p>
<p>First it should be noted here that Ricardo means by net
revenue or net product not the excess of the total product
over the part of it that must be returned to production as
means of production, raw materials or instruments.  On
the contrary, he shares the false view that the gross
product consists of gross revenue.  By net product or
net revenue he means the surplus-value, the excess of the
total revenue over the part of it that consists of wages, of
the revenue of the labourers.  This revenue of the
labourer, however, is equal to the variable capital, the
part of the circulating capital which he is constantly
consuming and constantly reproducing as the part of his
production which he himself consumes.</p>
<p>If Ricardo treats the capitalists as not entirely
useless, that is to say, as themselves agents of production,
and therefore resolves a part of their profit into wages, he
has to deduct a part of their revenue from the net revenue
and to declare that all these persons only contribute to
wealth in so far as their wages form the smallest possible
part of their profit.  However that may be, at least a
part of their time as agents of production belongs, like a
fixture, to production itself.  And to this extent they
cannot be used for other purposes of society or of the
State.  The more free time their duties as managers of
production leave them, the more is their profit independent
of their wage.  In contrast to these, the capitalists
who live only on their interest, and also the landlords who
live on rent, are in person entirely at the disposal [of
society and the State], and no part of their income enters
into the costs of production—except for that part
which is used for the reproduction of their own worthy
person.  Ricardo should therefore have also desired, in
the interests <i>of the State</i>, a growth of rent (the
pure net revenue) at the cost of profits; but this is not at
all his viewpoint.  And why not?  Because it
hinders the accumulation of capitals [or]—what is in
part the same thing—because it increases the number of
unproductive labourers at the cost of the productive.</p>
<p>Ricardo fully shares Adam Smith’s view of the distinction
between productive and unproductive labour, that the former
exchanges its labour directly for capital, [the latter I
directly for revenue.  But he no longer shares Smith’s
tenderness for and illusion about the productive
labourer.  It is a misfortune to be a productive
labourer.  A productive labourer is a labourer who
produces wealth <i>for another</i>.  His existence only
has meaning as such an instrument of production for the
wealth of others.  If therefore the same quantity of
wealth for others can be created with a smaller number of
productive labourers, then the suppression of these
productive labourers is in order.  <i>Vos</i><i>, non
vobis</i>.<a href="#_ftn20" id="_ftnref20">*</a> Ricardo, incidentally, does not
think of this <i>suppression</i> as Ganilh does—that
through mere suppression the revenue increases and that what
was <i>formerly consumed as variable capital</i> (that is,
in the form of wages) would then be consumed <i>as
revenue</i>.  With the diminution in the number of
productive workers also disappears the amount of product
which those who have been discharged themselves consumed and
themselves produced—their equivalent.  Ricardo
does not assume, as Ganilh does, that the same quantity of
products as before is produced; but the same quantity of net
product.  If the labourers consumed 200 and their
surplus was 100, the total product was 300, and the surplus
was one third=100.  If the labourers consume 100 and
their surplus is 100 as before, the total product is 200 and
the surplus is one half=100.  The total product would
have fallen by one-third— by the quantity of products
consumed by the 100 dismissed workers, and the net product
<span class="context">||372|</span> [would have] remained
<i>the same</i>, because <sup class="ratio">200</sup>/<sub class="ratio">2</sub> =
<sup class="ratio">300</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>.  For Ricardo, therefore,
the amount of the gross product does not matter, provided
that that portion of the gross product which constitutes the
net product remains the same or grows, but in any case does
not diminish.</p>
<p>So he says:</p>
<p class="quote">“To an individual with a capital of
20,000 <i>l</i>., whose profits were 2,000 <i>1</i>. per
annum, it would be a matter quite indifferent whether his
capital would employ a hundred or a thousand men, whether
the commodity produced sold for 10,000 <i>l</i>., or for
20,000 <i>l</i>., provided, in all cases, his profits were
not diminished below 2,000 <i>l</i>.  Is not the real
interest of the nation similar?  <span class="context">|VIII-372||</span></p>
<h4>***</h4>
<p><span class="context">||IX - 377 |</span> The passage in
Ricardo (Chapter XXVI) runs:</p>
<p class="quote">“Adam Smith constantly magnifies the
advantages which a country derives from a large gross,
rather than a large net income” (because, says Adam,
“the greater will he the quantity of productive labour
which it puts into motion”)   “What
would be the advantage resulting to a country from the
employment of a great quantity of productive labour, if,
whether it employed that quantity or a smaller, its net rent
and profits together would be the same.“</p>
<p>&lt;This therefore means nothing but: if the
surplus-value produced by a greater quantity of labour would
be the same as that produced by a smaller quantity. 
That however in turn means nothing but that it is the same
thing for a country whether it employs a large number of
labourers at a lower rate of surplus or a smaller number at
a higher rate.  <i>n</i> ×
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">2</sub> is just as much as 2<i>n</i>
× <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">4</sub>, where <i>n</i> represents
the number [of labourers] and <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">2</sub> and
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">4</sub> the surplus-labour, The
“productive labourer “ as such is a mere
instrument of production for the production of surplus, and
if the result is the same a larger number of these
“productive labourers” would be a
nuisance.&gt;</p>
<p class="quote">“To an individual with a capital of
20,000 <i>l</i>., whose profits were 2,000 <i>l</i>. per
annum, it would be a matter quite indifferent whether his
capital would employ a hundred or a thousand men, whether
the commodity produced sold for 10,000 l or for 20,000
<i>l</i>. provided, in all cases, his profits were not
diminished below 2,000 <i>1</i>.”</p>
<p>&lt;The meaning of this, as is evident from a later
passage, is perfectly banal.  For example, a
wine-merchant, who makes use of £20,000 and has
£12,000 lying in his cellar each year, but sells
£8,000 for £10,000, employs few people and makes
10 per cent profit, etc.  And then take
bankers!&gt;</p>
<p> “Is not the real interest of the nation
similar?  <i>Provided its net real income, its rent and
profits be the same, it is of no importance whether the
nation consists of ten or of twelve millions of
inhabitants.  Its power of sup-porting fleets and
armies, and all species of unproductive labour</i>”
(this passage shows among other things that Ricardo shared
Adam Smith’s view of productive and unproductive labour,
although he did no longer share Smith’s tenderness, based on
illusions, for the productive labourer) “must be in
proportion to its net, and not in proportion to its gross,
income.  If five millions of men could produce as much
food and clothing as was necessary for ten millions, food
and clothing for five millions would be the net
revenue.  Would it be of any advantage to the country,
that <i>to produce this same net revenue</i>, seven millions
of men should be required, that is to say, that seven
millions should be employed to produce food and clothing
sufficient for twelve millions?  The food and clothing
of five millions would be still the net revenue.  The
employing a greater number of men would enable us neither to
add a man to our army and navy, nor to contribute one guinea
more in taxes” (Ricardo, <i>On the Principles of
Political Economy and Taxation</i>, 3rd edition, London,
1821, pp. 415-17).</p>
<p>A country is the richer the smaller its productive
population is <i>relatively</i> to the total product; just
as for the individual capitalist: the fewer labourers he
needs to produce the same surplus, so much the better for
him.  The country is the richer the smaller the
productive population in relation to the unproductive, the
quantity of products remaining the same.  For the
relative smallness of the productive population would be
only another way of expressing the relative degree of the
productivity of labour.</p>
<p>On the one hand it is the tendency of capital to reduce
to a dwindling minimum the labour-time necessary for the
production of commodities, and therefore also the number of
the productive population <i>in relation to</i> the amount
of the product.  On the other hand, however, it<a href="#_ftn21" id="_ftnref21">*</a> has the opposite
tendency to accumulate, to transform profit into capital, to
appropriate the greatest possible quantity of the labour of
others.  It<a href="#_ftn22" id="_ftnref22">*</a>
 strives to reduce the norm of necessary labour, but to
employ the greatest possible quantity of productive labour
at the given norm.  The proportion of the products to
the population makes no difference in this.  Corn and
cotton can be changed into wine, diamonds, etc., <span class="context">||378|</span> or labourers can be employed
in productive labour which does not directly add anything to
the (consumable) products (such as railway construction,
etc.).</p>
<p>If as the result of an invention a capitalist can now
only use in his business £10,000 instead of the
£20,000 he used previously, because £10,000 is
sufficient, and if this sum yields 20 per cent for him
instead of 10, that is, as much as the £20,000 brought
in before, this would be no reason for him to spend
£10,000 as revenue instead of as capital as
before.  (Actually it is only in the case of State
loans that we can speak of a direct transformation of
capital into revenue.) He would place it elsewhere—and
in addition would capitalise a part of his profit.</p>
<p>Among the economists (including Ricardo in part) we find
the same antimony as there is in reality.  Machinery
displaces labour and increases the net revenue (particularly
always what Ricardo here calls net revenue—the
quantity of products in which revenue is consumed); it
reduces the number of labourers and increases the products
(which then are partly consumed by unproductive labourers,
partly exchanged abroad, etc.).  So this would be
desirable.  But no.  In that case it must be shown
that machinery does not deprive the labourers of
bread.  And how is this to be shown?  By the fact
that after a shock (to which perhaps the section of the
population which is directly affected cannot offer any
resistance) machinery once again employs more people than
were employed before it was introduced—and therefore
once again increases the number of “productive
labourers” and restores the former disproportion.</p>
<p>That is in fact what happens.  And so in spite of
the growing productivity of labour the labouring population
could constantly grow not in proportion to the product,
which grows with it and faster than it, but proportionately
[to the total population], if, for example, capital
simultaneously becomes concentrated, and therefore former
component parts of the productive classes fall into the
ranks of the proletariat.  A small part of the latter
rises into the middle class.  The unproductive classes,
however, see to it that there is not too much food
available.  The constant retransformation of profit
into capital always restores the same cycle on a wider
basis.</p>
<p>And Ricardo’s care for accumulation is even greater than
his care for net profit, which he regards with fervent
admiration as a means to accumulation.  Hence too his
contradictory admonitions and consoling remarks to the
labourers.  They are the people most interested in the
accumulation of capital, because it is on this that the
demand for them depends.  If this demand rises, then
the price of labour rises.  They must therefore
themselves desire the lowering of wages, so that the surplus
taken from them, once more filtered through capital, is
returned to them for new labour and their wages rise. 
This rise in wages however is bad, because it restricts
accumulation.  On the one hand they must not produce
children.  This brings a fall in the supply of labour,
and so its price rises.  But this rise diminishes the
rate of accumulation, and so diminishes the demand for them
and brings down the price of labour.  Even quicker than
the supply of them falls, capital falls along with it. 
If they produce children, then they increase their own
supply and reduce the price of labour; thus the rate of
profit rises, and with it the accumulation of capital. 
But the labouring population must rise in the same degree as
the accumulation of capital; that is to say, the labouring
population must be there exactly in the numbers that the
capitalist needs—which it does anyway.</p>
<p>Monsieur Ganilh is not altogether consistent in his
admiration for the net product.  He quotes from
Say:</p>
<p class="quote">“I do not doubt at all (…)
that in slave labour the excess of the products over
consumption is larger than in the labour of a free
man…  The worker of the slave has no limit hut
his capacity.  … The slave” (and the free
work too) “<i>labours for an unlimited need: his
master’s cupidity” (Say</i>, 1re éd., pp. 215,
216).</p>
<p><span class="context">||379 |</span> On this Ganilh
observes:</p>
<p class="quote">“The free labourer cannot consume
more and produce less than the slave…  All
consumption presumes an equivalent produced to pay for
it.  If the free labourer consumes more than the slave,
the products of his labour must he more considerable than
those of the slave’s labour” (<i>Ganilh</i>, t. I, p.
234).</p>
<p>As if the size of the wage depended <i>only</i> on the
productivity of the labourer, and not, with a given
productivity, on the division of the product between
labourer and master.</p>
<p class="quote">“I know,” he continues,
“that it can be said with some reason that the
<i>economies made by the master at the expense of the
slave</i>” (according to this there are after all
economies made on the wages of the slave) “serve to
augment his personal expenses,” etc.  “But
it is more advantageous to the general wealth that there
should be well-being in all classes of society rather than
no excessive opulence among a small number of
individuals” (pp. 234-35).</p>
<p>How does that tally with the net product?  And for
that matter Monsieur Ganilh at once retracts his liberal
tirades (l.c., pp. 236-37).  He wants Nigger-slavery
for the colonies, He is only liberal in so far as he does
not want to reintroduce it into Europe, having grasped that
the free labourers here are slaves, that they only exist to
produce net product for capitalists, landlords and their
retainers.</p>
<p class="quote">“He” (<i>Quesnay</i>)
“definitely denies that economies made by the
wage-earning classes have the faculty to increase capital;
and the reason he gives for this is that these classes
should not have any means on which to make economics, and
that if they had <i>a surplus, an excess</i>, this could
only be due to an error or to some disorder in the society’s
economy” (l.c., p.  274).</p>
<p>Ganilh cites in evidence the following passage from
Quesnay:</p>
<p class="quote">“If the sterile class saves in order
to augment its cash … its labours and its gains will
diminish in the same proportion, and it will fall into
decay”(<i>Physiocratie</i>, p. 321).</p>
<p>The ass!  He does not understand Quesnay.</p>
<p>Monsieur Ganilh puts on the keystone in the following
paragraph:</p>
<p class="quote">“The larger they” (wages)
“are, the less is the revenue of the society”
(society stands on them, but they do not stand in society),
“and all the skill of governments should be applied to
reducing the amount [of the wages]…  <i>A
task</i> …<i>worthy of the enlightened century in
which we live</i>” (t. II, p. 24).</p>
<p>Then there are still <i>Lauderdale</i> (Brougham’s
insipit jests are not worth examining after him),
(Ferrier?), <i>Tocqueville, Storch, Senior</i>, and
<i>Rossi</i> to be considered briefly on productive and
unproductive labour.</p>
<p><a id="s10"> </a></p>
<h3>[10.]  Exchange of Revenue and Capital [Replacement of the
Total Amount of the Annual Product: (a) Exchange of Revenue
for Revenue; (b) Exchange of Revenue for Capital; (c)
Exchange of Capital for Capital]</h3>
<p><a id="vol31-p130"> </a></p>
<p>{To be distinguished: 1.  The part of the <i>revenue
which is trans-formed into new capital;</i> that is, the
part of the profit which is itself again capitalised. 
Here we leave this entirely out of account—it belongs
to the section on accumulation.  2. The revenue which
is exchanged with capital consumed in production, so that by
means of this exchange not new capital is formed, but old
capital replaced—in a word, the old capital is
conserved.  In this inquiry, therefore, we can put the
part of the revenue which is transformed into new capital as
equal to nil, and treat the subject as if all revenue covers
either revenue or capital consumed.</p>
<p>The whole amount of the annual product is therefore
divided into two parts: one part is consumed as revenue, the
other part replaces in kind the constant capital
consumed.</p>
<p>Revenue is exchanged for revenue, when for example the
producers of linen exchange a portion of that part of their
product—the linen—which represents their profits
and wages, their revenue, for corn that represents a portion
of the profits and <span class="context">||380|</span> wages
of farmers.  Here therefore there is the exchange of
linen for corn, those two commodities which both enter into
individual consumption—exchange of revenue in the form
of linen for revenue in the form of corn.  There is
absolutely no difficulty in this.  If consumable
products are produced in proportions corresponding to needs,
which means also that the proportionate amounts of social
labour required for their production are proportionately
distributed &lt;which of course is never exactly the case,
there being constant deviations, disproportions, which as
such are adjusted; but in such a way that the continuous
movement towards adjustment itself presupposes continuous
disproportion&gt;, then revenue, for example in the form of
linen, exists in the exact quantity in which it is required
as an article of consumption, therefore in which it is
replaced by the articles of consumption of other
producers.  What the producer of linen consumes in
corn, etc., the farmers and others consume in linen. 
The part of his product which represents revenue, which he
exchanges for other commodities (articles of consumption),
is thus taken in exchange as an article of consumption by
the producers of these other commodities.  What he
consumes in the product of others, these others consume in
his product.</p>
<p>It may be noted in passing: that no more necessary
labour-time is employed on a product than is required by
society—that is to say, no more time than on the
average is required for the production of this
commodity—is the result of capitalist production,
which even continuously reduces the minimum of necessary
labour-time.  But in order to do so, it must constantly
produce on a rising scale.</p>
<p>If 1 yard of linen costs only 1 hour and this is the
necessary labour-time that society has to use to satisfy its
need for 1 yard of linen, it by no means follows from this
that if 12 million yards are produced—that is, 12
million hours’ labour, or what is the same thing, 1 million
days’ labour—1 million labourers being employed as
linen weavers, society [needs] to employ such a part of its
labour-time “necessarily” on the weaving of
linen.  If the necessary labour-time is given, and
therefore also that a certain quantity of linen can be
produced in one day, the question arises how many such days
are to be used in the production of linen?  The
labour-time used on the total of particular products, in a
year for example, is equal to a definite quantity of this
use-value—for example, 1 yard of linen (say equivalent
to 1 day’s labour)—multiplied by the number of days’
labour used in all.  The total quantity of labour-time
used in a particular branch of production may be under or
over the correct proportion to the total available social
labour, although each aliquot part of the product contains
only the labour-time necessary for its production, or
although each aliquot part of the labour-time used was
necessary to make the corresponding aliquot part of the
total product.</p>
<p>From this standpoint, the necessary labour-time acquires
another meaning.  The question is, in what quantities
the necessary labour-time itself is distributed among the
various spheres of production.  Competition constantly
regulates this distribution, just as it equally constantly
disorganises it.  If too large a quantity of social
labour-time is used in one branch, the equivalent can be
paid only, as if the correct quantity had been used. 
The total product—that is to say, the value of the
total product—is in this case therefore not equal to
the labour-time contained in it, but is equal to the
proportionate labour-time which would have been used had the
total product been in proportion to production in the other
spheres.  But in as much as the price of the total
product falls below its value, the price of each aliquot
part of it falls.  If 6,000 yards of linen instead of
4,000 are produced, and if the value of the 6,000 yards is
12,000 shillings, they are sold for 8,000.  The price
of each yard is 1 <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> shillings
instead of 2—one-third below its value.  It
therefore amounts to the same thing as if
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> too much labour-time had been used
to produce one yard.  Assuming that the commodity has
use-value, the fall of its price below its value therefore
shows that, although each part of the product has cost only
the socially necessary labour-time &lt;here it is assumed
that the conditions of production remain unchanged&gt;, a
superfluous—more than necessary —total quantity
of social labour has been employed in this one branch.</p>
<p>The sinking of the relative value of the commodity as a
result of altered conditions of production is something
entirely different; <span class="context">||381|</span> this
piece of linen on the market has cost 2s., equal for example
to 1 day’s labour.  But it can be reproduced every day
for 1s.  Since the value is determined by the socially
necessary labour-time, not by the labour-time used by the
individual producer, the day that the producer has used for
the production of the one yard is now only equal to half the
socially determined day.  The fall of the price of his
yard from 2s. to 1s.—that is, of its price below the
value it has <i>cost</i> him—shows merely a change in
the conditions of production, that is, a change in the
necessary labour-time itself.  On the other hand, if
the production costs of the linen remain the same while
those of all other articles rise—with the exception of
gold, the material of money; or even [if the rise applies
to] certain articles such as wheat, copper, etc., in a word,
to articles which do not enter into the component parts of
the linen—then one yard of linen would be equal to
2s. as before.  Its <i>price</i> would not fall, but
its relative value expressed in wheat, copper, etc., would
have fallen.</p>
<p>----------------</p>
<p>Of the part of the revenue in one branch of production
(which produces consumable commodities) which is consumed in
the revenue of another branch of production, it can be said
that the demand is equal to its own supply (in so far as
production is kept in the right <i>proportion</i>).  It
is the same as if each branch itself consumed that part of
its revenue.  Here there is only a formal metamorphosis
of the commodity: C—M—C’.  Linen—
money—wheat.</p>
<p>Both commodities which are exchanged here represent only
a part of the new labour added in the year.  But in the
first place it is clear that this exchange—in which
two producers mutually consume a part of their product which
represents revenue in each other’s commodities—only
takes place in those branches of production which produce
consumable articles, articles which enter directly into
individual consumption, in which consequently revenue can be
spent as revenue.  Secondly, it is just as clear: that
only regarding <i>this part</i> of the exchange of products
it is true that the producer’s supply is equal to the demand
for other products which he wishes to consume.  Here in
fact it is only a question of a simple exchange of
commodities.  Instead of producing his means of
subsistence himself, he produces the means of subsistence
for another, who produces his.  No relation between
revenue and capital enters into this.  Revenue in one
form of consumable articles is exchanged against revenue in
another form of consumable articles, and so in fact
consumable articles are exchanged for consumable
articles.  What determines their process of exchange is
not that both are revenue, but that both are consumable
articles.  Their definite form as revenue does not
enter into it at all.  It shows itself however in the
use-value of the interchangeable commodities, in that both
enter into individual consumption; which in turn however
means no more than that one part of consumable products is
exchanged for another part of consumable products.</p>
<p>The form of revenue can only intervene or make itself
manifest where the form of capital confronts it.  But
even in this case what Say and other vulgar economists
assert is not true— that if A cannot sell his linen or
can only sell it under its price—that is, the part of
his linen which he wishes to consume himself as
revenue—then this happens because B, C, etc., have
produced too little wheat, meat, etc.  It may be
because they have not produced enough of these.  But it
may also be because A has produced too much linen.  For
assuming that B, C, etc., have enough wheat, etc., to buy
all A’s linen, they nevertheless do not buy it, because only
a definite quantity of linen is <i>consumed</i> by them, Or
it may also be because A has produced more linen than the
part of their revenue which can be spent on clothing
materials altogether—that is, absolutely, because each
person can expend as revenue only a definite quantity of his
own product, and A’s production of linen presupposes a
greater amount of revenue than in total there is.  It
is ridiculous, however, when it is only a matter of the
exchange of revenue against revenue, to suppose that what is
wanted is not the use-value of the product but the quantity
of this use-value, thus once again forgetting that
<i>this</i> exchange concerns only the satisfaction of
needs, not, as in exchange-value, the quantity.</p>
<p>But everyone will prefer to have a large rather than a
small quantity of an article.  If this is supposed to
solve the difficulty, then <span class="context">||382|</span> it is absolutely impossible to
understand why the producer of linen, instead of exchanging
his linen for other articles of consumption and piling these
up <i>en masse</i>, does not carry out the simpler process
of enjoying a part of his revenue in his superfluous
linen.  Why does he at all transform his revenue from
the form of linen into other forms?  Because he has to
satisfy other needs than the need for linen.  Why does
he himself consume only a certain part of the linen? 
Because only a quantitatively determined part of the linen
has use-value for him.  The same thing, however, holds
for B, C, etc.  If B sells wine and C books and D
mirrors, each may prefer to consume the surplus of his
revenue in his own product—wine, books,
mirrors—rather than in linen.  Thus it cannot be
said that, necessarily, too little wine, books and mirrors
have been produced because A cannot transform his revenue in
the form of linen (or cannot transform it at its value) into
wine, books and mirrors.  It is still more ridiculous,
however, when this exchange of revenue against
revenue—this one section of the exchange of
commodities—is passed off as the whole of commodity
exchange.</p>
<p>We have thus disposed of one part of the product.  A
part of the consumable products changes hands between the
producers of these consumable products themselves. 
Each consumes a part of his revenue (profit and wages) in
the other’s consumable product instead of in his own
consumable product, and in fact he can only do this in so
far as there is the reciprocal consumption by the other of
someone else’s consumable product instead of his own. 
It is the same as if each had consumed that part of his
consumable product which represents his own revenue.</p>
<p>For all the rest of the products, however, complicated
relations intervene, and it is only here that the
commodities exchanged confront each other as revenue and
capital, and not only as revenue.</p>
<p>First a distinction has to be made.  In all branches
of production a part of the total product represents
revenue, labour added (during the year), profit and
wages.  &lt;Rent, interest, etc., are parts of profit;
the income of the State good-for-nothings is part of profit
and wages; the income of other unproductive labourers is the
part of profit and wages which they buy with their
unproductive labours—it therefore does not increase
the product existing as profit and wages, but only
determines how much of it they consume, and how much is
consumed by the labourers and capitalists themselves.&gt;
But only in one section of the spheres of production can the
part of the product representing revenue enter directly in
kind into the revenue, or in its <i>use-value</i> be
consumed as revenue.  All products which are
<i>only</i> means of production cannot be consumed in kind,
in their immediate form, as revenue, but only their
<i>value</i>.  This however must be consumed in the
branches of production which produce directly consumable
articles.  A part of the means of production may be
immediate articles of consumption—it may be one or the
other according to the use made of it, as for example a
horse, a cart, etc.  A part of the immediate articles
of consumption may be means of production, like corn for
spirits, wheat for seed, and so on.  Almost all
articles of consumption can re-enter the production process
as excrements of consumption, as for example worn-out and
half-rotten rags of linen in the manufacture of paper. 
But no one produces linen in order that it should become, as
rags, the raw material for paper.  It only gets this
form after the linen weaver’s product as such has entered
consumption.  Only as excrement of this consumption, as
residuum and product of the consumption process, can it then
go into a new production sphere as means of
production.  This case, therefore, is not relevant
here.</p>
<p>The products therefore—of which the aliquot part
that represents revenue can be consumed by their own
producers as value, but not as use-value (so that they must
sell the part for example of their machines which represents
wages and profit in order to consume it, [as they] cannot
directly satisfy any individual need with it as a
machine)— [these products] can just as little be
consumed by the producers of other products; they cannot
enter into their individual consumption, and hence cannot
form part of the products on which they spend their revenue,
since this would be in contradiction to the use-value of
these commodities: their use-value by the nature of the case
<i>excludes</i> individual consumption.  The producers
of these unconsumable products, therefore, can only consume
their <i>exchange-value</i>; that is to say, they must first
transform them into money in order to retransform this money
into consumable commodities.  But to whom are they to
sell <span class="context">||383|</span> them?  To
producers of other individually unconsumable products? 
Then they would merely have one unconsumable product in the
place of the other.  It is however presupposed that
this part of the product forms their revenue; that they sell
these commodities in order to consume their value in
consumable products.  For that reason they can only
sell them to the producers of products that can be consumed
individually.</p>
<p>This part of the exchange of commodities represents
exchange of one man’s capital for another man’s revenue, and
of one man’s revenue for another man’s capital.  Only
one part of the total product of the producer of consumable
products represents revenue; the other part represents
constant capital.  He can neither himself consume the
latter, nor can he exchange it for the consumable products
made by others.  He can neither consume in kind the
use-value of this part of the product, nor can he consume
its value by exchanging it for other consumable
products.  He must on the contrary transform it again
into the natural elements of his constant capital.  He
must <i>consume industrially</i> this part of his product,
that is, use it as means of production.</p>
<p>But in its use-value his product is only capable of
entering individual consumption; he cannot therefore
transform it again in kind into his own elements of
production.  Its use-value excludes <i>industrial
consumption</i>.  So he can only industrially consume
its value, [by selling it] to the producers of those
elements of production needed for his product.  He can
neither consume in kind this part of his product, nor can he
consume its value by selling it for other products that can
be consumed individually.  Just as little as this part
of his product can enter into his own revenue, can it be
replaced out of the revenue of producers of other
individually consumable products; since this would only be
possible if he exchanged his product for their product and
so consumed the value of his product, which cannot
happen.  But since this part of his product, as well as
the other part which he can consume as revenue, by its
use-value can only be consumed as revenue, must enter into
individual consumption and cannot replace constant capital,
it must enter into the revenue of the producers of
unconsumable products —it must be exchanged against
that part of their products whose value they can consume, or
in other words which represents their revenue.</p>
<p>If we look at this exchange from the standpoint of each
of the people exchanging, for A, the producer of the
consumable product, it represents a transformation of
capital into capital.  He transforms the part of his
total product which is equal to the value of the constant
capital it contains back again into the natural form in
which it can function as constant capital.  Both before
and after the exchange it represents, in its value, only
constant capital.  For B, the producer of the product
that cannot be consumed, it is the reverse: the exchange
represents merely the transformation of revenue from one
form into another.  He transforms the part of his total
product which forms his revenue—equal to the part of
the total product which represents labour newly added, his
own labour (capital and labourer)—into the natural
form in which only he can consume it as revenue.  Both
before and after the exchange it represents, in its value,
only his revenue.</p>
<p>If we look at the relation from both sides there, A
exchanges his constant capital for B’s revenue, and B
exchanges his revenue for A’s constant capital.  B’s
revenue replaces A’s constant capital, and A’s constant
capital replaces B’s revenue.</p>
<p>In the exchange itself &lt;irrespective of the purposes
of those carrying it out&gt; only commodities confront each
other—and a simple exchange of commodities takes
place—the relation between which is merely that of
commodities, the designations of revenue and capital having
no significance here.  Only the different
<i>use-value</i> of these commodities shows that one lot can
only serve for industrial consumption, and the other only
for individual consumption, can only enter into this
consumption.  The various practical uses of the various
use-values of various commodities, however, concern their
consumption and do not affect the process of their exchange
as commodities.  It is quite a different thing when the
capitalist’s capital is transformed into wages, and labour
is transformed into capital.  Here the commodities do
not confront each other as simple commodities, but capital
as capital.  In the exchange we have just been
considering sellers and buyers face each other only as
sellers and buyers, only as simple commodity owners.</p>
<p>It is further clear that the whole of the product
destined for individual consumption or the whole product
entering into individual consumption, in so far as it enters
into it, can only be exchanged for revenue.  The fact
that it cannot be industrially consumed means precisely that
it can only be consumed as revenue, i.e., only
individually.  &lt;As noted above, we here abstract
from the transformation of profit into capital.&gt;</p>
<p>If A is a producer of a product that can only be
individually consumed, let his revenue be equal to one-third
of his total product, his constant capital to
two-thirds.  The assumption implies that he himself
consumes the first one-third, whether he <span class="context">||384|</span> consumes it all himself in
kind or only partly or not at all, or whether he consumes
its value in other articles of consumption; the sellers of
these articles of consumption then consume their own revenue
in A’s product.  So the part of the consumable product
which represents the revenue of the producers of consumable
products is consumed by them either directly, or indirectly,
through exchanging among themselves the products to be
consumed by them; in regard to this part, therefore, where
<i>revenue is exchanged for revenue—here</i> it is the
same as if A represented the producers of all consumable
products.  He himself consumes one-third of this
aggregate amount, the aliquot part which represents his
revenue.  This part, however, represents exactly the
quantity of labour which during the year category A has
added to its constant capital, and this quantity is equal to
the total sum of wages and profits produced by category A
during the year.</p>
<p>The other two-thirds of category A’s total product are
equal value of the constant capital, and must therefore be
replaced by the product of the annual labour of category B,
which produces products that cannot be [individually]
consumed and only enter into industrial consumption as means
of production in the production process.  But as this
two-thirds of A’s total product, just the same as the first
one-third, must enter into individual consumption, it is
taken by the producers of category B, in exchange for the
part of their product which represents their revenue. 
Category A has therefore exchanged the constant part of its
total product for constant capital in its original natural
form, retransforming it into the newly-produced products of
category B; but category B has only paid for it with that
part of its product which represents its revenue but which
it can only consume in the products of A.  It has thus
in fact paid with its newly-added labour, which is
completely represented by the part of B’s product that is
exchanged for the last two-thirds of A’s product.  Thus
A’s total product is exchanged for revenue, or passes
entirely into individual consumption.  On the other
hand (on the assumption that the transformation of revenue
into capital is here left out of account, being taken as
equal to nil) the <i>total revenue</i> of society is
expended on product A; for the producers of A consume their
revenue in A, and so do the producers of category B. 
And there is no other category besides these two.</p>
<p>The total product A is consumed, although it contains
two-thirds constant capital, which cannot be consumed by the
producers of A but must be retransformed into the natural
form of their elements of production.  The total
product A is equal to the total revenue of society. 
The total revenue of society, however, represents the total
labour-time which it has added during the year to the
existing constant capital.  Now although the total
product A consists of newly-added labour only as to
one-third, and as to two-thirds of past labour that has to
be replaced, it can be bought in its entirety by newly-added
labour, because two-thirds of this total annual labour must
be consumed not in their own products but in the products of
A.  A is replaced by two-thirds more newly-added labour
than it itself contains, because these two-thirds are labour
newly added in B, and B can only consume it individually in
A, just as A can only consume the two-thirds industrially in
B.  Thus the total product of A can in the first place
be entirely consumed as revenue, and at the same time its
constant capital can be replaced.  Or rather it can
only be entirely consumed as revenue because two-thirds of
it are replaced by the producers of constant capital, who
cannot consume in kind the part of their product
representing revenue, but are obliged to consume it in A,
that is, through exchanging it for two-thirds of A.</p>
<p>We have thus disposed of the final two-thirds of A.</p>
<p>It is clear that it makes no difference if a third
category C exists, whose products are consumable both
industrially and individually; for example, corn, by men or
by cattle or as seed or as bread; vehicles, horses, cattle,
etc.  In so far as these products enter into individual
consumption they must be consumed as revenue, direct or
indirect, by their own producers, or by the producers
(direct or indirect) of the part of the constant capital
contained in them.  They therefore come under A. 
In so far as they do not enter into individual consumption,
they come under B.</p>
<p>The process of this second kind of exchange, where it is
not revenue that is exchanged against revenue but capital
against revenue —in which the whole constant capital
must in the end be resolved into revenue, that is, into
newly-added labour —can be thought of in two
ways.  Let A’s product be for example linen.  The
two-thirds of the linen which are equal to the constant
capital of A (or its value) pay for yarn, machinery and
auxiliary materials.  But the yarn manufacturer and the
manufacturer of machinery <span class="context">||385|</span> can only consume as much of
this product as represents their own revenue.  The
linen manufacturer pays the whole price of the yarn and
machinery with these two-thirds of his product.  By so
doing he has thus replaced for the spinner and the machinery
manufacturer their total product which entered into the
linen as constant capital.  But this total product is
itself equal to the constant capital and revenue—one
part being equal to the labour added by the spinner and
machinery manufacturer, and another part representing the
value of their own means of production, that is, for the
spinner flax, oil, machinery, coal, etc., and for the
machinery manufacturer coal, iron, machinery, etc.  A’s
constant capital, equal to two-thirds, has thus replaced the
total product of the spinner and machinery manufacturer,
their constant capital plus the labour newly added by
them—their capital plus their revenue.  But they
can only consume their revenue in A.  After deducting
the part of the two-thirds of A which is equal to their
revenue, with the rest they pay for their raw materials and
machinery.  According to our assumption, however, the
latter need not replace any constant capital.  Only so
much of their product can enter into product A—and
therefore also into the products which are means of
production for A—as A can pay for.  But A can
only pay with his two-thirds for as much as B can buy with
his revenue, that is to say, as much as the product
exchanged by B contains revenue, newly-added labour. 
If the producers of the final elements of production of A
had to sell to the spinner a quantity of their product which
represented a part of their own constant capital— that
is, which represented more than the labour they had added to
their constant capital—then they could not accept
payment in A, because they cannot consume one part of this
product.  Consequently what takes place is the
opposite.</p>
<p>Let us trace the stages in reverse.  Let us assume
that the total linen is equal to 12 days.  The product
of the flax-grower, of the iron manufacturer, etc., is equal
to 4 days; this product is sold to the spinner and the
machinery manufacturer, who in turn add 4 days to it; these
sell it to the weaver, who again adds 4 days.  The
linen weaver can thus himself consume one-third of his
product; 3 days replace his constant capital for him and pay
for the product of the spinner and machinery manufacturer;
these can consume 4 of the 8 days, and with the other 4 they
pay the flax-grower, etc., and thus replace their constant
capital; the last-named have only their labour to replace
with the last 4 days in linen.</p>
<p>The revenue, although it is assumed to be of the same
size— equal to 4 days—in all three cases, is of
different proportions in the products of the three classes
of producers who participate in producing product A. 
For the linen weaver, it is one-third of his product, equal
to one-third of 12; for the spinner and for the machinery
manufacturer it is equal to one-half of his product, equal
to one-half of 8; for the flax-grower it is equal to his
product, 4.  In relation to the total product it is
however exactly the same, equal to one-third of 12, that
is, 4.  But for the weaver, the labour newly added by
spinner, machinery manufacturer and flax-grower takes the
form of constant capital.  For the spinner and
machinery manufacturer, the total product represents the
labour newly added by themselves and by the flax-grower, the
labour-time of the flax-grower appearing as constant
capital.  For the flax-grower, this phenomenon of
constant capital has ceased to exist.  Because of this,
the spinner for example can use machinery, or constant
capital in general, in the same proportions as the
weaver.  For example, <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> :
<sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>.  But in the first place the
amount (the total amount) of the capital employed in
spinning must be smaller than that used in weaving, since
its total product enters as constant capital into
weaving.  Secondly, if the spinner also has the
proportion of <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> :
<sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>, his constant capital would be
equal to <sup class="ratio">16</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> his labour added to
<sup class="ratio">8</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>; the former equal to 5
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> days’ labour, the latter to 2
<sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>.  In this case there would be
proportionately more days’ labour contained in the branch
which supplies him with flax, etc.  He would then have
to pay 5 <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> for newly-added labour,
instead of 4 days.</p>
<p>It is self-evident that only that part of category A’s
constant capital has to be replaced by new labour which
enters into the process of giving value to A, that is, is
consumed by A during the labour-process.  The whole of
the raw material and the auxiliary materials enter into it,
and the wear and tear of the fixed capital.  The other
part of the fixed capital does not enter into it, and
therefore has not got to be replaced.</p>
<p>A large part of the existing constant capital—large
as regards the relation of the fixed capital to the total
capital—does not therefore require to be replaced
annually by new labour.  For that reason the (absolute)
amount [of the capital to be annually replaced] may be
considerable, but nevertheless it is not large in relation
to the total (annual) product.  This <i>entire part of
the constant capital</i>, in A and B, which enters into the
determination of the rate of profit (with a given
surplus-value), does not enter as a determining element into
the current reproduction of the fixed capital.  The
larger this part in relation to the total capital—the
greater the scale on which present, already existing, fixed
capital is employed in production—the greater the
<i>current volume of reproduction</i> will be that is used
for the replacement of the worn-out fixed capital, but the
smaller relatively will be the <i>proportional</i> amount,
in relation to the total capital,</p>
<p>Let the reproduction period (<i>the average</i>) for all
kinds of fixed capital be ten years.  <span class="context">||386|</span> Let us assume that the
different kinds of fixed capital have a turnover of 20, 17,
15, 12, 11, 10, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, <sup class="ratio">4</sup>/<sub class="ratio">6</sub>
and <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">6</sub> years (14 kinds), so that the
fixed capital has an <i>average</i> turnover of 10
years.</p>
<p>On the average, therefore, the capital would have to be
replaced in 10 years.  If the total fixed capital
amounted to <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">10</sub> of the total capital,
then <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">10</sub> of this would mean that only
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">100</sub> of the total capital would have
to be replaced annually.</p>
<p>If it amounted to <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>, then
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">30</sub> of the total capital would have
to be replaced annually.</p>
<p>But let us now compare fixed capitals with different
reproduction periods—the capital with a 20-year
period, for example, in contrast to the capital with a
period of <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> of a year.</p>
<p>Only <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">20</sub> of the fixed capital
which is reproduced in 20 years has to be replaced
annually.  So that if it amounts to
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">2</sub> of the total capital, only
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">40</sub> of the total capital has to be
replaced annually, and if it amounts even to
<sup class="ratio">4</sup>/<sub class="ratio">5</sub> of the total capital, only
<sup class="ratio">4</sup>/<sub class="ratio">100</sub>=<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">25</sub> of
the total capital has to be replaced annually.  On the
other hand, if the capital which has a reproduction period
of <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">6</sub> of a year—that is, turns
over three times a year—amounts to only
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">10</sub> of the capital, then the fixed
capital has to be replaced three times a year, so that
<sup class="ratio">3</sup>/<sub class="ratio">10</sub> of the capital has to be replaced
annually, nearly one-third of the total capital.  On
the average, the larger the fixed capital in proportion to
the total capital, the longer is its <i>relative</i> (not
absolute) period of reproduction; and the smaller it is, the
shorter its <i>relative</i> period of reproduction. 
Implements form a much smaller part of handicraft capital
than machinery does of machine-production capital.  But
handicraft implements wear out much more quickly than
machinery.</p>
<p>Although the absolute magnitude of its
reproduction—or its wear and tear—grows with the
absolute size of the fixed capital, as a rule its
proportional magnitude falls, in so far as its period of
turnover, its duration, as a rule increases in proportion to
its size.  This proves among other things that the
quantity of labour reproducing machinery or fixed capital is
not at all proportional to the labour which originally
produced these machines (conditions of production remaining
the same), since only the annual wear and tear has to be
replaced.  If the productivity of labour rises—as
it constantly does in this branch of production—the
quantity of labour required for the reproduction of this
part of the constant capital diminishes still more. 
However, account has to be taken of the means of consumption
daily used by the machine (which however have nothing
directly to do with the labour employed in the
machine-building industry itself).  But machinery,
which needs merely coal and a little oil or tallow, lives on
an infinitely stricter diet than the labourer—not only
the labourer whom it replaces, but the labourer who built
the machine itself.</p>
<p>----------------</p>
<p>We have now disposed of the product of the entire
category A and of a part of category B’s product.  A is
completely consumed: one-third by its own producers,
two-thirds by the producers of B, who cannot consume their
own revenue in their own product.  The two-thirds of A,
in which they consume the part of the value of their product
which represents revenue, at the same time replace their
constant capital in kind for the producers of A, that is,
provide them with the commodities which they <i>consume
industrially</i>.  But with the consumption of A’s
entire product, and with two-thirds of it replaced by B in
the form of constant capital, we have also disposed of the
<i>entire</i> part of the product which represents the
labour newly added annually.  This labour cannot
therefore buy any other part of the total product.  In
fact, the whole of the labour added annually (leaving out of
account the capitalisation of profit) is equal to the
<i>labour contained in A</i>.  For one-third of A which
is consumed by its own producers represents the labour newly
added by them during the year to the two-thirds of A which
represent A’s constant capital.  They have performed no
labour apart from this, which they consume in their own
product.  And the other two-thirds of A, which are
replaced by B’s product and consumed by the producers of B,
represent all the labour-time which the producers of B have
added to their own constant capital.  They have added
no more in labour, and there is nothing more for them to
<span class="context">||387|</span> consume.</p>
<p>In its <i>use-value</i>, product A represents the whole
part of the annual total product which enters annually into
individual consumption.  In its <i>exchange-value</i>,
it represents the total quantity of labour newly added by
the producers during the year.</p>
<p>Thus, however, we have as <i>residuum</i> a third part of
the total product whose constituent parts, when exchanged,
can represent neither the exchange of revenue against
revenue nor of capital against revenue and vice versa. 
This is the part of product B which represents B’s constant
capital.  This part is not included in B’s revenue and
therefore cannot be replaced by or exchanged against product
A, and therefore also cannot enter as a constituent part
into A’s constant capital.  This part is likewise
consumed, industrially consumed, to the extent that it
enters not only into B’s labour-process but also into the
formation of value in B.  This part, therefore, like
all other parts of the total product, must be replaced <i>in
the proportion in which it forms a component part of the
total product</i>, and indeed it must be replaced in kind by
<i>new</i> products of the same sort.  On the other
hand, it is not replaced by any new labour.  For the
total quantity of newly-added labour is equal to the
labour-time contained in A, which is completely replaced
only by B consuming his revenue in two-thirds of A and
supplying to A in exchange all the means of production which
are consumed in A and must be replaced.  For the first
one-third of A, which is consumed by its own producers,
consists only—as exchange-value—of the labour
newly added by themselves, and it contains no constant
capital.</p>
<p>Let us now examine this residuum.</p>
<p>It consists of the constant capital which enters into raw
materials, and secondly of the constant capital which enters
into the formation of the capital, and thirdly of the
constant capital which enters into auxiliary materials.</p>
<p><i>First, the raw materials</i>.  Their constant
capital consists in the first place of fixed capital,
machinery, instruments of labour and buildings, and perhaps
auxiliary materials, which are means of consumption for the
machinery employed.  In regard to the directly
consumable part of the raw materials —such as cattle,
corn, grapes, and such like—this difficulty does not
arise.  In this aspect they belong to class A. 
This part of the constant capital contained in them enters
into the two-thirds of the constant part of A, which is
exchanged as capital against the unconsumable products of B
or in which B consumes his revenue.  This holds good
<i>too</i> in general for such raw materials that cannot be
immediately consumed as far as they enter in kind into the
consumable product itself, however many intermediate stages
they may pass through in the processes of production. 
The part of flax that is transformed into yarn and later
into linen enters in its entirety into the consumable
product.</p>
<p>But a part of these <i>vegetative raw materials</i>, such
as timber, flax, hemp, leather and so on, partly enters
directly into the components of the fixed capital itself,
and partly into the auxiliary materials for the fixed
capital.  For example, in the form of oil, tallow,
etc.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, however, <i>seed</i> [belongs to the
constant capital expended for the production of raw
materials].  Vegetative materials and animals reproduce
themselves.  Vegetation and generation.  By seed
we mean actual seed, and in addition fodder which reverts to
the land as dung, pedigree cattle, etc.  This large
part of the annual product—or of the constant part of
the annual product—itself serves directly as material
for regeneration, it reproduces itself.</p>
<p><i>Non-vegetative raw materials</i>.  Metals,
stones, etc.  Their value consists of only two parts,
since here there is no seed—which represents the raw
materials of agriculture.  Their value consists only of
added labour and machinery consumed (including the means of
consumption for the machinery).  In addition therefore
to the part of the product which represents newly-added
labour and is hence included in the exchange of B for the
two-thirds of A, there is nothing to be replaced but the
wear and tear of the fixed capital and its means of
consumption (such as coal, oil, etc.).  But these raw
materials form the principal component part of the constant
capital, of the fixed capital (machinery and instruments of
labour, buildings, etc.).  They therefore replace their
constant capital in kind by the exchange [of capital against
capital].</p>
<p><span class="context">||388|</span> <i>Secondly, the
fixed capital (machinery, buildings, instruments of labour,
containers of all kinds</i>).</p>
<p>Their constant capital consists of: (1) their raw
materials, metals, stones, vegetative raw materials such as
timber, leather belting, rope, etc.  But though these
raw materials form the raw material for them, they
themselves enter as instruments of labour into the
production of these raw materials.  Hence they replace
themselves in kind.  The iron producer has to replace
machinery, the machine builder iron.  In quarrying
there is wear and tear of machinery, but in factory
buildings there is wear and tear of building stone,
etc.  (2) <i>The wear and tear of
machine—building machinery</i>, which within a certain
period has to be replaced by a new product of the same
kind.  But the product of the same kind can, of course,
replace itself.  (3) <i>The means of consumption for
the machine</i> (auxiliary materials).  Machinery
consumes coal, but coal consumes machinery, and so on. 
In the form of containers, tubes, pipes, etc., machinery of
all kinds enters into the production of the means of
consumption for machinery, as in the case of tallow, soap,
gas (for lighting).  Therefore also in these cases the
products of these spheres enter reciprocally into each
other’s constant capital, and consequently replace each
other in kind.</p>
<p>If beasts of burden are included among machines, what has
to be replaced in their case is fodder and in certain
conditions stabling (buildings).  But if fodder enters
into the production of cattle, so do cattle into the
production of fodder.</p>
<p><i>In the third place, auxiliary materials</i>. 
Some of these require raw materials, like oil, soap, tallow,
gas, etc.  On the other hand, in the form of
fertilisers, etc., they in turn enter in part into the
production of these raw materials.  Coal is required
for making gas, but gas lighting is used in producing coal,
etc.  Other <i>auxiliary materials</i> consist only of
labour added and fixed capital (machinery, containers,
etc.).  Coal must replace the wear and tear of the
steam-engine used to produce it.  But the steam-engine
consumes coal.  Coal itself enters into the means of
production of coal.  Thus it replaces itself in
kind.  Transport by rail enters into the production
costs of coal, but coal in turn enters into the production
costs of the locomotive.</p>
<p><i>Later on, there is something special to be added about
chemical factories</i>, all of which in greater or smaller
degree produce auxiliary materials, such as the raw material
of containers (for example, glass, porcelain), as well as
articles which enter directly into consumption.</p>
<p>All colouring materials are auxiliary materials. 
But they enter into the product not only as to their value,
as for example coal consumed enters into cotton; but they
reproduce themselves in the form of the product (its
colours).</p>
<p><i>Auxiliary materials</i> are either <i>means of
consumption for machinery</i> —in this case either
fuel for the prime mover, or means of reducing the friction
of the operating machinery, such as tallow, soap, oil,
etc.—or they are auxiliary materials for buildings,
like cement, etc.  Or they are auxiliary materials for
carrying on the production process in general, such as
lighting, heating, etc.  (in this case they are
auxiliary materials required by the labourers themselves to
enable them to work).</p>
<p>Or <i>they are auxiliary materials</i> which enter into
the formation of the raw materials as do all types of
fertilisers and all chemical products consumed by the raw
materials.</p>
<p>Or <i>they are auxiliary materials</i> which enter into
the finished product—colouring matter, polishing
materials, and so on.</p>
<p>----------------</p>
<p><i>The result is therefore:</i></p>
<p>A replaces his own constant capital, [equal to]
two-thirds [of the product], by exchange with that part of
B’s unconsumable product which represents B ‘s
revenue—that is, the labour added in category B during
the year.  But A does not replace B’s constant
capital.  B for his part must replace this constant
capital in kind by new products of the same sort.  But
B has no labour-time over to replace them with.  For
all the new labour-time added by him forms his revenue, and
is therefore represented by the part of B’s product which
enters as constant capital into A.  How then is B’s
constant capital replaced?</p>
<p>Partly by his <i>own reproduction</i> (vegetative or
animal), as in all agriculture and stock-raising; partly by
<i>exchange in kind</i> of parts of one constant capital for
parts of another constant capital, because the product of
one sphere enters as raw material or means of production
into the other sphere, and vice versa; that is, because the
products of the various spheres of production, the <span class="context">||389|</span> various sorts of constant
capital, enter reciprocally in kind into each other’s sphere
as conditions of production.</p>
<p>The producers of unconsumable products are the producers
of constant capital for the producers of consumable
products.  But at the same time their products serve
them reciprocally as elements or factors of their own
constant capital.  That is to say, they consume each
other’s products <i>industrially</i>.</p>
<p>The whole product A is consumed.  Therefore also the
whole of the constant capital it contains.  The
producers of A consume one-third of A, the producers of the
unconsumable products B consume two-thirds of A.  A’s
constant capital is replaced by the products of B which form
B’s revenue.  This is in fact the only part of the
constant capital that is replaced by <i>newly-added
labour;</i> and it is replaced by it because the quantity of
products B that is the newly-added labour in B, is not
consumed by B, but on the contrary is industrially consumed
by A, while B consumes individually the two-thirds of A.</p>
<p>Let A be equal to 3 days’ labour; his constant capital,
on our assumption, is equal to 2 days’ labour.  B
replaces the product of two-thirds of A, and so supplies
unconsumable products equal to 2 days’ labour.  Now 3
days’ labour have been consumed, and 2 are left.  In
other words, the 2 days of past labour in A are replaced by
2 days of newly-added labour in B, but only because the 2
days of newly-added labour in B consume their value in A and
not in product B itself.</p>
<p>B’s constant capital, in so far as it has entered into
the total product B, must likewise be replaced <i>in
kind</i> by new products of the same sort—that is, by
products which are required for <i>industrial</i>
consumption by B.  But it is not replaced by <i>new</i>
labour-time, although it is replaced by the <i>products</i>
of the labour-time newly applied during the year.</p>
<p>Let the whole constant capital in B’s total product be
two-thirds.  Then if the newly-added labour (equal to
the total wages and profit) is 1, the past labour which
served it as material and means of labour is equal to
2.  How then are these 2 replaced?  The proportion
of constant and variable capital may vary considerably
within the various spheres of production of B.  But on
our assumption the average is as <sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> :
<sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub>, or 1 : 2.  Each of the
producers of B is now Laced by two-thirds of his product,
such as coal, iron, flax, machinery, cattle, wheat (i.e.,
the part of his cattle and wheat that does not enter into
consumption), etc.; whose elements of production must be
replaced, or which must be reconverted into the natural form
of their elements of production.  But all these
products themselves re-enter industrial consumption. 
The wheat (as seed) is in turn also its own raw material,
and a part of the cattle produced replaces what has been
consumed, that is, itself.  In these spheres of
production of B (agriculture and stock-raising) this part of
their product therefore replaces their own constant capital
in its natural form.  A part of this product,
therefore, does not go into circulation (at least need not
go into circulation, and can only do so in a formal
sense).  Others of these products, such as flax, hemp,
etc., coal, iron, timber, machinery, in part enter into
their own production as means of production, in the same way
as seed in agriculture: for example, coal in the production
of coal, and machinery in the production of machinery. 
A part of the product consisting of machinery and coal, and
in fact a part of that part of this product which represents
its constant capital, thus replaces itself and merely
changes its place in the process of production.  It
changes from a product into its own means of production.</p>
<p>Another part of these and of other products reciprocally
enter into each other as elements of
production—machinery into iron and timber, timber and
iron into machinery, oil into machinery and machinery into
oil, coal into iron, iron (tram-rails, etc.) into coal, and
so on.  In so far as the two-thirds of these products
of B are not self-replacing in this way—that is, do
not come back in their natural form into their own
productions so that a part of B is directly consumed
industrially by its own producers, just as a part of A is
directly consumed individually by its own
producers—the products of the producers of B replace
each other reciprocally as means of production.  The
product of a goes into b’s industrial consumption and the
product of b into a’s industrial consumption; or in a
roundabout way, a’s product into b’s industrial consumption,
b’s product into that of c, and that of c into that of
a.  What therefore is consumed as constant capital in
one of B’s spheres of production is newly produced in
another; but what is consumed in the latter is produced in
the former.  What in one sphere passes from the form of
machinery and coal into the form of iron, passes in the
other from the form of iron and coal into machinery, and so
on.</p>
<p><span class="context">||390|</span> What has to be done
is to replace B’s constant capital in its natural
form.  If we consider B’s total product, it represents
the entire constant capital in all its natural forms. 
And where the product of one particular sphere of B cannot
replace its own constant capital in kind, purchase and sale,
a change of hands, puts everything here in its proper place
again.</p>
<p>Here, therefore, there is replacement of constant capital
by constant capital; in so far as this does not occur
directly and without exchange, here therefore there is
<i>exchange of capital for capital</i>, that is, of products
for products on the basis of their use-value; the products
enter reciprocally into their respective production
processes, so that each of them is industrially consumed by
the producers of the other.</p>
<p>This part of the capital consists neither of profit nor
of wages.  It contains no newly-added labour.  It
is not exchanged against revenue.  It is neither
directly nor indirectly paid for by consumers.  It
makes no difference whether this reciprocal replacement of
capitals is carried through with the aid of merchants (that
is, by merchant’s capitals) or not.</p>
<p>But since these products are new (machinery, iron, coal,
timber, etc., which reciprocally replace each other), since
they are the products of the last year’s labour—thus
the wheat which serves as seed is just as much a product of
new labour as the wheat which passes into consumption,
etc.—how can it be said that no newly-added labour is
contained in these products?  And moreover isn’t their
form striking evidence to the contrary?  Even if not in
the case of wheat or cattle, surely in the case of a machine
its form bears witness to the labour which has transformed
it from iron, etc., into a machine, and so forth.</p>
<p>This problem has been solved earlier, It is not necessary
to go into it here again.</p>
<p>&lt;Adam Smith’s statement that the trade between dealers
and dealers must be equal to the trade between dealers and
consumers (by which he means direct, not industrial,
consumers, since he himself includes industrial consumers
among dealers) is therefore wrong.  It is based on his
false assertion that the whole product consists of revenue,
and in fact only means that the part of the exchange of
commodities which is equal to the exchange between capital
and revenue is equal to the total exchange of
commodities.  As the assertion is wrong, the practical
applications Tooke made of it for the circulation of money
are also wrong (especially the relation between the quantity
of money circulating between dealers and the quantity of
money circulating between dealers and consumers).</p>
<p>Let us take as the final dealer confronting the consumer
the merchant who buys the product of A; this product is
bought from him by the revenue of A, equal to one-third of
A, and by the revenue of B, equal to two-thirds of A. 
These replace his merchant’s capital for him.  The
total of their revenues must cover his capital.  (The
profit which the rascal makes must be accounted for by his
retaining a part of A for himself, and selling a smaller
part of A for the value of A.  Whether the rascal is
thought of as a necessary agent of production or as a
sybaritic intermediary does not in any way alter the case.)
This exchange between dealer in A and consumer of A covers
in value the exchange between the dealer in A and all the
producers of A, and consequently all dealings between these
producers among themselves.</p>
<p>The merchant buys the linen.  This is the last
dealing between dealer and dealers.  The linen weaver
buys yarn, machinery, coal, etc.  This is the last but
one dealing between dealer and dealers.  The spinner
buys flax, machinery, coal, etc.  This is the last
dealing but two between dealer and dealers.  The
flax-grower and machine builder buy iron, machines, etc.,
and so on.  But the dealings between the producers of
flax, machinery, iron, coal, [which are carried out] to
replace their constant capital, and the value of these
dealings, do not enter into the dealings which A’s product
passes through, whether as the exchange of revenue for
revenue, or as the exchange of revenue for constant
capital.  These dealings—not those between the
producers of B and the producers of A, but those between the
producers of B— have not to be replaced by the buyer
of A to the seller of A, any more than the value of this
part of B enters into the value of A.  These dealings
too require money, and are carried out through
merchants.  But the part of the circulation of money
which exclusively belongs to this sphere is completely
separate from that between dealers and consumers.&gt;</p>
<p><span class="context">||391|</span> Two questions are
still to be solved:</p>
<p><i>1</i>.  In our investigation up to now wages have
been treated as revenue, without being distinguished from
profit.  How far in this connection have we to take
account of the fact that wages are at the same time part of
the circulating capital of the capitalist?</p>
<p>2.  Up to now it has been assumed that the total
revenue is spent as revenue.  The alteration that comes
in when a part of the revenue, of the profit, is
capitalised, has therefore to be considered.  This in
fact comes up in the examination of the process of
accumulation—but not in its formal aspect.  That
a part of the product which represents surplus-value is
reconverted, partly into wages and partly into constant
capital, presents no difficulty.  Here we have to
examine how this affects the exchange of commodities under
the headings previously considered—under which it can
be examined in relation for its holders, that is to say, as
exchange of revenue for revenue, exchange of revenue for
capital, or finally, exchange of capital for capital.}</p>
<p>&lt;This intermezzo has therefore to be completed in this
historico-critical section, as occasion warrants.&gt;</p>

Polemics against Smith’s Theory of Productive Labour and the

<p>Ferrier (François-Louis-Auguste) (<i>Sub-inspector

the main source for Friedrich List.) This fellow eulogises
the <i>Bonapartist</i> system of prohibitions, etc.  In
fact the Government (therefore also State officials
—those unproductive labourers) is in his view
important, as a manager directly intervening in
production.  This customs officer is consequently
extremely angry with Adam Smith for calling State officials
unproductive.</p>
<p class="quote">“The principles which Smith <i>has
laid down in regard to the economy of nations</i> have as
their basis a distinction in labour, which he calls
productive or unproductive …” </p>
<p>&lt;Because in fact he wants the largest possible part to
be spent as capital, i.e., in exchange for productive
labour, and the smallest possible part as revenue, in
exchange for unproductive labour.&gt;</p>
<p class="quote">“This distinction is in essence
false.  <i>There is no unproductive labour</i>”
(p. 141).  “There is therefore economy and
prodigality on the part of nations; but a nation is only
prodigal or economic in its relations with <i>other</i>
peoples, and it is from this standpoint that the question
should be considered” (l.c., p. 143).</p>
<p>In a moment we shall quote for comparison the context of
the passage from Adam Smith which Ferrier regards with such
abomination.</p>
<p class="quote">“There is an economy on the part of
nations, hut it is very different from what Smith
recommends…, It consists in not buying foreign
products except in so far as a nation can pay for them with
its own, It consists sometimes in doing without them
altogether” (l.c., pp. 174-75).</p>
<p>&lt;Book I, Chapter VI, (t. I, éd.  Garnier,
pp. 108-09) <i>Adam Smith</i> says at the end of this
chapter which deals with the component parts of the price of
commodities:</p>
<p class="quote">“As in a civilised country there are
<i>but few commodities of which the exchangeable value
arises from labour only, rent and profit contributing
largely to that of the far greater part of them, so the
annual produce of its labour will always be sufficient to
purchase or command a much greater quantity of labour than
what was employed in raising, preparing, and bringing that
pro duce to market.  1f the society were annually to
employ all the labour which it can annually purchase, as the
quantity of labour would increase greatly every year</i>, so
the produce of every succeeding year would be of vastly
greater value than that of the foregoing.  But there is
no country <i>in which the whole annual produce</i> is
employed in maintaining the industrious.  The idle
everywhere consume a great part of it; and, according to the
different proportions in which it is annually divided
between those two different orders of people, its ordinary
or average value must either annually increase or diminish,
or continue the same from one year to another” [Smith,
<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, O.U.P. edition, Vol. 1,
pp. 59-60].</p>
<p>There is confusion of all kinds in this passage, in which
Smith is in fact trying to solve the problem of
accumulation.</p>
<p>First, once again there is the wrong assumption that the
“exchangeable value” of the annual product of
labour, and so also “<i>the annual produce of
labour</i>”, resolves itself into wages and profits
(including rents).  We will not deal again with this
nonsense.  We only observe: the amount of the annual
product—or of the funds, the stocks of commodities
which are the annual product of labour—consists for
the most part <span class="context">||392|</span> of
commodities in kind which can only enter as elements into
constant capital &lt;raw materials, seed, machinery,
etc.&gt;, which can <i>only</i> be consumed
industrially.  The very <i>use-value</i> of these
commodities (and they form the larger part of the
commodities entering into constant capital) shows that they
are not suitable for individual consumption; that therefore
revenue cannot be expended on them, whether it is wages,
profit or rent.  A part of the raw materials (in so far
as it is not required for the reproduction of raw materials
themselves, or in so far as it does not enter into the fixed
capital as auxiliary material or directly as a component
part) will, it is true, later on be given a consumable form,
but only through the labour of the current year.  As a
product of the previous year’s labour these raw materials
themselves form no part of revenue.  It is only the
consumable part of the product that can be consumed, can
enter into individual consumption and thus form
revenue.  But even a part of the consumable product
cannot be consumed without making reproduction
impossible.  One part even of the consumable part of
commodities therefore must be deducted which must be
<i>consumed industrially</i>, that is, it must serve as
material of labour, as seed, etc., not as means of
subsistence, whether for labourers or for capitalists. 
This part of the product therefore has first to be deducted
from Adam Smith’s calculation—or rather has to be
added to it.  <i>If the productivity of labour remains
the same</i>, then this part of the <i>product</i> which
does not consist of revenue remains the same from year to
year; provided that, with the productivity of labour
remaining the same, the same quantity of labour-time as
before is employed.</p>
<p>On the assumption therefore that <i>a greater
quantity</i> of labour than before is used each year, we
have to see what happens to the constant capital.  In
short: in order to employ a greater quantity of labour, it
is not enough either that a <i>greater quantity of
labour</i> should be available, or that a <i>greater
quantity should be paid for</i>, that is, more should be
spent in wages; but the means of labour—raw material
and fixed capital—must also be there in order to
absorb a greater quantity of labour.  Hence this point
<i>is</i> still to be discussed <i>after</i> the points
raised by Adam Smith have been cleared up.</p>
<p>So then, once more [we take] his first sentence:</p>
<p class="quote">“As in a civilised country there are
but few commodities of which the exchangeable value
<i>arises from labour only, rent and profit contributing
largely</i> to that of the far greater part of them, <i>so
the annual produce of its labour will</i> always he
sufficient <i>to purchase or command a much greater quantity
of labour</i> than <i>what was employed in raising</i>,
preparing, and bringing that produce to market” (in
other words, to produce it).</p>
<p>Here different things are obviously mixed up.  Not
only living labour, living labour employed during the
current year, enters into the exchangeable value of the
total annual product, but also past labour, product of the
labour of past years.  Not only labour in living form,
but labour in materialised form.  The exchangeable
value of the product is equal to the total labour-time which
it contains, a part of which consisted of living labour and
a part of materialised labour.</p>
<p>Let the proportion of the former to the latter be as
<sup class="ratio">1</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> : <sup class="ratio">2</sup>/<sub class="ratio">3</sub> or 1 :
2.  Then the value of the total product is equal to 3,
of which 2 are materialised labour-time and 1 living
labour-time.  The <i>value</i> of the total product can
therefore buy more living labour than is contained in it, on
the assumption that materialised labour and living labour
exchanged for each other as equivalents, that a definite
quantity of materialised labour commanded only a quantity of
living labour equal to itself.  For the product is
equal to 3 days’ labour; but the living labour-time
contained in it is only equal to 1 day’s labour.  1
day’s living labour sufficed to produce the product (in
fact, only to give the final form to its elements). 
But 3 days’ labour is contained in it.  Therefore if it
was exchanged entirely against living labour-time, if it was
employed only “to purchase or command”
quantities of living labour, it would be able to command, to
purchase, 3 days’ labour.</p>
<p>This however is evidently not what Adam Smith has in
mind, and would be a quite useless premise for him. 
What he means is that a large part of the exchangeable value
of the product does not resolve itself (or as he
<i>wrongly</i> expresses it, because of a confusion of ideas
noted earlier) into wages but into profits and rents, or, as
we will say to simplify things, into profits.  In other
words, the part of the value of the product which is equal
to the quantity of labour added during the last
year—thus in fact the part of the product which in the
proper meaning of the word is the product of last year’s
labour—pays first the labourers and secondly enters
into the capitalist’s revenue, his fund for
consumption.  This whole part of the total product
arises from labour, and indeed exclusively from labour; but
it consists of paid and unpaid labour.  The wages are
equal to the total of the paid labour, the profits <span class="context">||393|</span> to the total of the unpaid
labour.  If therefore this total product was expended
in wages, it could naturally set in motion a greater
quantity of labour than that of which it was the product;
and in fact the proportion in which the product can set in
motion more labour-time than it itself contains depends
exactly on the proportion in which the working-day is
divided into paid and unpaid labour-time.</p>
<p>Let us assume that the proportion is such that the
labourer produces or reproduces his wages in 6 hours, that
is, in half a day.  Then the other 6 hours or the other
half day forms the surplus.  Thus for example of a
product which contained 100 days’ labour [newly-added
labour], equal to £50 (when the day’s labour is equal
to 10s., making 100 days’ labour equal to 1,000s., or
£50), there would be £25 for wages and £25
for profit (rent).  With the £25—equal to
50 days’ labour—l00 labourers would have been paid,
who would have worked precisely half their labour-time for
nothing or for their masters.  If therefore the whole
product (of the 100 days’ labour) were to be expended in
wages, then 200 labourers could be set in motion with the
£50, each of whom would receive as wages 5s.  or
half the product of his labour as before.  The product
of this labour would be equal to £100 (that is, 200
days’ labour, equal to 2,000s., or £100), with which
400 labourers (5s. the labourer, making 2,000s.) could be
set in motion, whose product would be equal to £200,
and so on.</p>
<p>And this is what Adam Smith means by saying that
“the annual produce of labour” will always be
sufficient “to purchase or command a much greater
quantity of labour” than what was employed to produce
the product.  (If the labourer were paid the whole
product of his labour, that is, £50 for 100 days’
labour, then the £50 too could only set in motion 100
days’ labour.) And so Smith goes on to say:</p>
<p class="quote">“if the society were annually to
employ all the labour which it can annually purchase, as the
quantity of labour would increase greatly every year, so the
produce of every succeeding year would be of vastly greater
value than that of the foregoing.”</p>
<p>A part of this product however is consumed by the owners
of profit and rent; a part by their parasites.  The
part of the product that can be expended again in
(productive) labour is consequently determined by the part
of the product which the capitalists, landlords and their
parasites (that is the unproductive labourers) do not
themselves consume.</p>
<p>But nevertheless there is always a new fund (a new fund
of wages) to set in motion, with the previous year’s
product, a greater quantity of labourers in the current
year.  And as the value of the annual product is
determined by the quantity of labour-time employed, the
value of the annual product will grow each year.</p>
<p>Of course it would be of no use to have the fund
“<i>to purchase</i> or <i>command</i>” a
“much greater quantity of labour” than in the
previous year unless a greater quantity of labour was on the
market.  It is of no use to me to have more money to
buy a commodity, unless more of this commodity is on the
market.  Let us assume that the £50 set in
motion, instead of the 100 as before (who received
£25), not 200 but only 150 labourers, while the
capitalists themselves consumed £12.l0s.  instead
of £25.  The 150 labourers ([receiving]
£37.l0s.) would perform 150 days’ labour, equal to
1,500s.  or £75.  But if the quantity of
labourers available were, as before, only 100, instead of
£25 as before, they would receive £37.l0s, as
wages, though their product [would amount to I only
£50 as before.  Thus the revenue of the
capitalist would have fallen from £25 to
£l2.l0s., because wages had risen by 50 per
cent.  Adam Smith knows, however, that an increasing
quantity of labour will be available.  Partly [due to]
the annual increase of the population (though this is
supposed to be provided for in the old wages), partly
unemployed paupers, or half-employed labourers, etc. 
Then the large numbers of unproductive labourers, part of
whom can be transformed into <i>productive</i> labourers by
a different way of using the surplus-produce.  Finally
the same number of labourers can perform a <i>greater
quantity</i> of labour.  And whether I pay 125
labourers instead of 100, or whether the 100 work 15 hours a
day instead of 12, would be quite the same thing.</p>
<p>It is incidentally an error of Adam
Smith’s—directly connected with his analysis of the
total product into revenue—to say that with the
increase of the productive capital—or with the growth
of the part of the annual product which is destined for
reproduction—the <i>labour employed</i> (the living
labour, the part of capital expended in wages) must increase
in the same proportion.</p>
<p><span class="context">||394|</span> Thus first Adam Smith
has a fund of consumable means of subsistence, which can
“purchase or command” a greater quantity of
labour this year than the foregoing year; he has more
labour; and at the same time more means of subsistence for
this labour.  Now we must see how this additional
quantity of labour is to be realised.&gt;</p>
<p>Had Adam Smith adhered with full consciousness to the
analysis of surplus-value which in substance is to be found
in his work—which is created only in the exchange of
capital against wage-labour—it would have followed
that productive labour is only that which is exchanged
against capital: never labour which is exchanged with
revenue as such.  In order for revenue to be exchanged
against productive labour, it must first be transformed into
capital.</p>
<p>But taking as his starting-point one aspect of the
traditional view—that productive labour is labour
which directly produces material wealth of any
kind—and at the same time combining with this his
distinction in so far as it is based on the exchange of
either capital for labour or of revenue for labour, with
Smith the following became possible: The kind of labour for
which capital is exchanged is always productive (it always
creates material wealth, etc.).  The kind of labour
which is exchanged for revenue may be productive or it may
not; but the spender of revenue as a rule prefers to set in
motion directly unproductive labour rather than
productive.  One can see how Adam Smith, by this
compound of his two distinctions, very much weakens and
blunts the principal distinction.</p>
<p>The following quotation shows that Adam Smith does not
take the fixation of labour in a purely external sense;
among the various component parts of the fixed capital is
enumerated:</p>
<p class="quote">“Fourthly, of the acquired and useful
abilities of all the inhabitants and members of the
society.  The acquisition of such talents, by the
maintenance of the acquirer during his education, study, or
apprenticeship, always costs a real expense, which is a
capital fixed and realised, as it were, in his person. 
Those talents, as they make a part of his fortune, so do
they likewise that of the society to which he be
Longs.  The improved dexterity of a workman may be
considered in the same light as a machine or instrument of
trade which facilitates and abridges labour, and which,
though it costs a certain expense, repays that expense with
a profit” ([<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, O.U.P,
edition, Vol. I, p. 308], [Garnier], l.c., t. II, ch, I,
pp. 204-05).</p>
<p>The strange origin of accumulation and its necessity:</p>
<p class="quote">“In that rude state of society, in
which there is no division of labour, in which exchanges are
seldom made, and in which every man provides every thing for
himself, <i>it is not necessary that any stock should be
accumulated, or stored up beforehand, in order to carry on
the business of the society</i>” (that is, after
assuming that there is no society).  “Every man
endeavours to supply, by his own industry, his own
occasional wants, as they occur.  When he is hungry, he
goes to the forest to hunt”—and so on ([ibid.,
p.301], [Garnier], l.c., t, II, pp. 191-92) (l. II,
<i>Introduction</i>).  “But when the division of
labour has once been thoroughly introduced, the produce of a
man’s own labour can supply but a vary small part of his
occasional wants.  The far greater part of them are
supplied by <i>the produce of other men’s labour</i>, [which
he purchases with the produce ], or, what is the same thing,
the price of the produce of his own, But this
<i>purchase</i> cannot be made till such time as <i>the
produce of his own labour</i> has not only been
<i>completed</i>, but <i>sold</i>.”</p>
<p>(Even in the first case he could not eat the hare before
he had killed it, and he could not kill it before he had
produced for himself the classical “bow” or
something similar.  The only thing that seems to be
added in case II is therefore not the necessity of a stock
of any sort, but the “time… <i>to sell</i> the
produce of his labour”.)</p>
<p class="quote">“<i>A stock of goods of different
kinds</i>, therefore, must be <i>stored up</i> somewhere,
sufficient to maintain him, and to supply him with the
materials and tools of his work, till such time at least as
both these events can be brought about.  A weaver
<i>cannot apply himself entirely</i> to his peculiar
business, unless there is beforehand stored up somewhere,
<i>either in his own possession</i>, <i>or in that of some
other persons, a stock</i> sufficient to maintain him, and
to supply him with the materials and tools of his work, till
he has not only completed, but sold his web.  This
<i>accumulation must</i> evidently <i>be previous</i> to his
applying his industry for so long a time to such a peculiar
business, … <i>The accumulation of s t o c k
must</i>, in the nature of things, <i>be previous to the
division of labour</i>…” ([ibid., pp. 301-02],
[Garnier], l.c., pp. 192-93).</p>
<p>(On the other hand, according to what he has stated at
the beginning, it appears that no accumulation of capital
takes place <i>before</i> the division of labour, just as
there is no division of labour before the accumulation of
capital.)</p>
<p>He continues:</p>
<p class="quote">“… Labour can be more and more
subdivided in proportion only as stock is previously more
and more accumulated.  <i>The quantity of materials
which the same number of people can work up, increases in a
great proportion</i> as labour comes to be more and more
subdivided; and as the operations of each workman are
gradually reduced to a greater degree of simplicity, a
variety of new machines come to be invented for facilitating
and <span class="context">||395|</span> abridging those
operations.  As the division of labour advances,
therefore, in order to give constant employment to an equal
number of workmen, <i>an equal stock of provisions, and a
greater stock of materials and tools</i> than what would
have been necessary in a ruder state of things, must be
<i>accumulated be forehand</i>”, ([ibid., p. 302],
[Garnier], l.c., pp. 193-94).  “As <i>the
accumulation of stock is previously necessary</i> for
carrying on this great improvement in the productive powers
of labour, so that accumulation naturally leads to this
improvement.  <i>The person who employs his stock in
maintaining labour</i>, necessarily wishes to employ it in
such a manner as to produce as great a quantity of work as
possible.  He endeavours, therefore, both to make among
his workmen the most proper distribution of employment, and
to furnish them with the best machines which he can either
invent or afford to purchase.  His abilities, in both
these respects, are generally in proportion to the extent of
his stock, or to the number of people whom it can
employ.  <i>The quantity of industry</i>, therefore,
<i>not only increases in every country with the increase of
the stock</i> which employs it, but, <i>in consequence of
that increase</i>, the same <i>quantity of industry produces
a much greater quantity of work” (</i> [ibid.,
pp. 302-03], [Garnier], l.c., pp. 194-95).</p>
<p>Adam Smith treats the objects which are already in the
fund for consumption in exactly the same way as productive
and unproductive labour.  For instance:</p>
<p class="quote">“A dwelling-house, as such,
contributes nothing to the revenue of its inhabitant; and
though it is, no doubt, extremely useful to him, it is as
his clothes and household furniture are useful to him,
which, however, make a part of his expense, and not of his
revenue” ( [ibid., pp. 306-07 ], [Garnier], l.c.,
t. 11, pp. 201-02).  On the other hand, fixed capital
includes “all those profitable buildings which are the
means of procuring a revenue, not only to their proprietor
who lets them for a rent, but to the person who possesses
them, and pays that rent for them; such as shops,
warehouses, workhouses, farm-houses, with all their
necessary buildings, stables, granaries, etc, These are very
different from mere dwelling-houses.  They are a sort
of instruments of trade… “ ( [ibid., p. 308 ],
[Garnier], l.c., t. II, pp. 203-04).</p>
<p class="quote">“… All such improvements in
mechanics, as enable the same number of workmen to perform
an equal quantity of work with cheaper and simpler machinery
than had been usual before, are always regarded as
advantageous to every society.  A certain quantity of
materials, and the labour of a certain number of workmen,
which had before been employed in supporting a more complex
and expensive machinery, can afterwards be applied to
augment the quantity of work which that or any other
machinery is useful only for performing” ( [ibid.,
p. 315 ], [Garnier], l.c., t, II, pp. 216-17).</p>
<p class="quote">“… The whole expense of
maintaining the <i>fixed capital is</i> … necessarily
excluded from the neat revenue of the society” (
[ibid., p. 316 ], [Garnier], l.c., t, II, p. 218). 
“Every saving, therefore, in the expense of
maintaining the <i>fixed capital</i>, which does not
diminish the productive powers of labour, must increase the
fund which puts industry into motion, and consequently the
annual produce of land and labour, the real revenue of every
society” ( [ibid., p. 321 ], [Garnier ], l.c., t. II,
pp.  226-27).</p>
<p class="quote">Gold and silver money forced to go abroad
by bank-notes and by paper money in general—if spent
“in purchasing foreign goods for home
consumption”—buys either luxury products such as
foreign wines, foreign silks, etc., in a word, “goods
… likely to be consumed by <i>idle people</i>, who
produce nothing… or .., they may purchase <i>on
additional stock of materials, toots, and provisions, in
order to maintain and employ an additional number of
industrious people, who reproduce, with a profit, the value
of their annual consumption</i>” ([ibid., p. 324],
[Garnier], l.c., t. II, pp. 231-32).</p>
<p class="quote">The first manner of employment, says Smith, promotes
prodigality, “increases expense and consumption,
without increasing production, or establishing any permanent
fund for supporting that expense, and is in every respect
hurtful to the society” ([ibid., p. 324],
[Garnier], l.c., t. II, p. 232).  On the other hand
“employed in the second way, it promotes industry; and
though it increases the consumption of the society, it
provides a permanent fund for supporting that consumption;
<i>the people who consume reproducing, with a profit, the
whole value of their annual consumption</i>” ( [ibid.,
p. 324], [Garnier], l.c., t, II, p. 232).</p>
<p class="quote">“The quantity of industry which any
capital can employ, must evidently be equal to the number of
workmen whom it can supply with materials, tools, and a
maintenance suitable to the nature of the work” (
[ibid., p.326], [Garnier], l.c., t, II, p. 235).</p>
<p><span class="context">||396|</span> In <i>Chapter III of
Book II</i> (l.c., t. II, p. 314 sqq.) [we find]:</p>
<p class="quote">“Both productive and unproductive
labourers, and those who do not labour at all, are all
equally maintained by the annual produce of the land and
labour of the country.  This produce … must have
certain limits.  According, therefore, as a smaller or
greater proportion of it is in any one year employed in
maintaining unproductive hands, the more in the one case,
and the less in the other, will remain for the productive,
and the next year’s produce will be greater or smaller
accordingly… </p>
<p class="quote">“Though the whole annual produce of
the land and labour of every country is … ultimately
destined for supplying the consumption of its inhabitants,
and for procuring a revenue to them; <i>yet when it
first</i> comes either from the ground, or from the hands of
the productive labourers, it naturally divides itself into
two parts.  One of them, and frequently the largest,
is, in the first place, destined for <i>replacing a capital,
or for renewing the p r o v i s i o n s, materials,
and finished work</i>, which had been withdrawn from a
capital; the other for constituting a revenue either to the
owner of this capital, as the profit of his stock, or to
some other person, as the rent of his land… </p>
<p class="quote">“<i>That part of the annual produce
of the land and labour of any country which replaces a
capital</i>, never is immediately employed to maintain any
but productive hands.  It pays the wages of productive
labour only.  That which is immediately destined for
constituting a revenue… may maintain indifferently
either productive or unproductive hands.  …</p>
<p class="quote">“Unproductive labourers, and those
who do not labour at all, are all maintained <i>by
revenue;</i> either, first, by that part of the annual
produce which is originally destined for constituting a
revenue to some particular persons, either as the rent of
land, or as the profits of stock; or, secondly, by the part
which, though originally destined for replacing a capital,
and for maintaining productive labourers only, yet when it
comes into their hands, whatever part of it is over and
above their necessary subsistence, may be employed in
maintaining indifferently either productive or unproductive
hands.  Thus … even the common workman, if his
wages are considerable, may maintain a menial servant; or he
may sometimes go to a play or a puppet-show, and so
contribute his share towards maintaining one set of
unproductive labourers; or he may pay some taxes, and thus
help to maintain another set … equally unproductive,
No part of the annual produce, however, which had been
originally destined to replace a capital, is ever directed
towards maintaining unproductive hands, till after it has
put into motion its full complement of productive labour,
… The workman must have earned his wages by work
done, before he can employ any part of them in this
manner,.,, The rent of land and the profits of stock are
everywhere… the principal sources from which
unproductive hands derive their subsistence, “ These
two sorts of revenue “might both maintain
indifferently, either productive or unproductive
hands.  They seem, however, to have some predilection
for the latter….</p>
<p class="quote"> “The proportion, therefore,
between the productive and unproductive hands, depends very
much in every country upon the proportion between that part
of the annual produce, which, as soon as it comes either
from the ground, or from the hands of the productive
labourers is destined for replacing a capital, and that
which is destined for constituting a revenue, either as rent
or as profit.  This proportion is very different in
rich from what it is in poor countries” [<i>Wealth of
Nations</i>, O.U.P.  edition, Vol. I, pp. 370-73].</p>
<p class="quote">[Adam Smith] then contrasts the “very
large, frequently the largest, portion of the produce of the
land” which “in the opulent countries of Europe
[…] is <i>destined for replacing the capital of the
rich and independent farmer”with</i> “the
prevalency of the feudal government”, when “a
very small portion of the produce was sufficient to replace
the capital employed in cultivation”.</p>
<p>It is the same with commerce and manufactures. 
Large capitals are now employed in them, formerly very small
capitals, but they</p>
<p class="quote">“yielded very large profits. 
The rate of interest was nowhere less than ten per cent, and
their profits must have been sufficient to afford this great
interest.  At present, the rate of interest, in the
improved parts of Europe, is nowhere higher than six per
cent; and in some of the most improved, it is so low as
four, three, and two per cent.  Though that part of the
revenue of the inhabitants which is derived from the profits
of stock, is always much greater in rich than in poor
countries, it is because the stock is much greater; in
proportion to the stock, the profits are generally much
less.</p>
<p class="quote">“That part of the annual produce,
therefore, which, as soon as it comes either from the
ground, or from the hands of the productive labourers, is
destined for replacing a capital, <span class="context">||397|</span> is not only much greater in
rich than in poor countries, but bears a much greater
proportion to that which is immediately destined for
constituting a revenue either as rent or as profit. 
The funds destined for the maintenance of productive labour
are not only much greater in the former than in the latter,
but bear a much greater proportion to those which, though
they may be employed to maintain either productive or
unproductive hands, have generally a predilection for the
latter,”</p>
<p>(Smith falls into the error of identifying the size of
the productive capital with the <i>size of that part of
it</i> which is destined to provide subsistence for
productive labour.  But in fact large-scale industry,
as he knew it, was as yet only in its beginnings.)</p>
<p class="quote">“The proportion between those
different funds necessarily determines in every country the
general character of the inhabitants as to industry or
idleness.” Thus he says for example: in English and
Dutch manufacturing towns “where the inferior ranks of
people are chiefly maintained by the employment of capital,
they are in general industrious, sober and
thriving”.  On the other hand, in “towns
which are principally supported by the [constant or
occasional] residence of a court, and in which the inferior
ranks of people are chiefly maintained by the spending of
revenue, they are in general idle, dissolute, and poor; as
at Rome, Versailles”,<a href="#_ftn23" id="_ftnref23">*</a> etc.  [ibid., pp. 372-75].</p>
<p class="quote">“The proportion between capital and
revenue, therefore, seems everywhere to regulate the
proportion between industry and idleness.  Wherever
capital predominates, industry prevails: wherever revenue,
idleness.  <i>Every increase or diminution of
capital</i>, therefore, naturally tends to increase or
diminish the real quantity of industry, the number of
productive hands, and consequently the exchangeable value of
the anneal produce of the land and labour of the country,
the real wealth and revenue of all its inhabitants. 
…</p>
<p class="quote">“What is annually saved, is as
regularly consumed as what is annually spent, and nearly in
the same time, too: but it is consumed by a different set of
people.” The first portion “by idle guests and
menial servants, who leave nothing behind them in return for
their consumption”.  The second [portion]
“by labourers […] who, reproduce, with a
profit, the value of their annual consumption… 
The consumption is the same, but the consumers are
different” [ibid., pp. 377-78].</p>
<p>Hence Smith’s homilies (further on [Garnier], 1, c.,
t. II, l.       II, ch. III,
pp. 328-29 sqq.) on the frugal man, who by his annual
savings provides something like a public workhouse for an
additional number of productive hands, and thus</p>
<p class="quote">“establishes, as it were, a perpetual
fund for the maintenance of an equal number in all times to
come”, while the prodigal diminishes “the funds
destined for the employment of productive
labour…  If the quantity of food and clothing,
which were thus” (as a result of the prodigal’s
prodigality) “consumed by unproductive, had been
distributed among productive hands, they would have
<i>reproduced, together with a profit</i>, the full value of
their consumption” [ibid., pp. 378-79].</p>
<p>The conclusion of this moral tale is that these
(frugality and prodigality) average out among private
individuals, that in fact “wisdom” prevails.</p>
<p class="quote">“Great nations are never impoverished
by private, though they sometimes are by public prodigality
and misconduct.  The whole, or almost the whole public
revenue is, in most countries, employed in maintaining
unproductive hands.” [These include] the people of the
court, the church, fleets and armies, “who in time of
peace produce nothing, and in time of war acquire nothing
which can compensate the expense of maintaining them, even
while the war lasts.  <i>Such people, as they
themselves produce nothing, are all maintained by the
produce of other men’s labour</i>.  When multiplied,
therefore, to an unnecessary number, they may in a
particular year consume so great a share of this produce, ns
not to leave a sufficiency for maintaining the productive
labourers, who should reproduce it next year” [ibid.,
pp. 382-83].</p>
<p>[In] Chapter IV of Book II [Smith writes]:</p>
<p class="quote">“The demand for productive labour, by
the increase of the funds which are destined for maintaining
it, grows every day greater and greater. 
Labourers easily find <span class="context">||398|</span>
employment; but the owners of capitals find it
difficult.  To get labourers to employ.  Their
competition raises the wages of labour, and sinks the
profits of stock” ([ibid., p. 395], [Garnier], l.c.,
t. II, p. 359).</p>
<p>In Chapter V of Book II (p. 369 sqq., t. II) of the
“<i>Different Employments of Capitals</i>”,
Smith classifies them according as they employ more or less
productive labour, and, consequently, raise “the
exchange-value” of the annual product.  First
<i>agriculture</i>.  Then <i>manufacture</i>. 
Then <i>commerce</i>, and finally <i>retail trade</i>. 
This is the order of precedence in which they set in motion
quantities of productive labour.  Here too we get a
completely new definition of productive labourers:</p>
<p class="quote">“The persons whose capitals are
employed in any of those four ways, are themselves
<i>productive labourers</i>.  Their labour, when
properly directed, fixes and realises itself in the subject
or vendible commodity upon which it is bestowed, and
generally adds to its price the value at least of their own
maintenance and consumption” ([ibid., p. 404],
[Garnier], l.c., p. 374).</p>
<p>(On the whole he sees their productivity in the fact that
they put into motion productive labour.)</p>
<p>He says of <i>the farmer:</i></p>
<p class="quote">“No equal capital puts into motion a
greater quantity of <i>productive labour</i> than that of
the farmer, Not only his labouring servants, but <i>his
labouring cattle are productive labourers</i>” [ibid.,
p. 405.].</p>
<p>So in the end the ox too is a productive labourer.</p>

Ruling Classes as Representatives of the Most Important
Kinds of Productive Labour]</h3>
<p><i>Lauderdale</i> (Earl of): <i>An Inquiry into the
Nature and Origin of Public Wealth</i>, etc., [Edinburgh
and] London, 1804.  (The French translation:
<i>Recherches</i><i> sur la nature et l’origine de la
richesse publique</i> etc.  par <i>Lagentie de
Lavaïsse</i>, Paris, 1808.)</p>
<p>Lauderdale’s apologetic justification of profit will be
examined only later on, in Section III.  It regards
profit as arising from capitals themselves, because they
“<i>supplant</i>” labour.  They are paid
for doing what otherwise, without them, the hand of man
would have to do, or could not do at all.</p>
<p class="quote">“Now it is apprehended, that in every
instance where capital is so employed as to produce a
profit, it uniformly arises, either—from its
supplanting a portion of labour which would otherwise be
performed by the hand of man; or—from its performing a
portion of labour, which is beyond the personal exertion of
man to accomplish” (French translation, p. 119)<a href="#_ftn24" id="_ftnref24">*</a> [p. 161].</p>
<p>The “Earl” is a great enemy of Smith’s
doctrine of accumulation and saving, Also of his distinction
between <i>productive</i> and <i>unproductive labourers;</i>
but according to him what Smith calls “productive
powers of labour” are only the “productive power
of capital”.  He flatly denies the derivation of
surplus-value put forward by Smith, on the following
grounds:</p>
<p class="quote">“If this, however, was a just and
accurate idea of the profit of capital, it would follow that
the profit of stock must be derivative, and not an original
source of revenue: and capital could not therefore be
considered as a source of wealth, its profit being only a
transfer from the pocket of the labourer into that of the
proprietor of stock” (l.c., pp. 116-17) [p. 157 ].</p>
<p>It is clear that on these premises he picks on the most
superficial points in his polemic against Smith.  Thus
he says:</p>
<p class="quote">“Thus the same labour may appear
either productive or unproductive, according to the use
subsequently made of the commodity on which it was
bestowed.  If my cook, for example, makes a tart which
I immediately consume, he is considered as an unproductive
labourer; and the net of making the tart is unproductive
labour: because that service has perished at the moment of
its performance: but if the same labour is performed in a
pastry cook’s shop, it becomes productive labour”
(l.c., p. 110) [pp. 149-50].</p>
<p>(<i>Garnier</i> has the copyright in this argument, as
his edition and notes on Smith appeared in 1802, two years
before Lauderdale.)</p>
<p class="quote">“This extraordinary distinction,
founded on the mere durability of the services performed,
classes as unproductive labourers some of those who are
occupied in rendering the most important services to
society.  Thus the sovereign, and all who are employed
in the maintenance of religion, the justice, or the defence
of the State, as well as those whose skill and care are
occupied in superintending the health and education of the
society, are alike deemed unproductive Labourers”
(l.c., pp. 110-11) [p. 151 ], (Or, as Adam Smith [Garnier
trans.]  l. II, ch. III, p. 313) presents the elegant
sequence: “churchmen, lawyers, physicians, men of
letters of all kinds; players, buffoons, musicians,
opera-singers, opera-dancers, etc.” [<i>Wealth of
Nations</i>, O.U.P, edition, Vol. I, p. 370 ].)</p>
<p class="quote">“If exchangeable value is to be
considered as the basis of wealth,—it is needless to
use much argument to explain the errors of this
doctrine.  <span class="context">||399|</span> The
practice of mankind, in estimating these services, if we can
judge by what is paid for them, bears sufficient testimony
of its inaccuracy” ( [Lauderdale ], l.c., p. 111) [pp.
151-52].</p>
<p>Further: “The labour of the manufacturer fixes and
realises itself in some vendible commodity… 
Neither the <i>labour performed by the menial servant</i>,
nor that of which the necessity is supplanted by circulating
capital,” &lt; by this he means <i>money</i>&gt;
“do naturally stock, or store themselves up in such a
manner as to be transferred from one to another for a
defined value.  The profit of the one and the other
alike arises from <i>saving the labour of the owner</i> or
master.  The similarity is indeed such that it is
natural to suppose the same circumstances which led the one
to be deemed unproductive, would naturally create the same
impression with relation to the other.” &gt; And
thereupon he quotes Smith, Book II, Chapter II, &gt;
(Lauderdale, l.c., pp. 144-45) [pp.  195-97].</p>
<h4>***</h4>
<p>Thus we would have the succession: Ferrier, Garnier,
Lauderdale, Ganilh.  The latter phrase about the
“<i>saving of labour</i>” is particularly hard
ridden by <i>Tocqueville</i>.</p>
<p><a id="s13"> </a></p>
<h3>[13.  Say’s Conception of “Immaterial
Products”.  Vindication of an Unrestrained Growth
of Unproductive Labour]</h3>
<p>After Garnier appeared the inane Jean-Baptiste Say’s
<i>Traité d’économie politique</i>.  He
reproaches Smith in that “he refuses the name of
<i>products</i> to the <i>results</i> of these activities
[e.g., those of the physician, actor, etc.].  He gives
the labour spent on them the name <i>unproductive</i>”
(3me éd., t. I, p. 117).</p>
<p>Smith does not at all deny that these activities produce
a “result”, a “product” of some
kind.  He even expressly mentions “the
protection, security, and defence of the commonwealth”
as “the effect of their labour this year” (the
labour of the servants of the public) ([<i>Wealth of
Nations</i>], O.U.P. edition, Vol. I, pp. 369-70]
<i>Smith</i>, t. II, éd, Garnier, l. II, ch. III,
p. 313).</p>
<p>Say for his part sticks to Smith’s secondary definition,
that these “services” and their product
“generally perish in the very instant of their
performance”, “in the very instant of their
production” (<i>Smith</i>, l.c.).</p>
<p>Monsieur Say calls these consumed “services”,
or their products, results—in a word, their
use-value—“immaterial products or values, which
are consumed in the instant of their
production”.  Instead of calling them
“unproductive”, he calls them “productive
of immaterial products”.  He gives them another
name.  But then he declares further:</p>
<p class="quote">“that they do not serve to augment
the national capital” (t, I, p. 119).  “A
nation in which there were a multitude of musicians, priests
and officials, might be pleasantly entertained, well
educated and governed admirably well, but that would be all,
Its capital would not receive any direct increase from all
the labour of these industrious men, because their products
would be, consumed as fast as they were created”
(l.c., p. 119).</p>
<p>Thus Monsieur Say declares these labours to be
<i>unproductive</i> in the most restricted sense used by
Smith.  But at the same time he wants to appropriate
Garnier’s “step forward”.  Hence he invents
a new name for unproductive labours.  This is his kind
of originality, his kind of productivity and way of making
discoveries, And with his customary logic, he refutes
himself again, He says:</p>
<p class="quote">“It is […] impossible to
accept the view of Monsieur Garnier, who concludes from the
fact that the labour of physicians, lawyers and other
similar persons is productive, that it is as advantageous
for a nation to increase it as any other labour”
(l.c., p. 120).</p>
<p>And why not, if one kind of labour is as productive as
the other, and the increase of productive labour is in
general “advantageous for a nation”?  Why
is it not as advantageous to increase this kind of
labour as any other?  Because, Say replies with his
characteristic profundity, because it is not at all
advantageous to increase productive labour of any kind above
the need for this labour.  But then surely Garnier is
right.  For it is equally advantageous—that is,
equally disadvantageous— to increase the one kind of
labours as to increase the other kind above a certain
quantity.</p>
<p class="quote">“The case is the same,” Say
continues.  “as with physical labour expended on
a product beyond what is necessary to make it.”</p>
<p>(Not more joiner’s labour should be employed to make a
table than is necessary for the production of the
table.  Or to patch up a sick body, not more than is
necessary to cure it.  So lawyers and physicians should
perform only the necessary labour for the production of
their immaterial product.)</p>
<p class="quote">“The labour which is productive of
immaterial products, <i>like all other labour</i>, is only
productive up to the point at which it increases the
utility, and consequently the value” (that is the
use-value, but Say mistakes the utility for the
exchange-value) “of a product: beyond this point, it
is a purely unproductive labour” (l.c., p. 120).</p>
<p>Say’s logic is therefore this:</p>
<p>It is <i>not so useful</i> for a nation to increase the
“producers of immaterial products” as to
increase the producers of material products. 
<i>Proof:</i> it is absolutely useless to increase the
producers of any kind of product, whether material or
immaterial, beyond what is necessary.  <i>Therefore</i>
it is more useful to increase the useless producers of
material products than those of immaterial products. 
It does not follow in both cases that it is useless to
increase these producers, but only the producers of a
particular kind in their corresponding branch of
production.</p>
<p>[According to Say], too many material products cannot
 <span class="context">||400|</span> be produced, nor can
 too many immaterial.  But a change is diverting. 
 So different kinds must be produced in both
 departments.  And moreover Monsieur Say teaches:
 “Sluggishness in the sale of some products arises
 from the scarcity of some others” (l.c., p. 438).</p>
<p>Therefore there can never be too many tables produced,
but at most perhaps too few dishes to be put on the
tables.  If physicians increase too much in number,
what is wrong is not that their services are available in
superfluity, but perhaps that the services of other
producers of immaterial products are in short
supply—for example, prostitutes (see l. c., p. 123,
where the industries of street-porters, prostitutes, etc.,
are grouped together, and where Say ventures to assert that
the “apprenticeship” for a prostitute
“amounts to nothing”).</p>
<p>In the end, the scales come down on the side of the
“unproductive labourers”.  With given
conditions of production, it is known exactly how many
labourers are needed to make a table, how great the quantity
of a particular kind of labour must be in order to make a
particular product.  With many “immaterial
products” this is not the case.  The quantity of
labour required to achieve a particular result is as
conjectural as the result itself.  Twenty priests
together perhaps bring about the conversion that one fails
to make; six physicians consulting together perhaps discover
the remedy that one alone cannot find, In a bench of judges
perhaps more justice is produced than by a single judge who
has no control but himself.  The number of soldiers
required to protect a country, of police to establish order
in it, of officials “to govern it” well,
etc.  —all these things are problematical and are
very often discussed for example in the English Parliament;
although how much spinning labour is needed to spin 1,000
lbs. of twist is known very exactly in England.  As for
other “productive” labourers of this kind, the
concept of them includes the fact that the utility which
they produce depends only on their number, consists in their
number itself.  For example, lackeys, who should bear
witness to their master’s wealth and elegance.  The
greater the number of them, the greater the effect they are
supposed to “produce”.  Thus Monsieur Say
sticks to his point: “unproductive labourers”
can never be sufficiently increased in numbers.  <span class="context">|400||</span></p>

<h3>[14.]  Count Destutt de Tracy [Vulgar Conception of the
Origin of Profit.  Proclamation of the Industrial
Capitalist” as the Sole Productive Labourer]</h3>
<p><span class="context">||400|</span> Le comte Destutt de
Tracy: <i>Élémments d’idéologie,
IV<sup class="ratio">e</sup> et V<sup class="ratio">e</sup> parties</i>. 
<i>Traité de la volonté et de ses effets</i>,
Paris, 1826 ([First edition] 1815).</p>
<p class="quote">“All useful labour is really
productive, and the whole labouring class of society equally
deserves the name <i>productive</i>” (p. 87).</p>
<p>But in this productive class he distinguishes “the
labouring class which <i>directly produces</i> all our
wealth” (p. 88) —that is, what Smith calls the
productive labourers.</p>
<p>As against these, the <i>sterile</i> class consists of
the rich, who consume their rent of land or rent on
money.  They are the <i>idle class</i>.</p>
<p class="quote">“The real <i>sterile</i> class is the
class of idlers, who do nothing but live what is called
<i>nobly</i> on the products of labours performed before
them, whether these products are realised in landed property
which they farm out, that is to say, which they <i>lease</i>
to a labourer, or whether they consist in money or goods
that they lend for a return, which also means to
<i>lease</i> them.  Those are the real drones of the
hive (<i>fruges consumere nati</i><a href="#_ftn25" id="_ftnref25">*</a>)”
(p. 87): these idlers “can expend nothing but their
<i>revenue</i>.  If they break into their funds <span class="context">||401|</span> , nothing replaces diem; and
their consumption, increased for the moment, ceases for
ever” (p. 237).</p>
<p class="quote">“This <i>revenue</i> is … only
a deduction from the products of activity of the industrious
citizens” (p. 236).</p>
<p>How then does it stand with the labourers whom these
idlers directly employ?  In so far as they consume
commodities, they do not consume actual labour, but the
products of the productive labourers, Here therefore we are
dealing with labourers for whose labour the idlers directly
exchange their revenue, that is, with labourers who draw
their wages directly from revenue, not from capital.</p>
<p class="quote">“Since the men to whom it” (the
revenue) “belongs are idle, it is obvious that they do
<i>not direct any Productive labour</i>.  All these
labourers whom they pay are intended only to procure some
enjoyment for them.  No doubt these enjoyments are of
different kinds…  The expenditure of all this
class of men … feeds a numerous population whose
existence it makes possible, but one whose labour is
completely sterile.  … Some of it may he more or
less fruitful, as for example the construction of a house,
the improvement of e landed estate; but these are particular
cases when for the tine being they cause productive labour
to be performed, Apart from these minor exceptions, the
whole consumption of this species of capitalists is
absolutely pure loss from the standpoint of reproduction,
and an equally great diminution of the wealth that has been
acquired” (p. 236).</p>
<p>&lt;Real political economy <i>à la</i> Smith
treats the capitalist only as personified capital,
M—C—M, agent of production.  But who is to
consume the products?  The labourers?  —but
they don’t.  The capitalist himself?  Then he is
acting as a big idle consumer and not as a capitalist. 
The owners of land and money rents?  They do not
reproduce their consumption, and thereby are of disservice
to wealth, Nevertheless, there are also two correct aspects
in this contradictory view, which regards the capitalist
only as a real amasser of wealth, not an illusory one like
the miser proper: (1) capital (and hence the capitalist, its
personification) is treated only as an agent for the
development of the productive forces and of production; (2)
it expresses the standpoint of emerging capitalist society,
to which what matters is exchange-value, not use-value;
wealth, not enjoyment.  The enjoyment of wealth seems
to it a superfluous luxury, until it itself learns to
combine exploitation and consumption and to subordinate
itself to the enjoyment of wealth.&gt;</p>
<p class="quote">“To find how these revenues”
(on which the Idlers live) “have been formed it is
always necessary to go back to the <i>industrial
capitalists</i>”(p 237, note)</p>
<p>The <i>industrial capitalists</i>—the second sort
of capitalists—</p>
<p class="quote">“include all the entrepreneurs in any
industry whatever, that Is to say, all the persons who,
<i>having capitals</i>, … employ their talent and
their labour in turning them to account themselves instead
of hiring them to others, and who consequently live neither
on wages <i>nor</i> on revenues but on <i>profits</i>”
(p. 237).</p>
<p>In Destutt it is quite clear —as with Adam Smith
before him —that what on the surface is glorification
of the productive labourer is in fact only glorification of
the <i>industrial capitalist</i> in contrast to landlords
and such moneyed capitalists as live only on their
revenue.</p>
<p class="quote">“They have … in their hands
almost all the wealth of society…  It is not
only the income from this wealth that they spend annually,
but even the fund itself, and sometimes many times in the
year, when the course of business is rapid enough to make
this possible.  For since in their capacity as
industrialists they spend only in order that the money shall
come back to them with a pro fit, the more they can do so on
this condition, the greater their profits”
(pp. 237-38).</p>
<p>As for their personal consumption, it is the same as that
of the idle capitalists.  But it is</p>
<p class="quote">“in total moderate, because
industrialists are usually unassuming” (p. 238). 
But it is different with their industrial consumption, it
“is nothing less than final; it returns to them with
profits” (l.c.).  Their profit must be large
enough not only for their “personal consumption, but
also” for “the rents for the land and for the
money which they hold from the idle capitalists”
(p. 238).</p>
<p>Destutt is right on this.  Rents of land and
interest on money are only “<i>deductions</i>”
from industrial profit, portions of the latter given by the
industrial capitalist from his gross profit to landlords and
moneyed capitalists.</p>
<p class="quote">“The revenues of the rich idlers are
only rents taken from industry; it is industry alone that
creates them” (p. 248).  The industrial
capitalists “rent their” (that is, the idle
capitalists’) “land, their houses and their money, and
they make use of them in such a way as to <i>draw
profits</i> from them <i>hi g her than this rent</i>”
[p. 237].  That is, the rent which they pay to the
idlers, which therefore is only a part of this profit. 
This rent that they thus pay to the idlers is “the
sole revenue of these idlers and the sole fund for their
annual expenditures” (p. 238).</p>
<p>Up to here, all right.  But how then does it stand
with the <i>wage-labourers</i> (the productive labourers,
who are employed by the industrial capitalists)?</p>
<p class="quote">“These have no other treasure but
their everyday labour.  This labour obtains wages for
them…  But whence come these wages?  It is
clear that they come from the properties of those to whom
the <span class="context">||402|</span> wage-labourers
<i>sell their labour</i>, that is to say, from the funds
which are in their possession beforehand, and which are
<i>nothing but the accumulated products of labours
previously performed</i>.  It follows from this that
the consumption paid for by this wealth is the consumption
of the wage-labourers, in the sense that it is they whom it
maintains, but at bottom it is <i>not they who pay
it</i>.  Or at least they only pay for it <i>with funds
existing beforehand in the hands of those who employ
them</i>.  Their consumption should therefore be
regarded as having been made by those who hire them. 
They only receive with one hand and return with the
other,.,, It is therefore necessary to regard not only all
that they” (the wage-labourers) “spend but even
all that they receive as the real expenditure and
<i>consumption of those who buy their labour</i>.  That
is so true that in order to see whether this consumption is
more or less destructive of wealth that has been acquired,
or even if it tends to increase it … it is necessary
to know <i>what use the capitalists make of the labour that
they buy</i>” (pp. <i>234-35</i>).</p>
<p>Very well.  And whence come the profits of the
entrepreneurs which enable them to pay revenue to themselves
and to the idle capitalists, etc.?</p>
<p class="quote">“I will be asked how these industrial
entrepreneurs can make such large profits, and whence they
can draw them?  I reply that <i>it is through their
selling everything that they produce at a higher price than
it has cost them to produce</i>” (p. 239).</p>
<p>And to whom do they sell everything at a higher price
than it costs them?</p>
<p class="quote">“They sell it,</p>
<p class="quote">“1.  to themselves, for the
whole part of their consumption destined for the
satisfaction of their needs, which they pay for with a
portion of their profits;</p>
<p class="quote">“2.  to the wage-labourers, both
those whom they pay and those paid by the idle capitalists;
in this way <i>they take beck from these labourers the total
amount of their wages</i>, apart from any small economies
which these may be able to make;</p>
<p class="quote">“3.  to the idle capitalists,
<i>who pay them with the part of their revenue</i> which
they have not already given to the labourers directly
employed by them, so that all the rent which they annually
pay to the idle capitalists comes back to them in one or
other of these ways” (p. 239).</p>
<p>Let us now have a look at these three categories of
sales.</p>
<p>1.  The industrial capitalists themselves consume
<i>one part</i> of their product (or profit).  They
cannot possibly enrich themselves by swindling themselves
and selling their products to themselves at a <i>dearer
price</i> than they themselves have <i>paid</i> for
them.  Nor can any one of them swindle the others in
this way.  If A sells his product, which the industrial
capitalist B consumes, at too dear a price, then B sells his
product, which the industrial capitalist A consumes, at too
dear a price.  It is the same thing as if A and B had
sold their products to each other at their real value. 
Category 1 shows us how the capitalists spend a part of
their profit; it does not show us whence they draw the
profit.  In any case they make no profit by <i>selling
“to one another</i>” “everything that they
produce <i>at a higher price</i> than it has cost to produce
“.</p>
<p>2.  They can likewise draw no profit from the part
of the product which they sell to their labourers <i>above
the costs of production</i>, It is presupposed that the
whole consumption of the labourers is in fact “the
consumption of those who buy their labour “. 
Moreover Destutt rubs this in by remarking that the
capitalists, by selling their products to the wage-labourers
(their own and those of the idle capitalists), only
“get back their total wages ”.  And in fact
not even the total, but after deducting their
economies.  It is all the same whether they sell the
products to them cheap or dear, since they always only get
back what they have given them, and, as said above, the
wage-labourers only “receive with one hand and return
with the other”.  First the capitalist pays
<i>money</i> to the labourer as wages.  Then he sells
him his product “<i>too</i> dear”, and by so
doing draws the money back again.  But as the labourer
cannot pay back to the capitalist more money than he has
received from him, so the capitalist can <i>never</i> sell
his products to him <i>dearer</i> than he has <i>paid</i>
him for his labour.  He can always only get back from
him as much money for the sale of his products as the money
he has given him for his labour.  Not a farthing
more.  How then can his money increase through this
“circulation”?</p>
<p><span class="context">||403|</span> In addition to this,
there is another absurdity in Destutt.  Capitalist C
pays the labourer L a weekly wage of £1, and then
draws back the £1 for himself again by selling him
commodities for £1.  By this means, Tracy thinks,
he has drawn back to himself the total of the wages
paid.  But first he gives the labourer £1. 
And then he gives him commodities for £1.  So
what in fact he has given him is £2: £1 in
commodities and £1 in money.  Of this £2,
he takes back £1 in the form of money.  Therefore
in fact he has not drawn back a farthing of the £1
wage.  And if he intended to enrich himself by this
kind of “drawing back” the wages (instead of by
the labourer giving him back in labour what he advanced to
him in commodities), he would soon come to his senses.</p>
<p>Here, therefore, the noble Destutt confuses the
circulation of money with the real circulation of
commodities.  Because the capitalist, instead of giving
the labourer directly commodities to the value of £1,
gives him £1, with which the labourer then decides as
he likes which commodities he wants to buy, and returns to
the capitalist in the form of money the draft he had given
him on his merchandise—after he, the labourer, has
appropriated his aliquot share of the
merchandise—Destutt imagines that the capitalist
“draws back” the wages, because the same piece
of money flows back to him, And on the same page Monsieur
Destutt remarks that the phenomenon of circulation is
“little known” (p. 239).  Totally unknown
to himself, at any rate.  If Destutt had not explained
“the drawing back of the total wages” in this
peculiar way, the nonsense might at least have been
conceivable in a way we shall mention now.</p>
<p>(But before that, a further illustration of his
sapience.  If I go into a shop and the shopkeeper gives
me £1 and I then use this £1 to buy commodities
to the value of £1 in his shop, he then draws back the
£1 again.  No one will assert that he has
enriched himself by this operation.  Instead of
£1 in money and £1 in commodities he now has
only £1 in money left.  Even if his commodity was
only worth l0s. and he sold it to me for £1, in this
case too he is 10s. poorer than he was before the sale, even
though he has drawn back the whole of one pound
sterling.)</p>
<p>If C, the capitalist, gives the labourer £1 wages,
and afterwards sells him commodities to the value of
10s. for £1, he would certainly have made a profit of
10s. because he had sold the commodities to the labourer
10s. too dear.  But from Monsieur Destutt’s point of
view even so it could not be understood how any profit from
this transaction arises for C.  (The profit arises from
the fact that he has paid him less wages—in fact has
given the labourer a smaller aliquot part of the product in
exchange for his labour—than he gives him
<i>nominally</i>.) If he gave the labourer 10s. and sold his
commodity for <i>10s</i>., he would be just as rich as if he
gives him £1 and sells him his 10s. commodity for
£1.  Moreover, Destutt bases his argument on the
assumption of necessary wages.  In the best case any
profit here would only be explained by the labourer having
been cheated over his wages.</p>
<p>This case 2 therefore shows that Destutt has absolutely
forgotten what a productive labourer is, and has not the
slightest idea of the source of profit.  At most it
could be said that the capitalist makes a profit by raising
the price of the products above their value, in so far as he
sells them not to his own wage-labourers but to the
wage-labourers of idle capitalists.  But since the
consumption of unproductive labourers is in fact only a part
of the consumption of idle capitalists, we come now to case
3.</p>
<p>3.  The industrial capitalist sells his products
“too dear”, above their value, to the</p>
<p class="quote">“idle capitalists, who pay them with
the part of their revenue which they have not already given
to the labourers directly employed by them, so that all the
rent which they annually pay to the idle capitalists comes
back to them” (the industrial capitalists) “in
one or other of these ways”.</p>
<p>Here again there is the childish conception of the rent,
etc., coming back, as there was above of the drawing back of
the whole of the wages.  For example, C pays £100
rent for land and money to I (the idle capitalist). 
The £100 are means of payment for C.  They are
means of purchase for I, who with them draws £100 of
commodities from C’s warehouse.  Thus the £100
return to C as the transformed form of his commodity. 
But he has £100 less in commodities than before. 
Instead of giving them direct to I, he has given him
£100 in money, with which the latter buys £100
of his commodities.  But he buys these £100 worth
of commodities with C’s money, not with his own funds. 
And Tracy imagines that in this way the rent which C has
paid over to I comes back to C.  What imbecility! 
First absurdity.</p>
<p>Secondly, Destutt himself has told us that rent of land
and interest on money are only deductions from the
industrial capitalist’s profit, and therefore only quotas of
profit given away to the idler.  On the assumption that
C drew back this whole quota <span class="context">||404|</span> to himself by some sort of
trick, though not in one or other of the ways described by
Tracy —in other words, that capitalist C paid no rent
at all, neither to the landlord nor to the moneyed
capitalist—lie would retain his <i>whole</i> profit,
but the question is precisely how to explain <i>whence</i>
he derived the profit, how he has made it, how it
arose.  As this cannot be explained by his <i>having or
retaining</i> it without giving a quota of it to landlord
and moneyed capitalist, just as little can it be explained
by the fact that either part or the whole of the quota of
profit which he has given away to the idler under one
category or another is entirely or partially, in one way or
another, dragged back by him from the hand of the idler into
his own hand again.  Second absurdity!</p>
<p>Let us disregard these absurdities.  C has to pay I
—the idler—rent to the amount of £100 for
the land or the capital that he has rented (loué)
from him.  He pays the £100 out of his profit
(whence the latter arises we do not yet know).  Then he
sells his products to I, which are consumed either by I
directly or through his retainers (the unproductive
wage-labourers), and he sells them to him <i>too dear</i>,
for example, 25 per cent above their value.  He sells
him products worth £80 for £100.  In this
transaction C undoubtedly makes a profit of £20. 
He has given I a draft for £100 worth of
commodities.  When the latter presents the draft, he
gives his commodities only to the value of £80, by
fixing the nominal price of his goods 25 per cent above
their value.  Even if I would be satisfied with
consuming commodities worth £80 and paying £100
for them, C’s profit could never rise above 25 per
cent.  The prices and the fraud would be repeated every
year.  But I wants to consume to the value of
£100.  If he is a landlord, what is he to
do?  He mortgages property to C for £25, in
exchange for which C gives him commodities worth
£20—for he sells his commodities at 25 per cent
(one-quarter) above their value, If he is a money-lender, he
hands over to C £25 of his capital, in exchange for
which C gives him commodities worth £20.</p>
<p>Let us assume that the capital (or value of the land) was
lent at 5 per cent.  Then it amounted to
£2,000.  Now it amounts to only
£1,975.  His rents are now £98
<sup class="ratio">3</sup>/<sub class="ratio">4</sub>.  And so it would go on, with
I constantly consuming commodities to the real value of
£100, but his rents constantly falling, because in
order to have commodities to the value of £100 he must
always consume an ever greater part of his capital
itself.  Thus bit by bit C would get the whole of I’s
capital into his own hands, and the rents of it together
with the capital—that is to say, along with the
capital itself he would appropriate that portion of the
profit which he makes from borrowed capital. 
Mr. Destutt evidently has this process in view, for he
continues:</p>
<p class="quote">“But, I will he told, if that is so
and if industrial entrepreneurs in effect <i>reap each year
more than they have sown</i>, in a very short time they must
have attracted to themselves <i>the whole public
fortune</i>, and soon there would be nothing left in a State
but labourers without funds and capitalist
entrepreneurs.  <i>That is true</i>, and things would
in fact be so if the entrepreneurs or their heirs did not
take the course of resting as they grow wealthy, and did not
thus continually go to recruit the class of idle
capitalists; and even in spite of this frequent emigration,
it still happens that when industry has been at work in a
country for some time without too great disturbances, its
capitals are always being augmented not only because of the
growth of the total wealth, but also in a much greater
proportion…  It might be added this effect would he
felt even more strongly but for the immense levies that all
governments impose each year on the industrious class by
means of taxes    (pp. 240-41),</p>
<p>And Monsieur Destutt is quite right up to a certain
point, although not at all in what he wants to
explain.  In the period of the declining Middle Ages
and rising capitalist production the rapid enrichment of the
industrial capitalists is in part to be explained by the
direct fleecing of the landlords.  As the value of
money fell, as a result of the discoveries in America, the
farmers paid them nominally, but not really, the old rent,
while the manufacturers sold them commodities above their
value —not only on the basis of the higher value of
money.  Similarly in all countries, as for example the
Asiatic, where the principal revenue of the country is in
the hands of landlords, princes, etc., in the form of rent,
the manufacturers, <i>few in number</i> and therefore not
restricted by competition, sell them their commodities at
monopoly prices, and in this way appropriate a part of their
revenue; they enrich themselves <span class="context">||405|</span> not only by selling to them
“unpaid” labour, but by selling the commodities
at over the quantity of labour contained in them.  Only
Monsieur Destutt is again wrong if he believes that
money-lenders let themselves be fleeced in this way. 
On the contrary, they share, through the high interest they
draw, in those high profits, in that fleecing, directly and
indirectly.</p>
<p>The following passage shows that this phenomenon was in
Monsieur Destutt’s mind:</p>
<p class="quote">“One has only to see how weak
they” (the industrial capitalists) “were
throughout all Europe three or four centuries ago, in
comparison with the immense wealth of all the powerful men
of those days, and how today they have increased and grown
in number, while the others have diminished” (l.c., p.
241).</p>
<p>What Monsieur Destutt wanted to explain to us was the
<i>profits</i> and the <i>high profits</i> of industrial
capital.  He has explained it in two ways.  First,
because the <i>money</i> which these capitalists pay out in
the form of wages and rents flows back to them again, since
these wages and rents buy products from them.  In fact,
what this explains is only why they do not pay wages and
rents <i>twice</i>, first in the form of money, and secondly
in the form of commodities to the same amount in
money.  The second explanation is that they sell their
commodities above their price, they sell them <i>too
dear</i>, first to <i>themselves</i>, thus cheating
themselves; secondly to the labourers, thus again cheating
themselves, as Monsieur Destutt tells us that the
consumption of the wage-labourers “must be regarded as
the consumption of those who pay them” (p. 235);
finally, in the third place, to the <i>gentlemen living on
rents</i>, whom they fleece, and this would in fact explain
why the industrial capitalists always keep for themselves a
larger part of their profit, instead of giving it away to
the idlers.  It would show why <i>the distribution of
the total profit</i> between the industrial and
non-industrial capitalists is increasingly to the advantage
of the former at the cost of the latter.  It would not
help one iota to an understanding <i>of whence</i> this
<i>total profit</i> comes.  Let us assume that the
industrial capitalists had got the whole of it for
themselves, the question remains where does it come
from?</p>
<p>Therefore Destutt has not only given no answer, but he
has only revealed that he thinks the reflux of the money is
a reflux of the commodity itself.  This <i>reflux of
money</i> means only that the capitalists first pay wages
and rents in money, instead of paying them in commodities;
that their commodities are bought with this money and hence
they have paid in commodities in this roundabout way. 
This money therefore constantly flows back to them, but only
to the extent that commodities to the same money value are
definitively taken from them and fall to the share of the
consumption of the wage-labourers and drawers of rent.</p>
<p>Monsieur Destutt (in a really French way—similar
exclamations of astonishment about himself are to be found
in Proudhon) is altogether astonished at the
“clarity” which this</p>
<p class="quote">“way of looking at the consumption of
our wealth…sheds on the whole progress of society. 
Whence comes this consistency and this lucidity?  From
the fact that we have lighted upon the truth.  This
recalls the effect of those mirrors in which objects are
outlined clearly and in their right proportions when one is
in the right spot from which to view them, and in which
everything appears confused and disjointed when one is too
near or too far” (pp.242-43).</p>
<p>Later, quite incidentally, Monsieur Destutt recalls (from
Adam Smith) the real course of things, which however in
essence he only repeats as a phrase which he has not
understood—as otherwise he (this Member of the
Institute of France) would have been unable to shed the
streams of light referred to above.  Destutt writes
(p. 246):</p>
<p class="quote">“Whence come their revenues to these
idle men?  Is it not from the rent which those who
<i>set their capitals to work</i> pay to them out of their
<i>profits</i>, that is to say, those who use their funds
<i>to pay labour which produces more than it costs</i>, in a
word, the men of industry? ”</p>
<p>&lt;Aha!  So the rents (and also their own profits)
which the industrial capitalists pay to the idle capitalists
for the funds borrowed from the latter come from their using
these funds to pay wages to labour “which <i>produces
more than it costs”;</i> that is to say, therefore,
whose product has more value than is paid <i>to</i> them
—in other words, profit comes from what the
wage-labourers produce over and above what they cost; a
surplus-product which the industrial capitalist appropriates
for himself, and of which he gives away only one part to
those receiving rent from land and money.&gt;</p>
<p>Monsieur Destutt concludes from this: not that we must go
back to these productive labourers, but that we must go back
to the capitalists who set them in motion.</p>
<p class="quote">“It is these who really maintain even
the labourers employed by the others” (p. 246).</p>
<p>To be sure; inasmuch as they directly exploit labour, and
the idle capitalists only do it through their agency. 
And in this sense it is correct to regard industrial capital
as the source of wealth.  <span class="context">||406|</span></p>
<p class="quote">“We must therefore always go back to
these” (the industrial capitalists) “in order to
find the source of all wealth” (p. 246).</p>
<p class="quote">“In the coarse of time, <i>wealth has
accumulated in greater or less quantity, because the result
of previous labours has not been entirely consumed as soon
as produced</i>.  Some of the possessors of this wealth
are content to draw a rent from it and consume it. 
These are those whom we have called idle.  The other
more active ones set to work both their own funds and those
which they borrow.  They employ them <i>to pay labour
which reproduces them with</i> a <i>profit.”&lt;</i>
Hence, therefore, not only the reproduction of this fund,
but [the production ] of the surplus, which forms
<i>profit</i>.&gt; “With this profit they pay for
their own consumption and defray that of others.  By
these consumptions themselves” (their own and that of
the idlers?  Here again the same absurdity)
“their funds come back to them somewhat increased, and
they start again.  That is what constitutes
circulation” (pp. 246-47).</p>
<p>The inquiry into the “productive labourer”,
and the result that only one whose buyer is an industrial
capitalist is a productive labourer—one whose labour
produces profit for its immediate buyer—led Monsieur
Destutt to the conclusion that in fact <i>the industrial
capitalists</i> are the <i>sole productive labourers</i> in
the higher meaning of the word.</p>
<p class="quote">“They” (the industrial
capitalists) “who live on profits maintain all the
others and alone augment the public fortune and create all
our means of enjoyment.  That must be so, b<i>ecause
labour is the source of oil wealth</i> and because they
alone give a <i>useful direction to current labour</i>, by
making a <i>useful application of accumulated
labour</i>” (p. 242).</p>
<p>That they give “a useful direction to current
labour” in fact means only that they employ useful
labour, labour which results in use-values.  But that
they make “useful application of accumulated
labour” —if it is not to mean the same thing
again, that they make industrial use of accumulated wealth
for the production of use-values —means that they make
“useful application of accumulated labour” by
buying with it more current labour than is contained in
it.  In the passage just cited Destutt naïvely
epitomises the contradictions which make up the essence of
capitalist production.  Because labour is the source of
all wealth, capital is the source of all wealth; the actual
propagator of wealth is not he who labours, but he who makes
a profit out of another’s labour.  The productive
powers of labour are the productive powers of capital.</p>
<p class="quote">“Our faculties are our only original
wealth; our labour produces all other wealth, and all
labour, properly directed, is productive”
(p. 243).</p>
<p>Hence, according to Destutt, it follows as a matter of
course that the industrial capitalists “maintain all
the others and alone augment the public fortune and create
all our means of enjoyment”.</p>
<p>Our faculties (<i>facultés</i>) are our only
original wealth, therefore the faculty of labour is not
wealth.  Labour produces all other wealth, that means:
it produces wealth for all others except for itself, and it
itself is not wealth, but only its product is wealth. 
All properly directed labour is productive; that means: all
productive labour, all labour which yields profit to the
capitalist, is properly directed.</p>
<p>The following remarks of Destutt —which refer not
to the <i>different classes of consumers</i>, but to the
<i>different nature of the articles of consumption
—are</i> a very good paraphrase of Adam Smith’s views
in Book II, Chapter III, at the end of which he inquires
into what kind of (unproductive) expenditure, that is to
say, of individual consumption, consumption of revenue, is
more or less advantageous.  He opens this inquiry
(Garnier, t. II, p. 345) with the words:</p>
<p class="quote">“As frugality increases, and
prodigality diminishes, the public capital, so the conduct
of those whose expense just equals their revenue, without
either accumulating or encroaching, neither increases nor
diminishes it.  Some modes of expense, however, seem to
contribute more to the growth of public opulence than
others” [<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, O.U.P, edition,
Vol. I, pp. 387-88].</p>
<p>Destutt summarises Smith’s exposition as follows:</p>
<p class="quote">“If consumption is very different
according to the kind of consumer, it varies also according
to the nature of the things consumed.  All indeed
represent labour, but its value is fixed more securely in
some than in others.  As much trouble may have been
taken in making a firework as in finding and cutting a
diamond, and consequently one may have as much value as the
other.  But when I have bought, paid for and used both,
at the end of half an hour I shall have nothing left of the
first, and the second can still be a resource for my
grandchildren a century later..,, It is the same with what
||4O7| are called” that is, (by Say) “immaterial
products.  <i>An invention is of eternal
utility</i>.  An intellectual work, a picture also have
a utility that is more or less durable, while that of a
ball, a concert, a play is instantaneous and disappears
immediately.  The same can be said of the <i>personal
services</i> of doctors, lawyers, soldiers, domestic
servants, and in general of all who are called <i>employed
persons</i>.  Their utility is that of the moment of
need…  The most ruinous consumption is the
quickest, because it is that which destroys more labour in
the same time, or an equal quantity of labour in less time;
in comparison with it, consumption which is slower is a kind
of <i>treasuring up</i>, since it leaves to times to come
the enjoyment of part of the present
sacrifices…  Everyone knows that it is more
economical to get, <i>for the same price</i>, a coat that
will last three years than a similar one which will only
last three months” (pp. 243-44).</p>

<h3>[15.  General Nature of the Polemics against Smith’s
Distinction between Productive and Unproductive
Labour.  Apologetic Conception of Unproductive
Consumption as a Necessary Spur to Production]</h3>
<p>Most of the writers who contested Smith’s view of
productive and unproductive labour regard <i>consumption</i>
as a necessary spur to production.  <i>For this
reason</i> they regard the <i>wage-labourers</i> who live on
revenue—the unproductive labourers whose hire does not
produce wealth, but is itself a new consumption of
wealth—as equally productive <i>even of material
wealth</i> as the productive labourers, since they widen the
field of material consumption and therewith the field of
production.  This was therefore for the most part
apologetics from the standpoint of bourgeois economy, partly
for the rich idlers and the “unproductive
labourers” whose <i>services</i> they consume, partly
for “strong governments” whose expenditure is
heavy, for the increase of the State debts, for holders of
church and State benefices, holders of sinecures, etc. 
For these “unproductive labourers”—whose
services figure in the expenses of the idle rich—all
have in common the fact that although they <i>produce
“immaterial products</i>”, they consume
“<i>material products</i>”, that is, products of
the productive labourers.</p>
<p>Other economists, like Malthus, admit the distinction
between productive labourers and unproductive, but prove to
the industrial capitalist that the latter are as necessary
to him as the former, even for the production of material
wealth.</p>
<p>To say that production and consumption are identical or
that consumption is the purpose of all production or that
production is the pre-condition of all consumption, is of no
help in this connection.  What—apart from the
tendentious purpose—is at the bottom of the whole
dispute is rather this:</p>
<p>The labourer’s consumption on the average is only equal
to his costs of production, it is not equal to his
output.  He therefore produces the whole surplus for
others, and so this whole part of his <i>production</i> is
<i>production for others</i>.  Moreover, the industrial
capitalist who drives the labourer to this
<i>overproduction</i> (that is, production over and above
his own subsistence needs) and makes use of all expedients
to increase it to the greatest extent possible—to
increase this relative <i>overproduction</i> as distinct
from the necessary production—directly appropriates
the surplus-product for himself.  But as personified
capital he produces for the sake of production, he wants to
accumulate wealth for the sake of the accumulation of
wealth.  In so far as he is a mere functionary of
capital, that is, an agent of capitalist production, what
matters to him is exchange-value and the increase of
exchange-value, not use-value and its increase.  What
he is concerned with is the increase of abstract wealth, the
rising appropriation of the labour of others.  He is
dominated by the same absolute drive to enrich himself as
the miser, except that he does not satisfy it in the
illusory form of building up a treasure of gold and silver,
but in the creation of capital, which is real
production.  If the labourer’s overproduction is
<i>production for others</i>, the production of the normal
capitalist, of the industrial capitalist as he ought to be,
is <i>production for the sake of production</i>.  It is
true that the more his wealth grows, the more he falls
behind this ideal, and becomes extravagant, even if only to
show off his wealth.  But he is always enjoying wealth
with a guilty conscience, with frugality and thrift at the
back of his mind.  In spite of all his prodigality he
remains, like the miser, essentially avaricious.</p>
<p>When Sismondi says that the development of the productive
powers of labour makes it possible for the labourer to
obtain ever-increasing enjoyments, but that these very
enjoyments, if put at his disposal, would make him unfit for
labour (as a wagelabourer)<a href="#_ftn26" id="_ftnref26">*</a>; it is equally true that the
industrial capitalist becomes more or less unable to fulfill
his function as soon as he personifies the enjoyment of
wealth, as soon as he wants the accumulation of pleasures
instead of the pleasure of accumulation.</p>
<p>He is therefore also a producer of <i>overproduction,
production for others</i>.  Over against this
overproduction on one side must be placed overconsumption on
the other, production for the sake of production must be
confronted by consumption for the sake of consumption. 
What the industrial capitalist has to surrender to
landlords, the State, creditors of the State, the church,
and so forth, who only consume revenue, <span class="context">||408|</span> is an absolute diminution of
his wealth, but it keeps his lust for enrichment going and
thus preserves his capitalist soul.  If the landlords,
moneylenders, etc., were to consume their revenue also in
productive instead of unproductive labour, the purpose would
not be achieved.  They would become themselves
industrial capitalists, instead of representing the function
of consumption as such.  With regard to this point we
shall examine later an extremely comical dispute between a
Ricardian and a Malthusian.</p>
<p>Production and consumption are <i>in their nature</i>
[<i>an sich</i>] inseparable.  From this it follows
that since in the system of capitalist production they are
in fact separated, their unity is restored through their
opposition—that if A must produce for B, B must
consume for A.  Just as we find with every individual
capitalist that he favours prodigality on the part of those
who are co-partners with him in his revenue, so the older
Mercantile system as a whole depends on the idea that a
nation must be frugal as regards itself, but must produce
luxuries for foreign nations to enjoy.  The idea here
is always: on the one side, production for production,
therefore on the other side consumption of foreign
production.  This idea of the Mercantile system is
expressed for example by Dr. Paley, <i>Moral Philosophy</i>,
Vol.  II, Ch.XI:</p>
<p class="quote">“… A laborious, frugal people,
ministering to the demands of an opulent, luxurious
nation.” [W. Paley, <i>Principles of Moral and
Political Phylosophy</i>, Edinburgh, 1788, Vol. II,
p. 359.]</p>
<p class="quote">“They” (our politicians,
Garnier, etc.)  says Destutt, “put forward as a
general principle that consumption is the cause of
production, that therefore it is good for it to be very
plentiful.  They declare that it is this which
constitutes a great difference between public economy and
the economy of individuals” (l.c., pp. 249-50).</p>
<p>One more fine phrase:</p>
<p class="quote">“<i>The poor nations</i> are those
where the people are comfortably off; and <i>the rich
nations</i>, those where the people are generally
poor” (l.c., p. 231).</p>

<h3>[16.]  Henri Storch [Unhistorical Approach to the
Problem of the Interaction between Material and Spiritual
Production.  Conception of “Immaterial
Labour” Performed by the Ruling Class]</h3>
<p>Henri Storch, <i>Cours d’économie politique</i>,
etc., edited by Jean— Baptiste Say, Paris, 1823
(Lectures read to Grand Duke Nicholas, concluded in 1815),
<i>Vol. III</i>.</p>
<p>After Garnier, Storch is in fact the first writer to
polemise against Adam Smith’s distinction between productive
and unproductive labour on a new basis.</p>
<p class="quote">He distinguishes the “<i>internal
goods</i> or the elements of civilisation”, with the
laws of whose production the “Theory of
Civilisation” has to concern itself, from material
goods, component parts of material production (l.c., t. III,
p. 217).</p>
<p>(On p age 136 of t. I [he says]: “It is evident
that man only attains to the production of wealth in so far
as he is endowed with internal goods, that is to say, in so
far as he has developed his physical, intellectual and moral
faculties, which implies the means for their development
such as <i>social institutions</i>, etc.  Thus the more
civilised a people, the more its national wealth can
grow.” The reverse is also true.)</p>
<p>Against Smith:</p>
<p class="quote">“Smith…excludes from <i>productive
labours</i> all those which do not contribute
<i>directly</i> to the production of wealth: but also he
only considers the national <i>wealth</i>.” His error
is “not to have distinguished <i>immaterial</i> values
from <i>wealth</i>” (t. III, p. 218).</p>
<p>And that is really all there is to it.  The
distinction between productive labours and unproductive
labours is of decisive importance for what Smith was
considering: the production of material wealth, and in fact
one definite form of that production, the capitalist mode of
production.  In spiritual production another kind of
labour appears as productive.  But Smith does not take
it into consideration.  Finally, the interaction and
the inner connection between the two kinds of production
also do not fall within the field be is considering;
moreover, they can only lead to something more than empty
phrases when material production is examined in its own
form.  In so far as he speaks of workers who are not
directly productive, this is only to the extent that they
participate <i>directly</i> in the consumption of material
wealth but not in its production<a id="art">.</a></p>
<p>With Storch himself the <i>theory of civilisation</i>
does not get beyond trivial phrases, although some ingenious
observations slip in here and there—for example, that
the material division of labour is the pre-condition for the
division of intellectual labour.  How much it <i>was
inevitable</i> that Storch could not get beyond trivial
phrases, how little he had even <i>formulated</i> for
himself the task, let alone its solution, is apparent from
one <i>single</i> circumstance.  In order to examine
the connection between spiritual <span class="context">||409|</span> production and material
production it is above all necessary to grasp the latter
itself not as a general category but in <i>definite
historical</i> form.  Thus for example different kinds
of spiritual production correspond to the capitalist mode of
production and to the mode of production of the Middle
Ages.  If material production itself is not conceived
in its <i>specific historical</i> form, it is impossible to
understand what is specific in the spiritual production
corresponding to it and the reciprocal influence of one on
the other.  Otherwise one cannot get beyond
inanities.  This because of the talk about
“civilisation”.</p>
<p>Further: from the specific form of material production
arises in the first place a specific structure of society,
in the second place a specific relation of men to
nature.  Their State and their spiritual outlook is
determined by both.  Therefore also the kind of their
spiritual production.</p>
<p><i>Finally</i>, by spiritual production Storch means also
all kinds of professional activities of the ruling class,
who carry out social functions as a trade.  The
existence of these strata, like the function they perform,
can only be understood from the specific historical
structure of their production relations.</p>
<p>Because Storch does not conceive material production
itself <i>historically</i>—because he conceives it as
production of material goods in general, not as a definite
historically developed and specific form of this
production—he deprives himself of the basis on which
alone can be understood partly the ideological component
parts of the ruling class, partly the free spiritual
production of this particular social formation.  He
cannot get beyond meaningless general phrases. 
Consequently, the relation is not so simple as he
presupposes.  For instance, capitalist production is
hostile to certain branches of spiritual production, for
example, art and poetry.  If this is left out of
account, it opens the way to the illusion of the French in
the eighteenth century which has been so beautifully
satirised by Lessing.  Because we are further ahead
than the ancients in mechanics, etc., why shouldn’t we be
able to make an epic too?  And the <i>Henriade</i> in
place of the <i>Iliad!</i></p>
<p>Storch, however, rightly stresses—with special
reference to Garnier, who was actually the father of
<i>this</i> attack on Smith —that Smith’s opponents
had set about it the wrong way.</p>
<p class="quote">“What do his critics do?  Far
from establishing this distinction” (between
immaterial values and wealth), “they succeed in
confusing two kinds of value that are so evidently
different.”</p>
<p>(They assert that the production of spiritual products or
the production of services is <i>material</i>
production.)</p>
<p class="quote">“In regarding immaterial labour as
<i>productive</i>, they assume it is <i>productive of
wealth</i>” (that is, directly), “that is to
say, of material and exchangeable values, while it produces
only immaterial and immediate values: they assume that the
products of immaterial labour are subject to the same laws
as those of material labour: and yet the former are governed
by other principles than the latter” (t, III,
p. 218).</p>
<p>The following passages from Storch are to be noted as
having been copied from him by later authors:</p>
<p class="quote">“From the fact that internal goods
are in part the product of services.  the conclusion
has been drawn that they are no more lasting than the
services themselves, and that they were necessarily consumed
as they were produced” (l.c., t. III, p. 234). 
“The original” [internal] “goods, far from
being destroyed by the use made of them, expand and grow
with use, so that even the <i>consumption</i> of them
augments their value” (l.c., p. 236). 
“Internal goods are susceptible of being accumulated
like wealth, and of forming capitals that can be used in
reproduction”, etc. (l.c., p. 236). 
“Material labour must be divided up and its products
must be accumulated before the dividing up of immaterial
labour can be thought of” (p. 241).</p>
<p>These are nothing but general superficial analogies and
relations between spiritual and material wealth. 
So for example is his observation that undeveloped
nations <i>borrow</i> their spiritual capitals from abroad,
just as materially undeveloped nations borrow their material
capitals (l.c., p. 306); and that the division of immaterial
labour depends on the demand for it, in a word, on the
market, etc. (p. 246).</p>
<p>Here are the passages which have actually been
copied:</p>
<p class="quote"><span class="context">||410|</span> “The
<i>production</i> of internal goods, far from diminishing
the national wealth by the consumption of material products
it requires, is on the contrary a powerful means of
increasing it; as the production of wealth, in its turn, is
an equally powerful means of increasing civilisation”
(l.c., p. 517).  “It is the equilibrium of the
two kinds of production that causes the advance of national
prosperity” (l.c., p. 521).</p>
<p>According to Storch, the physician produces health (but
also illness), professors and writers produce enlightenment
(but also obscurantism), poets, painters, etc., produce good
taste (but also had taste), moralists, etc., produce morals,
preachers religion, the sovereign’s labour security, and so
on (pp. 347-50).  It can just as well be said that
illness produces physicians, stupidity produces professors
and writers, lack of taste poets and painters, immorality
moralists, superstition preachers and general insecurity
produces the sovereign.  This way of saying in fact
that all these activities, these services, produce a real or
imaginary use-value is repeated by later writers in order to
prove that they are productive workers in Smith’s sense,
that is to say, that they directly produce not products
<i>suigeneris</i><a href="#_ftn27" id="_ftnref27">*</a>
but products of material labour and consequently immediate
wealth.  In Storch there is not yet this nonsense,
which for that matter can be reduced to the following:</p>
<p>1.  that the various functions in bourgeois society
mutually presuppose each other;</p>
<p>2.  that the contradictions in material production
make necessary a superstructure of ideological strata, whose
activity— whether good or bad—is good, because
it is necessary;</p>
<p>3.  that all functions are in the service of the
capitalist, and work out to his “benefit”;</p>
<p>4.  that even the most sublime spiritual productions
should merely be granted recognition, and <i>apologies</i>
for them made to the bourgeoisie, that they are presented
as, and falsely proved to be, direct producers of material
wealth.</p>

<h3>[17.]  Nassau Senior [Proclamation of All Functions
Useful to the Bourgeoisie as Productive.  Toadyism to
the Bourgeoisie and the Bourgeois State]</h3>
<p>Nassau William Senior, <i>Principes</i><i> fondamentaux
de 1’</i><i>économie politique</i>, traduit par Jean
Arrivabene, Paris, 1836.  Nassau Senior mounts his high
horse:</p>
<p class="quote">“According to Smith, the lawgiver of
the Hebrews was an unproductive labourer” (l.c.,
p. 198).</p>
<p>Was it Moses of Egypt or Moses Mendelssohn?  Moses
would have been very grateful to Mr. Senior for calling him
a “productive labourer” in the Smithian
sense.  These people are so dominated by their fixed
bourgeois ideas that they would think they were insulting
Aristotle or Julius Caesar if they called them
“unproductive labourers”.  Aristotle and
Caesar would have regarded even the title
“labourers” as an insult.</p>
<p class="quote">“Does not the doctor who, by a
prescription, heals a sick child and thus assures him many
years of life, <i>produce</i> a durable result?”
(l.c.)</p>
<p>Rubbish!  If the child dies, the result is no less
durable.  And if the child is no better after
treatment, the doctor’s <i>service</i> has to be paid for
just the same.  According to Nassau doctors should only
be paid in so far as they cure, and lawyers in so far as
they win lawsuits, and soldiers in so far as they are
victorious.  But now he gets really lofty:</p>
<p class="quote">“Did the Dutch produce temporary
results by fighting against the tyranny of the Spaniards, or
the English by revolting against a tyranny that threatened
to be even more terrible?” (l.c., p. 198).</p>
<p>Belletristic trash!  Dutch and English revolted at
their own cost.  No one paid them for labouring
“in revolution”.  But with either
productive or unproductive labourers there is always a buyer
and seller of labour.  Hence what rubbish!</p>
<p>These insipid literary flourishes used by these fellows
when they polemise against Smith show only that they are
representatives of the “educated capitalist”,
while Smith was the <i>interpreter</i> of the frankly brutal
bourgeois upstart.  The educated bourgeois and his
mouthpiece are both so stupid that they measure the effect
of every activity by its <span class="context">||411|</span>
effect on the purse.  On the other hand, they are so
educated that they <i>grant recognition</i> even to
functions and activities that have nothing to do with the
production of wealth; and indeed they grant them recognition
because they too “indirectly” increase, etc.,
their wealth, in a word, fulfill a “useful”
function for wealth.</p>
<p>Man himself is the basis of his material production, as
of any other production that he carries on.  All
circumstances, therefore, which affect man, the <i>subject</i>
of production, more or less modify all his functions and
activities, and therefore too his functions and activities
as the creator of material wealth, of commodities.  In
this respect it can in fact be shown that <i>all</i> human
relations and functions, however and in whatever form they
may appear, influence material production and have a more or
less decisive influence on it.</p>
<p class="quote">“There are countries where it is
quite impossible for people to work the land unless there
are soldiers to protect them.  Well, according to
Smith’s classification, the harvest is not produced by the
joint labour of the man who guides the plough and of the man
at his side with arms in hand: according to him, the
ploughman alone is a productive worker, and the soldier’s
activity is unproductive” (l.c., p. 202).</p>
<p>First, that is not true.  Smith would say that the
soldier’s protective care is productive of defence, but not
of the corn.  If order was restored in the country, the
ploughman would produce the corn just as before, without
being compelled to produce the maintenance, and therefore
the life, of the soldiers into the bargain.  The
soldier belongs to the incidental expenses of production, in
the same way as a large part of the unproductive labourers
who produce nothing themselves, either spiritual or
material, but who are useful and necessary only because of
the faulty social relations—they owe their existence
to social evils.</p>
<p>However, Nassau might say: if a machine is invented that
makes nineteen out of twenty labourers superfluous, then
these nineteen too are incidental expenses of
production.  But the soldier can drop out although the
<i>material conditions of production</i>, the conditions of
agriculture as such, remain unchanged.  The nineteen
labourers can only drop out if the labour of the one
remaining labourer becomes twenty times more productive,
that is to say, only through a revolution in the actual
material conditions of production.  Moreover,
<i>Buchanan</i> already observes:</p>
<p class="quote">“If the soldier, for example, be
termed a productive labourer because his labour is
subservient to production, the productive labourer might, by
the same rule, lay claim to military honours; as it is
certain that without his assistance no army could ever take
the field to fight battles or to gain victories”
(David Buchanan, <i>Observations on the Subjects Treated of
in Dr. Smith’s Inquiry, etc.</i>, Edinburgh, 1814,
p. 132).</p>
<p class="quote">“The wealth of a nation does not
depend on a numerical proportion between those who produce
<i>services</i> and those who produce <i>values</i>, but on
the proportion between them that is most fitted to render
the labour of each more efficacious” (Senior, l.c.,
p. 204).</p>
<p>Smith never denied this, as he wants to reduce the
“necessary unproductive labourers like State
officials, lawyers, priests, etc., to the <i>extent</i> in
which their services are indispensable.  And this is in
any case the “proportion” in which they make the
labour of productive labourers most efficacious.  As
for the other “unproductive labourers”, whose
labours are only bought <i>voluntarily</i> by anyone in
order to enjoy their <i>services</i>, that is, as an article
of consumption of his own choice, different cases must be
distinguished.  If the number of these labourers
living on revenue is large in proportion to the
“productive” labourers, it is, <i>either</i>,
because the total wealth is small or is of a one-sided
character—for example the medieval barons with their
retainers.  Instead of consuming manufactured goods on
any considerable scale, they and their retainers consumed
their agricultural products.  When instead of these
products they began to consume manufactured goods, the
retainers had to be set to labour.  The number of those
living on revenue was only large because a large part of the
annual product was not <i>reproductively</i> consumed. 
Along with this, the total population was small. 
<i>Or</i>, the number of those living on revenue is large,
because the productivity of the productive labourers is
large, and therefore their surplus-produce upon which the
retainers feed.  In this case the labour of the
productive labourers is not productive because there are so
many retainers, but on the contrary—there are so many
retainers because the labour of the productive labourers is
so productive.</p>
<p>Taking two countries with equal populations and an equal
development of the productive powers of labour, it would
always be true to say, with Adam Smith, that the wealth of
the two countries must be measured according to the
proportion of productive and of unproductive
labourers.  For that means only that in the country
which has a relatively greater number of productive
labourers, a relatively greater amount of the annual revenue
is reproductively consumed, and consequently a greater mass
of values is produced annually.  Therefore Mr. Senior
has only paraphrased a statement of <span class="context">||412|</span> Adam’s, instead of
counterposing it with a novelty.  Moreover, he himself
here makes the distinction between the producers of services
and the producers of values, and so it is the same with him
as with most of those who polemise against the Smithian
distinction —they accept and themselves use this
distinction, at the same time as they reject it.</p>
<p>It is characteristic that all “unproductive”
economists, who achieve nothing in their own speciality,
[come out] against the distinction between productive labour
and unproductive labour.  However, in relation to the
bourgeois, it is on the one hand an expression of their
servility that they present all functions as serving the
production of wealth for him; then on the other hand, they
present the bourgeois world as the best of all possible
worlds, in which everything is useful, and the bourgeois
himself is so educated that he understands this.</p>
<p>In relation to the labourers, [what it expresses is:] it
is quite all right that the unproductive ones consume the
great mass [of products], since they contribute just as much
as the labourers to the production of wealth even though in
their own way.</p>
<p>Finally however Nassau blurts out, showing that he has
not understood one word of the essential distinction made by
Smith:</p>
<p class="quote">“It seems, in truth, that in this
case Smith’s attention was entirely absorbed by the position
of the <i>great landowners</i>, the only ones to whom his
observations on the unproductive classes can in general be
applied.  I do not know how otherwise to account for
his supposition <i>that capital is only employed to maintain
productive labourers, while unproductive labourers live from
revenue</i>, The greater number of those whom be calls
preeminently unproductive—teachers, and those who
govern the State—are maintained <i>at the expense of
capital</i>, that is to say, <i>by means of what is spent in
advance for reproduction</i>” (l.c., pp. 204-05).</p>
<p>This, in fact, is past all understanding. 
Mr. Nassau’s discovery that State and schoolmasters live at
the cost of capital and not at the cost of revenue needs no
further commentary.  Does Mr. Senior mean by it that
they live on profit from capital, and in this sense at the
expense of capital?  If so, he only forgets that
revenue from capital is not capital itself, and that this
revenue, the result of capitalist production, is not spent
in advance for reproduction, of which on the contrary it is
the result.  Or does he mean that it is so because
certain taxes enter into the production costs of particular
commodities?  That is, enter into the expenses of
certain branches of production?  Then he should know
that this is only a form of levying taxes on revenue.</p>
<p>With reference to Storch Nassau Senior, the sophist, also
remarks:</p>
<p class="quote">“Mr. Storch is doubtless in error
when he expressly asserts that these <i>results</i>”
(health, good taste, etc.) “like other things which
have value, form part of the <i>revenue</i> of those who
possess them, and that they are also exchangeable”
(that is, in so far as they can be bought from their
produces).  “If this was so, if good taste,
morality, religion, were really <i>things</i> which could be
<i>bought</i>, wealth would have an importance very
different from that given to it by the economists. 
What we buy is not health, knowledge or piety.  The
doctor, the priest, the teacher…can only produce the
instruments by means of which with greater or less certainty
and perfection, these ulterior results will be
produced…  If in each particular case the most
suitable means to obtain success have been employed, the
producer of these <i>means</i> has a right to a reward, even
when he has not succeeded or when he has not produced the
results expected.  The exchange is completed as soon as
the advice or the lesson has been given and the payment for
it has been received” (l.c., pp. 288-89).</p>
<p>Finally, the great Nassau himself adopts the Smithian
distinction.  For in fact he distinguishes between
“productive consumption and unproductive
consumption” (p. 206) instead of between productive
and unproductive labour.  But the object of consumption
is either a commodity—which is not referred to here
—or direct labour.</p>
<p>Consumption would be productive if it employed labour
that either produced labour-power itself (which for example
the schoolmaster’s or the physician’s labour might do) or
<i>reproduced</i> the value of the commodities with which it
was bought.  The consumption of labour which
accomplished neither the one nor the other of these would be
unproductive.  And indeed Smith says: the labour which
can only be consumed productively (i.e., industrially) I
call productive labour, and that which can be consumed
unproductively, whose consumption is by its nature not
industrial consumption, I call unproductive labour. 
Mr. Senior has therefore proved his genius by giving things
new names.</p>
<p>In general, Nassau copies from Storch.</p>

<p><span class="context">||413|</span> Pellegrino Rossi,
Cours d’économie politique (année 1836 to
1837), édit. Bruxelles, 1842.</p>
<p>Here is wisdom!</p>
<p class="quote">“<i>The indirect means</i>” (of
production) “include everything that furthers
production, everything which tends to remove an obstacle, to
make production more active, more speedy, easier.”
(Earlier, p. 268, be says: “There are direct and
indirect means of production.  That is to say, there
are means which are a cause <i>sine qua non</i> of the
effect in question, forces which <i>make</i> this
production.  There are others which contribute to
production, but do not make it.  The former can act
even <i>by themselves</i>, the latter can only help the
former to produce.”) “.., The whole labour of
government is an indirect means of production, … The
man who has made this hat must surely recognise that the
gendarme who goes by in the street, the judge who sits in
his court, the gaoler who takes over a criminal and keeps
him in prison, the army which defends the frontier against
enemy invasions, contribute to production”
(p. 272).</p>
<p>What a pleasure it must be for the hatter, that everyone
gets moving so that he can produce and sell this hat! 
Inasmuch as he makes these gaolers, etc., contribute
<i>indirectly</i>, not <i>directly</i>, to material
production, Rossi in fact makes the same distinction as Adam
(lecture XII).</p>
<p>In the following lecture XIII, Rossi takes the field
particularly against Smith —indeed rather [the same
as] his predecessors.</p>
<p>The erroneous distinction between productive labourers
and unproductive labourers, he says, arises for three
reasons.</p>
<p class="quote">1.  “Among the <i>buyers</i>, some buy
products or <i>labour for their own direct consumption;</i>
others only buy them in order to sell the new products that
they obtain by means of the products and the labour that
they have acquired.”</p>
<p>The determining factor for the former is the
<i>use-value;</i> for the latter, the exchange-value. 
But in paying attention only to exchange-value, one falls
into Smith’s error.</p>
<p class="quote">“My servant’s labour is unproductive
for me: let us admit that for a moment; is it unproductive
for him?” (l.c., pp. 275-76).</p>
<p>As all capitalist production rests on the direct purchase
of labour in order to appropriate a part of it <i>without
purchase</i> in the process of production; which part
however is <i>sold</i> in the product—since this is
the basis of existence of capital, its very essence
—is not the distinction between labour which produces
capital and that which does not produce it the basis for an
understanding of the process of capitalist production? 
Smith does not deny that the servant’s labour is productive
for <i>him</i>.  Every service is productive for its
seller.  To swear false oaths is productive for the
person who does it for cash.  Forging documents is
productive for anyone paid to do it.  A murder is
productive for a man who gets paid for doing it.  The
trade of sycophant, informer, toady, parasite, lickspittle,
is productive for people who do not perform these
“services” gratis.  Hence they are
“productive labourers”, producers not only of
wealth but of capital.  The thief, too, who pays
himself—just as the law-courts and the State do
—“employs his energy, uses it in a particular
way, produces a result which satisfies a human need”,
i.e., the need of the thief and perhaps also that of his
wife and children.  Consequently [he is a] productive
labourer if it is merely a question of producing a
“result” which satisfies a “need”,
or as in the cases mentioned above, if selling his
“services” is enough to make them
“productive”.</p>
<p class="quote">2.  “A second error has been not to
distinguish between direct production and indirect
production.” That is why Adam Smith thinks that a
magistrate is not productive.  But “if production
is almost impossible” (without the magistrate’s
labour) “is it not clear that this labour contributes
to it, if not by direct and material co-operation, at least
by an indirect action which cannot be left out of
account?” (l.c., p. 276).</p>
<p>It is precisely this labour which participates indirectly
in production (and it forms only a part of unproductive
labour) that we call unproductive labour.  Otherwise we
would have to say that since the magistrate is absolutely
unable to live without the peasant, therefore the peasant is
an indirect producer of justice!  And so on. 
Utter nonsense!  There is yet another point of view
hearing on the division of labour, with which we shall deal
later.</p>
<p class="quote">[3.]  “The three principal facts
of the phenomenon of production have not been carefully
distinguished: the <i>force or productive means</i>, the
<i>application</i> of this force, the
<i>result</i>.”</p>
<p>We buy a clock at a clockmarker’s; we are only interested
in the <i>result</i> of the labour.  The same applies
when we buy a coat at the tailor’s.  But:</p>
<p class="quote">“There are still people, men of the
old school, who do not understand things in this way. 
They make a workman come to their home and get him to make
such-and-such a piece of clothing, giving him the material
and everything he needs for this labour.  What is it
that these people buy?  They buy a force” &lt;hut
also an application of this force&gt;, “a means to
produce results of some kind at their peril and
risk…  The object of the contract is the
purchase of a force.”</p>
<p>(The point here is only that these “men of the old
school” make use of a mode of production that has
nothing in common with the capitalist mode, and in which all
development of labour’s productive powers, such as
capitalist production brings with it, is impossible. 
It is characteristic that for Rossi and all the rest of them
such a specific distinction is inessential.)</p>
<p>In the case of a servant, “you buy a force”,
capable of doing “a thousand different things. 
The results it produces depend on the use that you make of
the force” (p. 276).</p>
<p>All this has nothing to do with the matter.</p>
<p class="quote"><span class="context">||414|</span> “To buy or to
hire…a definite application of this force
….You do not buy a product, you do not buy the result
that you have in view.” Will the lawyer’s pleading win
your case?  Who knows?  “What is
certain.  what passes between you and your lawyer, is
that, for a certain value, he will go on a certain day to a
certain place to speak on your behalf, to apply his
intellectual powers in your interests” (p. 276).</p>
<p>&lt;One further point on this.  In lecture XII,
p. 273, Rossi says:</p>
<p class="quote">“I am far from seeing producers only
in those who pass their hives in making cotton cloth or
shoes.  I honour labour, whatever it may be…but
this respect should not be the exclusive privilege of the
<i>manual labourer</i>.”</p>
<p>Adam Smith does not do this.  For him, a person who
produces a book, a painting, a musical composition or a
statue, is a “productive labourer” in the second
sense, although the person who improvises, recites, plays a
musical instrument, etc., is not.  And Adam Smith
treats services, in so far as they directly enter into
production, as materialised in the product, both the labour
of the manual labourer and that of the manager, clerk,
engineer, and even of the scientist in so far as he is an
inventor, an indoor or outdoor labourer for the
workshop.  In dealing with the division of labour,
Smith explains how these operations are distributed among
different persons; and that the product, the commodity, is
the result of their co-operative labour, not of the labour
of any individual among them.  But the
“spiritual” labourers <i>à la</i> Rossi
are anxious to justify the large share which they draw out
of material production.&gt;</p>
<p>After this discourse, Rossi continues:</p>
<p class="quote">“Thus in exchange transactions
attention is fixed on one or other of the three principal
facts of production.  But can <i>these different forms
of exchange</i> deprive certain <i>products</i> of the
character of <i>wealth</i> and deprive the <i>exertions of a
class of producers of the quality of being productive
labours?</i> Clearly, there is no link between these ideas
such as would justify a deduction of this kind. 
Because instead of buying the result, I buy the force
necessary to produce it, why <i>should the action of the
force not be productive</i> and <i>the product not be
wealth?</i> Take again the example of the tailor. 
Whether one buys ready-made clothes from a tailor, or
whether one gets them from a jobbing tailor who has been
given the material and a wage, as far as the results are
concerned the two actions are perfectly similar.  No
one will say that the former is a <i>productive labour</i>
and the latter an <i>unproductive labour;</i> only in the
second case the man <i>who wants a coat</i> has been his
<i>own entrepreneur</i>.  Well, from the standpoint of
productive forces what difference is there between the
jobbing tailor you have brought to your home and your
domestic servant?  None” (l.c., p. 277).</p>
<p>Here we have the quintessence of the whole superwise and
would-be profound windbag!  When Adam Smith, in his
second and more superficial presentation, distinguishes
between productive and unproductive labour, according to
whether it is or is not directly realised in a vendible
commodity for the buyer of the labour, he calls the tailor
productive in both cases.  But according to his more
profound definition the latter is an
“unproductive” labourer.  Rossi only shows
that he “evidently” does not understand Adam
Smith.</p>
<p>That the “<i>forms of exchange</i>” seem to
Rossi to be a matter of complete indifference is just as if
a physiologist said that the different forms of life are a
matter of complete indifference, that they are all only
forms of organic matter.  It is precisely these forms
that are alone of importance when the question is the
specific character of a mode of social production.  A
coat is a coat.  But have it made in the first form of
exchange, and you have capitalist production and modern
bourgeois society; in the second, and you have a form of
handicraft which is compatible even with Asiatic relations
or those of the Middle Ages, etc.  And these
<i>forms</i> are decisive for material wealth itself.</p>
<p>A coat is a coat—that is Rossi’s wisdom.  But
in the first case the jobbing tailor produces not only a
coat, he produces capital; therefore also profit; he
produces his master as a capitalist and himself as a
wage-labourer.  When I have a coat made for me at home
by a jobbing tailor, for me to wear, that no more makes me
my own <i>entrepreneur</i> (in the sense of an economic
category) than it makes the <i>entrepreneur tailor</i> an
entrepreneur when <span class="context">||415|</span> he
himself wears and consumes a coat made by his workmen. 
In one case the purchaser of tailoring labour and the
jobbing tailor confront each other as mere buyers and
sellers.  One pays money and the other supplies the
commodity into whose use-value my money is
transformed.  In this transaction there is no
difference at all from my buying the coat in a shop. 
Buyer and seller confront each other simply as such. 
In the other case, on the contrary, they confront each other
as capital and wage-labour.  As for the domestic
servant, he has the same determinate form as the jobbing
tailor No.  II, whom I buy for the sake of the use-value of
his labour.  Both are simply buyers and sellers. 
But the way in which the use-value is enjoyed in this case
in addition bears a patriarchal form of relation, a relation
of master and servant, which modifies the relation in its
content, though not in its economic form, and makes it
distasteful.</p>
<p>For that matter Rossi only repeats in other phrases what
Garnier said:</p>
<p class="quote">“When Smith wrote that nothing
remained of the servant’s labour, he was mistaken, to a
greater extent, we must say, than an Adam Smith should be
mistaken.  A manufacturer manages himself a larger
manufactory which requires very active and very assiduous
supervision…  This man, not wanting to have
unproductive labourers around him, has no servants, He is
then compelled to <i>serve himself</i>…  What
becomes of his productive labour during the time that he has
to devote to this so-called unproductive labour?  Is it
not evident that your serving people perform a labour which
enables you to apply yourself to a labour more appropriate
to your abilities?  Then how can it be said that no
trace remains of their services?  There remains
everything that you do and that you could not have done if
they had not replaced you in the service of your person and
your home” (l.c., p. 277).</p>
<p>This is once more the <i>labour-saving</i> idea of
Garnier, Lauderdale and Ganilh.  According to this,
unproductive labours would only be productive in so far as
they save labour and leave more time for a person’s own
labour, whether he is an industrial capitalist or a
productive labourer, who can perform a more valuable labour
through this replacement by a less valuable labour.  A
large part of the unproductive labourers who would be
excluded by this are menial servants (in so far as they
provide only luxury articles), and all unproductive
labourers who produce merely enjoyment and whose labour I
can only enjoy in so far as I <i>use just as much time to
enjoy it</i> as its <i>seller uses to produce it</i>, to
provide it for me.  In both cases there can be no talk
of “saving” labour.  Finally, even really
labour-saving personal services would only be productive in
so far as their consumer is a producer.  If he is an
idle capitalist, they only save him the labour of doing
anything at all: like a slut having her hair curled or her
nails cut instead of doing it herself, or a foxhunter
employing a stable-lad instead of being his own stable-lad,
or someone who is just a glutton keeping a cook instead of
cooking for himself.</p>
<p>Then these labourers would include too those who,
according to Storch (l.c.), produce
“<i>leisure</i>”, through which a man gets free
time for pleasure, spiritual labour, and so on.  The
police-man saves me the time of being my own gendarme, the
soldier of defending myself, the government official of
governing myself, the shoe cleaner of cleaning my shoes
myself, the priest the time required for thinking, and so
on.</p>
<p>What is correct in this matter is—<i>the division
of labour</i>.  Everyone, apart from his productive
labour or the exploitation of productive labour, would have
a number of functions to fulfill which would not be
productive and would in part enter into the costs of
consumption.  (The real productive labourers have to
bear these consumption costs themselves and to perform their
unproductive labour themselves.) If these
“services” are pleasant, then sometimes the
master performs them for the servant, as the <i>jus primae
noctis</i><a href="#_ftn28" id="_ftnref28">*</a> shows, or
as is shown by the labour of ruling, etc., which the masters
have always taken on themselves.  This in no way
obliterates the distinction between productive and
unproductive labour, but this distinction itself appears as
a result of the <i>division of labour</i> and thus furthers
the general productivity of the labourers by making
unproductive labour the exclusive function of one section of
labourers and productive labour the exclusive function of
another section.</p>
<p>But even the <i>labour</i> of a number of menial servants
for mere show, to satisfy vanity, “is not
unproductive”.  Why?  Because it produces
<i>something</i>, the satisfaction of vanity, ostentation,
the exhibition of wealth (l.c., p.277).  Here once
again we meet the nonsense that every kind of services
produces something —the courtesan sensual pleasure,
the murderer homicide, etc.  Moreover Smith said that
every form of this trash has its <i>value</i>.  All
that is missing <span class="context">||416|</span> is that
these services are rendered gratis.  That is not the
point in question.  But even if they are rendered
gratis, they will not increase (material) wealth by a single
farthing.</p>
<p>Then the belletristic piffle:</p>
<p class="quote">“The singer (they claim), when he has
finished singing, leaves us nothing—He leaves us a
memory!” (Very fine!) “When you have drunk
champagne, what remains?…Whether the consumption does
or does not follow closely on the act of production, whether
it takes place more or less rapidly, will bring about
different economic results, but the fact of consumption, of
whatever kind it may be, cannot deprive the product of its
character as wealth.  There are immaterial products
which are of greater durability than certain material
products.  A palace lasts a long time, but the
<i>Iliad</i> is a source of even more durable
pleasures” (pp. 277-78).</p>
<p>What bosh!</p>
<p>In the sense in which he is here speaking of wealth, as
use-value, it is precisely <i>consumption</i>, whether slow
or rapid (its length depends on its own nature and on the
nature of the object), and only consumption, that makes the
product wealth at all.  Use-value has only value for
use, and its existence for use is only existence as an
object for consumption, its existence is in
consumption.  Drinking champagne, although this may
produce a “hangover”, is as little productive
consumption as listening to music, although this may leave
behind “a memory”.  If the music is good
and if the listener understands music, the consumption of
music is more sublime than the consumption of champagne,
although the production of the latter is a “productive
labour” and the production of the former is not.</p>
<p>If we consider all the twaddle against Smith’s
distinction between productive and unproductive labour, we
find that Garnier, and perhaps also Lauderdale and Ganilh
(though the latter said nothing new), exhausted [these
polemics].  Those who came later (apart from Storch’s
unsuccessful effort) [produced] merely pretentious literary
arguments, learned prattle.  Garnier is the economist
of the Directory and the Consulate, Ferrier and Ganilh are
the economists of the Empire.  On the other hand
Lauderdale, the Earl, was far more concerned <i>to make
apologies</i>] <i>or consumers by presenting them as the
producers of “unproductive labour</i>”. 
The <i>glorification of</i> servility and flunkeyism, of
tax-gatherers and parasites, runs through the lot of
them.  Compared with these, the rough cynical character
of classical economy stands out as a critique of existing
conditions.</p>

<h3>[19.  Apologia for the Prodigality of the Rich by
the Malthusian Chalmers]</h3>
<p>One of the most fanatic Malthusians is the <i>Reverend
Thomas Chalmers</i>, who thinks that the only means for
curing all social ills is the religious education of the
labouring class (by which he means ramming down their
throats the Malthusian population theory with edifying
Christian priestly trimmings); at the same time he is a
great defender of all abuses, of wasteful expenditure by the
State, of fat livings for the clergy and of wild
extravagance on the part of the rich.  He laments
(p. 260 sqq.)  the spirit of the time, the “hard and
hunger-bitten economy”; and he wants heavy taxes, a
good deal to eat for the “higher” and
unproductive workers, clergymen and so on (l.c.). 
Naturally, he blusters about the Smithian distinction. 
He devoted a whole chapter to it (Chapter XI) which contains
nothing new except that parsimony, etc., only harms
“the productive labourers”, but whose tendency
is exemplified in the following summing up:
This “distinction seems to be nugatory […I;
and withal, mischievous in application” (l.c.,
p. 344).  And in what does this mischief consist?</p>
<p class="quote">“We have entered at so much length
into this argument, because we think <i>the political
economy of our days bears a hard and hostile aspect towards
an ecclesiastical establishment;</i> and we have no doubt,
that to this, <i>the hurtful definition<a href="#_ftn29" id="_ftnref29">*</a> of Smith</i> has largely […]
contributed” (Thomas Chalmers, Professor of Divinity,
<i>On Political Economy, in Connexion with the Moral State
and Moral Prospects of Society</i>, 2nd ed., London, 1832,
p. 346).</p>
<p>By the “ecclesiastical establishment” the
cleric means his own church, the Church of England as by law
“established”.  Moreover he was one of the
fellows who had fostered this “Establishment”
upon Ireland.  The parson is at least plain spoken.</p>
<p><a id="s20"> </a></p>
<h3>[20.  Concluding Observations on Adam Smith and His
Views on Productive and Unproductive Labour]</h3>
<p><span class="context">||417|</span> Before we finish with
Adam Smith, we will cite two further passages, the first, in
which he gives vent to his hatred of the unproductive
government; the second, in which he aims to explain why the
advance of industry, etc., presupposes free labour. 
Concerning <i>Smith’s hatred of the clergy</i>.</p>
<p>The first passage runs:</p>
<p class="quote">“it is the highest impertinence and
presumption, therefore, in kings and ministers, to pretend
to watch over the economy of private people, and to restrain
their expense, either by sumptuary laws, or by prohibiting
the importation of foreign luxuries.  They are
themselves always, and with out any exception, the greatest
spendthrifts in the society.  Let them look well after
their own expense, and they may safely trust private people
with theirs.  If their own extravagance does not ruin
the State, that of their subjects never will”
([<i>Wealth 0f Nations</i>], t, II, l. II, ch. III,
ed. McCulloch, p.  122).</p>
<p>And once more the following passage —<a href="#_ftn29a" id="_ftnref29a">*</a></p>
<p class="quote">“The labour of some of the most
respectable orders in the<a href="#_ftn30" id="_ftnref30">**</a> society is, like that of <i>mental
servants, unproductive of any value</i>,” &lt;it has
value, and therefore costs an equivalent, but it produces no
value&gt; “and does not fix or realise itself in any
permanent subject, or vendible commodity.  … The
sovereign, for example, with all the officers both of
justice and war who serve<a href="#_ftn31" id="_ftnref31">***</a> under him, the whole army and navy,
are <i>unproductive labourers</i>.  They are the
<i>servants</i> of the public, and are maintained by a part
of the annual produce of the <i>industry of other
people</i>…  In the <i>same class</i> must be
ranked…churchmen, lawyers, physicians, men of letters
of all kinds; players, buffoons, musicians, opera-singers,
opera-dancers, etc.” (l.c., pp. 94-95).</p>
<p>This is the language of the still revolutionary
bourgeoisie, which has not yet subjected to itself the whole
of Society, the State, etc.  All these illustrious and
time-honoured occupations— sovereign, judge, officer,
priest, etc., —with all the old ideological
professions to which they give rise, their men of letters,
their teachers and priests, are <i>from an economic
standpoint</i> put on the same level as the swarm of their
own lackeys and jesters maintained by the bourgeoisie and by
idle wealth—the landed nobility and idle
capitalists.  They are mere <i>servants</i> of the
public, just as the others are their servants.  They
live on the produce of <i>other</i> people’s
<i>industry</i>, therefore they must be reduced to the
smallest possible number.  State, church, etc., are
only justified in so far as they are committees to
superintend or administer the common interests of the
productive bourgeoisie; and their costs —since by
their nature these costs belong to the overhead costs of
production—must be reduced to the unavoidable
minimum.  This view is of historical interest in sharp
contrast partly to the standpoint of antiquity, when
material productive labour bore the stigma of slavery and
was regarded merely as a pedestal for the idle citizen, and
partly to the standpoint of the absolute or
aristocratic-constitutional monarchy which arose from the
disintegration of the Middle Ages—as Montesquieu,
still captive to these ideas, so naïvely expressed them
in the following passage (<i>Esprit des lois</i>, l.  VII,
ch. IV): “If the rich do not spend much, the poor will
perish of hunger”.</p>
<p>When on the other hand the bourgeoisie has won the
battle, and has partly itself taken over the State, partly
made a compromise with its former possessors; and has
likewise given recognition to the ideological professions as
flesh of its flesh and everywhere transformed them into its
functionaries, of like nature to itself; when it itself no
longer confronts these as the representative of productive
labour, but when the real productive labourers rise against
it and moreover tell it that it lives on other people’s
industry; when it is enlightened enough not to be entirely
absorbed in production, but to want also to consume
“in an enlightened way”; when the spiritual
labours themselves are more and more performed in its
<i>service</i> and enter into the service of capitalist
production—then things take a new turn, and the
bourgeoisie tries to justify “economically”,
from its own standpoint, what at an earlier stage it had
criticised and fought against.  Its spokesmen and
conscience-salvers in this line are the Garniers, etc. 
In addition to this, these economists, who them-selves are
priests, professors, etc., are eager to prove their
“productive” usefulness, to justify their wages
“economically”.</p>
<p><span class="context">||418|</span> The second passage,
referring to slavery, runs:</p>
<p class="quote">“Such occupations” (as
artificer and manufacturer) “were considered”
(in several of the ancient states) “as fit only for
slaves, and the free citizens of the State were prohibited
from exercising them.  Even in those States where no
such prohibition took place, as in Rome and Athens, the
great body of the people were in effect excluded from all
the trades which are now commonly exercised by the lower
sort of the inhabitants of towns.  Such trades were, at
Athens and Rome., all occupied by the slaves of the rich,
who exercised them for the benefit of their masters, whose
wealth, power, and protection, made it almost impossible for
a poor freeman to find a market for his work, when it came
into competition with that of the slaves of the rich. 
Slaves, however, are very seldom inventive; and all the most
important improvements, either in machinery, or in the
arrangement and distribution of work, which facilitate and
abridge labour have been the discoveries of freemen. 
Should a slave propose any improvement of this kind, his
master would be very apt to consider the proposal as the
suggestion of laziness, and of a desire to save his own
labour at the master’s expense.  The poor slave,
instead of reward would probably meet with much abuse,
perhaps with some punishment.  In the manufactures
carried on by slaves, therefore, more labour must generally
have been employed to execute the same quantity of work,
than in those carried on by freemen.  The work of the
former must, upon that account, generally have been dearer
than that of the latter.  The Hungarian mines, it is
remarked by Mr. Montesquieu, though not richer, have always
been wrought with less expense, and therefore with more
profit, than the Turkish mines in their neighbourhood. 
The Turkish mines are wrought by slaves; and the <i>arms of
those slaves are the only machines</i> which <i>the
Turks</i> have ever thought of employing.  The
Hungarian mines are wrought by freemen, who employ a great
deal of machinery, by which they facilitate and abridge
their own labour.  From the very little that is known
about the price of manufactures in the times of the Greeks
and Romans, it would appear that those of the finer sort
were excessively dear” ( [<i>Wealth of Nations</i>,
O.U.P. edition, Vol. II, pp. 305-06 I l.c., t. III, l. IV,
ch. IX, pp. 549-51, ed. Garnier).</p>
<p>----------------</p>
<p>Adam Smith himself says, l.c., t. III, l. IV, ch. I,
p. 5:</p>
<p class="quote">“Mr. Locke remarks a distinction
between money and other movable goods.  All other
movable goods, he says, are of so <i>consumable a
nature</i>, that the wealth which consists in them cannot be
much depended on…  Money, on the contrary, is a
steady friend” and so on [ibid., p. 3 ].</p>
<p>And again, [Garnier], l. c., pp. 24-25:</p>
<p class="quote">“Consumable commodities, it is said,
are soon destroyed; whereas gold and silver are of a <i>more
durable nature</i>, and were it not for this continual
exportation, might be accumulated for ages together, to the
incredible augmentation of the real wealth of the
country” [ibid., p. 14].</p>
<p>The man of the Monetary system raves about gold and
silver because they are <i>money</i>, the independent,
tangible form of existence of exchange-value; and a form of
its existence that is indestructible, everlasting —in
so far as they are not allowed to become means of
circulation, the merely transient form of the exchange-value
of commodities.  The accumulation of gold and silver,
piling it up, hoarding it, is therefore his way of growing
rich.  And as I showed in the quotation from Petty,
other commodities are themselves valued according to the
degree in which they are more or less durable, that is,
remain exchange-value.</p>
<p>Now <i>in the first place</i> Adam Smith repeats this
idea of the relatively greater or less durability of
commodities in the section where he speaks of consumption
which is more or less advantageous for the formation of
wealth, according as it is consumption of less or more
durable articles of consumption.  Here therefore the
Monetary system peeps through; and necessarily so, since
even in direct consumption there is the mental reservation
that the <span class="context">||419|</span> article of
consumption remains <i>wealth</i>, a commodity, therefore a
unity of use-value and exchange-value; and the latter
depends on the degree to which the use-value is durable,
that is, on how slowly consumption deprives it of the
possibility of being a <i>commodity</i> or bearer of
exchange-value.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, in his second distinction between
productive and unproductive labour he completely returns
—in a wider form —to the distinction made by the
Monetary system.</p>
<p class="quote">Productive labour “fixes and realises itself in
some particular subject or vendible commodity, <i>which
lasts jar some time at least after that labour is
past</i>.  It is, as it were, a certain quantity of
labour stocked and stored up to be employed, if necessary,
upon some other occasion”.</p>
<p class="quote">On the other hand, the unproductive labour’s results or
services “generally perish in the very instant of
their performance, and seldom leave any trace or
<i>value</i> behind them, for which an equal quantity of
service could afterwards be procured” (Vol. II, b. II,
ch. III, ed. McCulloch, p. 94).</p>
<p>Thus Smith makes the same difference between commodities
and services as the Monetary system did between gold and
silver and the other commodities.  With Smith too the
distinction is made from the point of view of accumulation
—no longer however in the form of building a hoard,
but in the real form of reproduction.  The commodity
perishes in consumption, but then it reproduces in turn a
commodity of higher value; or, if it is not so used, it is
itself value, with which another commodity can be
bought.  It is the nature of the product of labour that
it exists in a more or less durable, and therefore again
salable, use-value; in a use-value in which it is a vendible
commodity, a bearer of exchange-value, a <i>commodity</i>,
or, in essence, <i>money</i>.  The services of
unproductive labourers do not again become
<i>money</i>.  I can neither pay debts nor buy
commodities nor buy labour which produces surplus-value with
the services for which I pay the lawyer, doctor, priest,
musician, etc., the statesman or the soldier, etc. 
They have gone, like perishable articles of consumption.</p>
<p>Thus at bottom Smith says the same thing as the Monetary
system.  For them, only that labour is productive which
produces <i>money</i>, gold and silver.  For Smith,
only that labour is productive which produces <i>money</i>
for its buyer; although he discerns the money character in
all commodities in spite of its mask, while the Monetary
system sees it only in the commodity which is the
independent existence of exchange-value.</p>
<p>This distinction is founded on the nature of bourgeois
production itself, since wealth is not the equivalent of
use-value, but only the <i>commodity</i> is wealth,
use-value as bearer of exchange-value, as money.  What
the Monetary system did not understand is how this money is
made and is multiplied through the consumption of
commodities, and not through their transformation into gold
and silver —in which they are crystallised as
independent exchange-value, in which however they not only
lose their use-value, but do not alter the <i>magnitude
of</i> their <i>value</i>.</p>

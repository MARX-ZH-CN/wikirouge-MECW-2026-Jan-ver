<h4>May 3, 1892</h4>
<p>A few lines in a hurry. What was intended as a defeat for us here, has ended in a veritable triumph. We had only two platforms on Sunday, but they were the only ones that drew both public and press. You will have seen our involuntary caricatures in the <i>D</i>[<i>aily</i>] <i>Graphic </i>I sent you. Platform No. 14, the international platform, was the great success of the day. ...</p>
<p>The demonstration itself was immense, even compared with the two previous ones and showed that things <i>are </i>moving here, though they move in that peculiar roundabout way in which the English delight. ...</p>
<p>Anyhow I am glad the thing passed off quietly everywhere. The idea that the 1st of May is to be a day of rows and riots is a mere trap set by the bourgeois and we have no interest whatever to fall into that trap. We want to show our strength, that’s all; as to when we are to use that strength, that’s our business, not that of our opponents, if we can help it.</p>

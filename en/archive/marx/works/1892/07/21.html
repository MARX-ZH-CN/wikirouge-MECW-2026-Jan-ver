<p>The book herewith again made available to the German public first appeared
in the summer of 1845. Both in its strengths and in its weaknesses it bears the
stamp of the author’s youth. At the time, I was twenty-four; today, I am
thrice as old, and as I re-read this early work I find I need not be ashamed of
it on any count. So I have no intention of somehow obliterating this stamp of
youthfulness. I am presenting my work to the reader again, unchanged. I have
only worded more precisely a few not entirely clear passages and added, here
and there, a brief footnote, marked with the present date (1892).</p>
<p>As for the fate of this book, I will only mention that an English
translation of it (by Mrs. Florence Kelley-Wischnewetzky) came out in New York
in 1887 and was also published by Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co. in London in
1892. The preface to the American edition underlies that to the English
one, and the latter in its turn underlies the present German preface. Modern
large-scale industry makes the economic conditions in all the countries
affected uniform to such an enormous extent that I hardly need tell the German
reader anything different from what I tell the American or English.</p>
<p>The state of things described in this book belongs today in many respects,
to the past, as far as England is concerned. Though not expressly stated in our
recognised treatises, it is still a law of modern political economy that the
larger the scale on which capitalistic production is carried on, the less can
it support the petty devices of swindling and pilfering which characterise its
early stages. The pettifogging business tricks of the Polish Jew, the
representative in Europe of commerce in its lowest stage, those tricks that
serve him so well in his own country, and are generally practised there, fail
him once he comes to Hamburg or Berlin; and, again, the commission agent who
hails from Berlin or Hamburg, Jew or Christian, after frequenting the
Manchester Exchange, finds out that in order to buy cotton yarn or cloth cheap,
he, too, had better drop those slightly more refined but still miserable wiles
and subterfuges which are considered the acme of cleverness in his native
country. Of course, with the progress of large-scale industry a great deal has
supposedly changed in Germany too, and a bad odour now attaches, particularly
since the industrial Jena of Philadelphia, 283 even to the time-honoured German
principle: People will be nothing but pleased if we first send them good
samples and then bad goods. The fact is, those tricks do not pay any longer in
a large market, where time is money, and where a certain standard of commercial
morality is unavoidably developed not because of any considerations of virtue,
but purely as a means of saving time and trouble. And exactly the same has
taken place in England with the relation between the manufacturer and his
“hands”.</p>
<p>The revival of trade, after the crisis of 1847, was the dawn of a new
industrial epoch. The repeal of the Corn Laws 184 and the financial reforms
subsequent thereon gave to English industry and commerce all the elbow-room
they had asked for. The discovery of the Californian and Australian goldfields
followed in rapid succession. The colonial markets developed at an increasing
rate their capacity for absorbing English manufactured goods. In India millions
of handweavers were finally crushed out by the Lancashire power-loom. China was
more and more being opened up. But most important of all, America was
developing at a rate unprecedented even for that country of tremendous
progress; and America, it will be recalled, was then merely a colonial market,
indeed the largest of all, i.e., a country supplying raw materials and
importing industrial products, notably from England.</p>
<p>And, finally, the new means of communication introduced at the close of the
preceding period-railways and ocean steamerswere now worked out on an
international scale; they realised actually what had hitherto existed only
potentially, a world-market. This world-market, at the time, was still composed
of a number of chiefly or entirely agricultural countries grouped around one
manufacturing centre – England – which consumed the greater part of
their surplus raw produce, and supplied them in return</p>
<p>with the greater part of their requirements in manufactured articles. No
wonder, therefore, that England’s industrial progress was colossal and
unparallelled, and such that the status of 1844 now appears to us as
comparatively insignificant, almost primitive.</p>
<p>And in proportion as this increase took place, in the same proportion did
manufacturing industry become apparently moralised. The competition of
manufacturer against manufacturer by means of petty thefts upon the workpeople
did no longer pay. Trade had outgrown such low means of making money; the
manufacturing millionaire had to know better than waste his time on petty
tricks of this kind. Such practices were good enough, at best, for small fry in
need of money, who had to snap up every penny in order not to succumb to
competition. Thus the <strong>truck system</strong> was suppressed, the
Ten-Hours’ Bill was enacted, and a number of other secondary reforms
introduced-much against the spirit of Free Trade and unbridled competition, but
quite as much in favour of the giant-capitalist in his competition with his
less favoured brother.</p>
<p>Moreover, the larger the concern, and with it the number of workers, the
greater the loss and inconvenience caused by every conflict with the workers
and thus a new spirit came over the manufacturers, especially the largest ones,
which taught them to avoid unnecessary squabbles, to acquiesce in the existence
and power of <strong>trades unions</strong>, and finally even to discover in
strikes-at opportune times – a powerful means to serve their own ends.
The largest manufacturers, formerly the leaders of the war against the working
class, were now the foremost to preach peace and harmony. And for a very good
reason.</p>
<p>All these concessions to justice and philanthropy were nothing else but
means to accelerate the concentration of capital in the hands of the few and
crushing the smaller competitors, who could not survive without extra receipts
of this sort. To these few, the petty accessory extortions of earlier years had
not only lost all significance but had turned, as it were, into hindrances to
large-scale business. Thus the development of production on the basis of the
capitalistic system has of itself sufficed – at least in the leading
industries, for in the more unimportant branches this is far from being the
case – to do away with all those minor grievances which aggravated the
workman’s fate during its earlier years. And thus it renders more and
more evident the great central fact that the cause of the miserable condition
of the working class is to be sought, not in these minor grievances, but in
<i>the capitalistic system itself. </i>The worker sells to the capitalist his
labour-force for a certain daily sum. After a few hours’ work he has
reproduced the value of that sum; but the substance of his contract is, that he
has to work another series of hours to complete his working-day; and the value
he produces during these additional hours of surplus labour is surplus value,
which costs the capitalist nothing, but yet goes into his pocket. That is the
basis of the system which tends more and more to split up civilised society
into a few Rothschilds and Vanderbilts, the owners of all the means of
production and subsistence, on the one hand, and an immense number of
wage-workers, the owners of nothing but their labour-force, on the other. And
that this result is caused, not by this or that secondary grievance, but by the
system itself – this fact has been brought out in bold relief by the
development of capitalism in England.</p>
<p>Again, the repeated visitations of cholera, typhus, smallpox, and other
epidemics have shown the British bourgeois the urgent necessity of sanitation
in his towns and cities, if he wishes to save himself and family from falling
victims to such diseases. Accordingly, the most crying abuses described in this
book have either disappeared or have been made less conspicuous. Drainage has
been introduced or improved, wide avenues have been opened out athwart many of
the worst “slums”. “Little Ireland” had disappeared,
and the “seven dials” 286 are next on the list for sweeping away.
But what of that? Whole districts which in 1844 I could describe as almost
idyllic have now, with the growth of the towns, fallen into the same state of
dilapidation, discomfort, and misery. Only the pigs and the heaps of refuse are
no longei. tolerated. The bourgeoisie have made further progress in the art of
hiding the distress of the working class. But that, in regard to their
dwellings, no substantial improvement has taken place is amply proved by the
Report of the Royal Commission “On the Housing of the Poor”, 1885.
And this is the case, tool in other. respects. Police regulations have been
plentiful as blackberries; but they can only hedge in the distress of the
workers, they cannot remove it.</p>
<p>But while England has thus outgrown the juvenile state of capitalist
exploitation described by me, other countries have only just attained it.
France, Germany, and especially America, are the formidable competitors who, at
this moment – as foreseen by me <span class="context">[See <i>Report of
the Royal Commission on the Housing of the Working Classes. England and
Wales</i>, 1885.-Ed.]</span> <a id="p28"></a> In 1844 - are more and more
breaking up England’s industrial monopoly. Their manufactures are young
as compared with those of England, but increasing at a far more rapid rate than
the latter; and they have at this moment arrived at about the same phase of
development as English manufacture in 1844. With regard to America, the
parallel is indeed most striking. True, the external surroundings in which the
working class is placed in America are very different, but the same economical
laws are at work, and the results, if not identical in every respect, must
still be of the same order. Hence we find in America the same struggles for a
shorter working-day, for a legal limitation of the working-time, especially of
women and children in factories; we find the truck system in full blossom, and
the cottage system, in rural districts, made use of by the
“BOSSES”, the capitalists and their agents, as a means of
domination over the workers. When I received, in 1886, the American papers with
accounts of the great strike of 12,000 Pennsylvanian coal-miners in the
Connellsville district, I seemed but to read my own description of the North of
England colliers' strike of 1844. The same cheating of the workpeople by false
measure; the same truck system; the same attempt to break the miners’
resistance by the capitalists’ last, but crushing, resource – the
eviction of the men out of their dwellings, the cottages owned by the
companies.</p>
<p>Neither here nor in the English editions did I try to update the book, i.e.
to list one by one the changes that have taken place since 1844. I did not do
it for two reasons. Firstly, I would have had to double the volume of the book.
And secondly, Volume One of Marx’s <i>Capital</i> gives a detailed
description of the condition of the British working class for about 1865, i.e.
the time when Britain’s industrial prosperity had reached its peak. I
would therefore have had to repeat what Marx says.</p>
<p>It will be hardly necessary to point out that the general theoretical
standpoint of this book — philosophical, economical, political —
does not exactly coincide with my standpoint of to-day. Modern international
socialism, since fully developed as a science, chiefly and almost exclusively
through the efforts of Marx, did not as yet exist in 1844. My book represents
one of the phases of its embryonic development; and as the human embryo, in its
early stages, still reproduces the gill-arches of our fish-ancestors, so this
book exhibits everywhere the traces of the descent of modern <span class="context">[See present edition, Vol. 4, pp. 540-47.-Ed.]</span> socialism
from one of its ancestors, German classical philosophy. Thus great stress is
laid on the dictum that communism is not a mere party doctrine of the working
class, but a theory compassing the emancipation of society at large, including
the capitalist class, from its present narrow conditions. This is true enough
in the abstract, but absolutely useless, and sometimes worse, in practice. So
long as the wealthy classes not only do not feel the want of any emancipation,
but strenuously oppose the self-emancipation of the working class, so long the
social revolution will have to be prepared and fought out by the working class
alone. The French bourgeois of 1789, too, declared the emancipation of the
bourgeoisie to be the emancipation of the whole human race; but the nobility
and clergy would not see it; the proposition – though for the time being,
with respect to feudalism, an abstract historical truth – soon became a
mere sentimentalism, and disappeared from view altogether in the fire of the
revolutionary struggle. And to-day, the very people who, from the
“impartiality” of their superior standpoint, preach to the workers
a socialism soaring high above their class interests and class struggles-these
people are either neophytes, who have still to learn a great deal, or they are
the worst enemies of the workers-wolves in sheep’s clothing.</p>
<p>The recurring period of the great industrial crisis is stated in the text as
five years. This was the period apparently indicated by the course of events
from 1825 to 1842. But the industrial history from 1842 to 1868 has shown that
the real period is one of ten years; that the intermediate revulsions were
secondary, and had been increasingly disappearing from 1842 onwards. Since 1868
the state of things has changed again, of which more anon.</p>
<p>I have taken care not to strike out of the text the many prophecies, amongst
others that of an imminent social revolution in England, which my youthful
ardour induced me to venture upon. The wonder is, not that a good many of these
prophecies proved wrong, but that so many of them have proved right, and that
the critical state of English trade, to be brought on by Continental and
especially American competition, which I then foresaw — though in too
short a period — has now actually come to pass. In this respect I am
bound to bring the book up to date, by placing here an article which appeared
in the London Commonweal of March 1, 1885 in English and in <i>Neue Zeit
</i>in June of the same year (Issue 6) in German.</p>
<p>“Forty years ago England stood face to face with a crisis, solvable to
all appearances by force only. The immense and rapid development of
manufactures had outstripped the extension of foreign markets and the increase
of demand. Every ten years the march of industry was violently interrupted by a
general commercial crash, followed, after a long period of’ chronic
depression, by a few short years of prosperity, and always ending in feverish
over-production and consequent renewed collapse. The capitalist class clamoured
for Free Trade in corn, and threatened to enforce it by sending the starving
population of the towns back to the country districts whence they came, to
invade them, as John Bright said, not as paupers begging for bread, but as an
army quartered upon the enemy. The working masses of the towns demanded their
share of political power – the People’s Charter; they were
supported by the majority of the small trading class, and the only difference
between the two was whether the Charter should be carried by physical or by
moral force. Then came the commercial crash of 1847 and the Irish famine, and
with both the prospect of revolution.</p>
<p class="indentb">“The French Revolution of 1848 saved the English
middle class. The Socialistic pronunciamentos of the victorious French workmen
frightened the small middle class of England and disorganised the narrower, but
more matter-of-fact movement of the English working class. At the very moment
when Chartism was bound to assert itself in its full strength, it collapsed
internally before even it collapsed externally, on the 10th of April, 1848. The
action of the working class was thrust into the background. The capitalist
class triumphed along the whole line.</p>
<p class="indentb">“The Reform Bill of 1831 had been the victory of the
whole capitalist class over the landed aristocracy. The repeal of the Corn Laws
was the victory of the manufacturing capitalist not only over the landed
aristocracy, but over those sections of capitalists, too, whose interests were
more or less bound up with the landed interest-bankers, stockjobbers,
fundholders, etc. Free Trade meant the readjustment of the whole home and
foreign, commercial and financial policy of England in accordance with the
interests of the manufacturing capitalists — the class which now <span class="context">[These words belong apparently not to Bright but to his
adherents. See <i>The Quarterly Review, </i>Vol. 71, No. 141, p.
273.-Ed.]</span> represented the nation. And they set about this task with a
will. Every obstacle to industrial production was mercilessly removed. The
tariff and the whole system of taxation were revolutionised. Everything was
made subordinate to one end, but that end of the utmost importance to the
manufacturing capitalist: the cheapening of all raw produce, and especially of
the means of living of the working class; the reduction of the cost of raw
material, and the keeping down – if not as yet the bringing down - of
wages. England was to become the ‘workshop of the world’; all other
countries were to become for England what Ireland already was-markets for her
manufactured goods, supplying her in return with raw materials and food.
England, the great manufacturing centre of an agricultural world, with an
ever-increasing number of corn and cotton-growing Irelands revolving around
her, the industrial sun. What a glorious prospect!</p>
<p class="indentb">“The manufacturing capitalists set about the
realisation of this their great object with that strong common sense and that
contempt for traditional principles which has ever distinguished them from
their more narrow-minded compeers on the Continent. Chartism was dying out. The
revival of commercial prosperity, natural after the revulsion of 1847 had spent
itself, was put down altogether to the credit of Free Trade. Both these
circumstances had turned the English working class, politically, into the tail
of the ‘great Liberal Party’, the party led by the manufacturers.
This advantage, once gained, had to be perpetuated. And the manufacturing
capitalists, from the Chartist opposition, not to Free Trade, but to the
transformation of Free Trade into the one vital national question, had learnt,
and were learning more and more, that the middle class can never obtain full
social and political power over the nation except by the help of the working
class. Thus a gradual change came over the relations between both classes. The
Factory Acts, once the bugbear of all manufacturers, were not only willingly
submitted to, but their expansion into acts regulating almost all trades was
tolerated. Trades Unions, hitherto considered inventions of the devil himself,
were now petted and patronised as perfectly legitimate institutions, and as
useful means of spreading sound economical doctrines amongst the workers. Even
strikes, than which nothing had been more nefarious up to 1848, were now
gradually found out to be occasionally very useful, especially when provoked by
the masters themselves, at their own time. Of the legal enactments, placing the
workman at a lower level or at a disadvantage with regard to the master, at
least the most revolting were repealed. And, practically, that horrid
People’s Charter actually became the political programme of the very
manufacturers who had opposed it to the last. The Abolition of the Property
Qualification and Vote by Ballot are now the law of the land. The Reform Acts
of 1867 and 1884 make a near approach to universal suffrage, at least such as
it now exists in Germany; the Redistribution Bill now before Parliament creates
equal electoral districts-on the whole not more unequal than those of France or
Germany; payment of members, and shorter, if not actually annual Parliaments,
are visibly looming in the distanceand yet there are people who say that
Chartism is dead.</p>
<p class="indentb">“The Revolution of 1848, not less than many of its
predecessors, has had strange bedfellows and successors. The very people who
put it down have become, as Karl Marx used to say, its testamentary executors.
Louis Napoleon had to create an independent and united Italy, Bismarck had to
revolutionise Germany and to restore Hungarian independence, and the English
manufacturers had to enact the People’s Charter.</p>
<p class="indentb">“For England, the effects of this domination of the
manufacturing capitalists were at first startling. Trade revived and extended
to a degree unheard of even in this cradle of modern industry; the previous
astounding creations of steam and machinery dwindled into nothing compared with
the immense mass of productions of the twenty years from 1850 to 1870, with the
overwhelming figures of exports and imports, of wealth accumulated in the hands
of capitalists and of human working power concentrated in the large towns. The
progress was indeed interrupted, as before, by a crisis every ten years, in
1857 as well as in 1866; but these revulsions were now considered as natural,
inevitable events, which must be fatalistically submitted to, and which always
set themselves right in the end.</p>
<p class="indentb">“And the condition of the working-class during this
period? There was temporary improvement even for the great mass. But this
improvement always was reduced to the old level by the influx of the great body
of the unemployed reserve, by the constant superseding of hands by new
machinery, by the immigration of the agricultural population, now, too, more
and more superseded by machines.</p>
<p class="indentb">“A permanent improvement can be recognised for two
‘protected’ sections only of the working class. Firstly, the
factory hands. The fixing by Act of Parliament of their working-day within
relatively rational limits has restored their physical constitution and endowed
them with a moral superiority, enhanced by their local concentration. They are
undoubtedly better off than before 1848. The best proof is that, out of ten
strikes they make, nine are provoked by the manufacturers in their own
interests, as the only means of securing a reduced production. You can never
get the masters to agree to work ‘short time’, let manufactured
goods be ever so unsaleable; but get the workpeople to strike, and the masters
shut their factories to a man.</p>
<p class="indentb">“Secondly, the great Trades Unions. They are the
organisations of those trades in which the labour of Grown-up men predominates,
or is alone applicable. Here the competition neither of women and children nor
of machinery has so far weakened their organised strength. The engineers, the
carpenters and joiners, the bricklayers, are each of them a power, to that
extent that, as in the case of the bricklayers and bricklayers’
labourers, they can even successfully resist the introduction of machinery.
That their condition has remarkably improved since 1848 there can be no doubt,
and the best proof of this is in the fact that for more than fifteen years not
only have their employers been with them, but they with their employers, upon
exceedingly good terms. They form an aristocracy among the working class; they
have succeeded in enforcing for themselves a relatively comfortable position,
and they accept it as final. They are the model working men of Messrs. Leone
Levi &amp; Giffen (and also the worthy Lujo Brentano), and they are very nice
people indeed nowadays to deal with, for any sensible capitalist in particular
and for the whole capitalist class in general.</p>
<p class="indentb">“But as to the great mass of working people, the state
of misery and insecurity in which they live now is as low as ever, if not
lower. The East End of London is an everspreading pool of stagnant misery and
desolation, of starvation when out of work, and degradation, physical and
moral, when in work. And so in all other large towns-abstraction made of the
privileged minority of the workers; and so in the smaller towns and in the
agricultural districts. The law which reduces the value of labour-power to the
value of the necessary means of subsistence, and the other law which reduces
its average price, as a rule, to the minimum of those means of subsistence,
these laws act upon them with the irresistible force of an automatic engine
which crushes them between its wheels.</p>
<p class="indentb">“This, then was the position created by the Free Trade
policy of 1847, and by twenty years of the rule of the manufacturing
capitalists. But then a change came. The crash of 1866 was, indeed, followed by
a slight and short revival about 1873; but that did not last. We did not,
indeed, pass through the full crisis at the time it was due, in 1877 or 1878;
but we have had, ever since 1876, a chronic state of stagnation in all dominant
branches of industry. Neither will the full crash come; nor will the period of
longed-for prosperity to which we used to be entitled before and after it. A
dull depression, a chronic glut of all markets for all trades, that is what we
have been living in for nearly ten years. How is this?</p>
<p class="indentb">“The Free Trade theory was based upon one assumption:
that England was to be the one great manufacturing centre of an agricultural
world. And the actual fact is that this assumption has turned out to be a pure
delusion. The conditions of modern industry, steam-power and machinery, can be
established wherever there is fuel, especially coals. And other countries
besides England-France, Belgium, Germany, America, even Russiahave coals. And
the people over there did not see the advantage of being turned into Irish
pauper farmers merely for the greater wealth and glory of English capitalists.
They set resolutely about manufacturing, not only for themselves, but for the
rest of the world; and the consequence is that the manufacturing monopoly
enjoyed by England for nearly a century is irretrievably broken up.</p>
<p class="indentb">“But the manufacturing monopoly of England is the
pivot of the present social system of England. Even while that monopoly lasted,
the markets could not keep pace with the increasing productivity of English
manufacturers; the decennial crises were the consequence. And new markets are
getting scarcer every day, so much so that even the Negroes of the Congo are
now to be forced into the civilisation attendant upon Manchester calicos,
Staffordshire pottery, and Birmingham hardware. How will it be when
Continental, and especially American, goods flow in in ever-increasing
quantities – when the predominating share, still held by British
manufacturers, will become reduced from year to year? Answer, Free Trade, thou
universal panacea.</p>
<p class="indentb">“I am not the first to point this out. Already in
1883, at the Southport meeting of the British Association, Mr. Inglis Palgrave,
the President of the Economic section, stated plainly that</p>
<p class="quoteb">“‘the days of great trade profits in England were
over, and there was a pause in the progress of several great branches of
industrial labour. The country might <i>almost be said to be entering the
non-progressive state</i>’.</p>
<p class="indentb">“But what is to be the consequence? Capitalist
production cannot stop. It must go on increasing and expanding, or it must die.
Even a Report of the Fifty-Third Meeting of the British Association for the
Advancement of Science; held at Southport in September 1883, now the mere
reduction of England’s lion’s share in the supply of the
world’s markets means stagnation, distress, excess of capital here,
excess of unemployed workpeople there. What will it be when the increase of
yearly production is brought to a complete stop?</p>
<p class="indentb">“Here is the vulnerable place, the heel of Achilles,
for capitalistic production. Its very basis is the necessity of constant
expansion, and this constant expansion now becomes impossible. It ends in a
deadlock. Every year England is brought nearer face to face with the question:
either the country must go to pieces, or capitalist production must. Which is
it to be?</p>
<p class="indentb">“And the working class? If even under the unparalleled
commercial and industrial expansion, from 1848 to 1868, they have had to
undergo such misery; if even then the great bulk of them experienced at best
but a temporary improvement of their condition, while only a small, privileged,
‘protected’ minority was permanently benefited, what will it be
when this dazzling period is brought finally to a close; when the present
dreary stagnation shall not only become intensified, but this, its intensified
condition, shall become the permanent and normal state of English trade?</p>
<p class="indentb">“The truth is this: during the period of
England’s industrial monopoly the English working class have, to a
certain extent, shared in the benefits of the monopoly. These benefits were
very unequally parcelled out amongst them; the privileged minority pocketed
most, but even the great mass had, at least, a temporary share now and then.
And that is the reason why, since the dying-out of Owenism, there has been no
Socialism in England. With the breakdown of that monopoly, the English working
class will lose that privileged position; it will find itself generally –
the privileged and leading minority not excepted-on a level with its
fellow-workers abroad. And that is the reason why there will be Socialism again
in England.”</p>
<p>So I wrote in 1885. In the Preface to the English edition written on January
11, 1892 I continued:</p>
<p class="indentb">“To this statement of the case, as that case appeared
to me in 1885, I have but little to add. Needless to say that to-day there is
indeed ‘Socialism again in England’, and plenty of it-Socialism of
all shades: Socialism conscious and unconscious, Socialism prosaic and poetic,
Socialism of the working class and of the middle class, for, verily, that
abomination of abominations, Socialism, has not only become respectable, but
has actually donned evening dress and lounges lazily on drawing-room causeuses.
That shows the incurable fickleness of that terrible despot of
‘society’, middle-class public opinion, and once more justifies the
contempt in which we Socialists of a past generation always held that public
opinion. At the same time we have no reason to grumble at the symptom
itself.</p>
<a id="p36"></a>
<p class="indentb">“What I consider far more important than this
momentary fashion among bourgeois circles of affecting a mild dilution of
Socialism, and even more than the actual progress Socialism has made in England
generally, that is the revival of the East End of London. That immense haunt of
misery is no longer the stagnant pool it was six years ago. It has shaken off
its torpid despair, has returned to life, and has become the home of what is
called the ‘New Unionism’, that is to say, of the organisation of
the great mass of ‘unskilled’ workers. This organisation may to a
great extent adopt the form of the old Unions of ‘skilled’ workers
but it is essentially different in character. The old Unions preserve the
traditions of the time when they were founded, and look upon the wages system
as a once-for-all established, final fact, which they at best can modify in the
interest of their members. The new Unions were founded at a time when the faith
in the eternity of the wages system was severely shaken; their founders and
promoters were Socialists either consciously or by feeling; the masses, whose
adhesion gave them strength, were rough, neglected, looked down upon by the
working-class aristocracy; but they had this immense advantage, that their
minds were virgin soil, entirely free from the inherited
‘respectable’ bourgeois prejudices which hampered the brains of the
better situated ‘old’ Unionists. And thus we see now these new
Unions taking the lead of the working-class movement generally, and more and
more taking in tow the rich and proud, old Unions.</p>
<p class="indentb">“Undoubtedly, the East Enders have committed colossal
blunders; so have their predecessors, and so do the doctrinaire Socialists who
pooh-pooh them. A large class, like a great nation, never learns better or
quicker than by undergoing the consequences of its own mistakes. And for all
the faults committed in past, present and future, the revival of the East End
of London remains one of the greatest and most fruitful facts of this fin
<i>de siécle, </i>and glad and proud I am to have lived to see it.”</p>
<p>Since I wrote the above, six months ago, the English working-class movement
has again made a good step forward. The parliamentary elections which took
place a few days ago gave both the official parties, Conservative as well as
Liberal, notice in due form that from now on one and the other will have to
reckon with a third party, the workers’ party. This workers’ party
is now only in the process of formation; its elements are still engaged in
shaking off traditional prejudices of all kinds-bourgeois, old trade-unionist,
indeed, even doctrinaire-socialist-in order to be able to get together at last
on ground common to all of them. And yet the instinct to unite which they
followed was already so strong that it produced election results hitherto
unheard-of in England. In London two workers’ have stood for election,
and openly as Socialists at that; the Liberals did not dare to put up one of
theirs against them, and the two Socialists have won by an overwhelming and
unexpected majority <span class="context">[James Keir Hardie and John
Burns. —Ed.]</span>. In Middlesbrough a workers’ candidate <span class="context">[John Havelock Wilson.—Ed.]</span> has stood against a Liberal
and a Conservative and been elected in the teeth of both; on the other hand,
the new workers’ candidates who allied themselves with the Liberals have
been hopelessly defeated, with the exception of a single one. Among those who
so far have been called workers’ representatives, that is, those who are
forgiven their quality of workers because they themselves would willingly drown
it in the ocean of their liberalism, the most significant representative of the
old Unionism, Henry Broadhurst, has suffered a striking defeat because he
declared himself against the eight-hour day. In two Glasgow, one Salford, and
several other constituencies, independent workers’ candidates stood
against candidates of the two old parties; they were beaten, but so were the
Liberal candidates. Briefly, in a number of large-town and industrial
constituencies the workers have resolutely severed all connections with the two
old parties and thus achieved direct or indirect successes such as they had
never scored in any election so far. And the joy on this account among the
workers is boundless. For the first time they have seen and felt what they can
do when they make use of their electoral rights in the interest of their class.
The superstitious belief in the “great Liberal Party” which had
kept a hold on the English workers for nearly forty years has been destroyed.
They have seen by striking examples that they, the workers, are the decisive
force in England if only they have the will and know their own will; and the
1892 elections have been the beginning of that knowledge and that will. The
workers’ movement on the Continent will see to the rest: the Germans and
the French, who are already so strongly represented in parliaments and local
councils, will keep the spirit of emulation of the English sufficiently high by
further successes. And if in the not very distant future it turns out that this
new parliament can get nowhere with Mr. Gladstone, nor Mr. Gladstone with this
parliament, the English workers’ party will surely be sufficiently
constituted to put an early end to the seesaw game of the two old parties which
have been succeeding each other in power and thereby perpetuating bourgeois
rule.</p>

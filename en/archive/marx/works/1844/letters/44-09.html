<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>You would greatly oblige me if you would ascertain by Tuesday at the latest whether or not Frank is willing to undertake <i>publication</i> of the pamphlet against Bauer <span class="context">[The Holy Family]</span>.</p>
<p>It is of complete <i>indifference</i> to me which way he decides. I can find a foreign publisher any day. Only, in the case of this particular pamphlet, in which <i>every</i> word counts, it would be pleasant to have it printed under my own supervision and to be able to correct it personally.</p>
<p>At any rate I beg you to reply speedily.</p>
<p>Ready to reciprocate,<br>
Yours faithfully<br>
Dr Marx</p>
<p>P.S. Since the pamphlet is directed <i>against Bauer</i> and on the whole contains little to which the censor could object, I should hardly suppose that distribution in Germany would present any great difficulty.</p>

<h4>7 October 1844, rue Vanneau 38</h4>
<p>Messrs Hoffmann and Campe, Booksellers, in Hamburg Julius Campe, Esq. </p>
<p>Dear Sir, Engels and I have written a pamphlet of some ten sheets against Bruno Bauer and his supporters <span class="context">[The Holy Family]</span>.</p>
<p>It deals with themes from philosophy, history and idealism, contains a critique of the <i>Mystères de Paris</i> <span class="context">[novel by Eugène Sue]</span> etc., and will not be without interest for Germany. Nor, by and large, will it be objectionable to the censors.</p>
<p>Should you wish to undertake its publication, I would request you to reply forthwith, since the pamphlet cannot but lose in interest if printing is delayed.<sup class="enote">[6]</sup> If Heine is still in Hamburg, would you be so kind as to convey to him my best thanks for the poems he sent. I have not yet had any real opportunity of doing anything about the first part, the ballads, as I wish to advertise the first part yet  at the same time. <sup class="enote">[7]</sup></p>
<p>Yours faithfully<br>
Dr Marx</p>

<p class="fst">Dear Marx,</p>
<p class="fst">No doubt you are surprised, and justifiably
so, not to have heard from me sooner; however I still cannot tell you even
now anything about my return. I’ve been stuck here in Barmen for the past
three weeks, amusing myself as best I can with few friends and many relations
amongst whom, fortunately, there are half a dozen amiable women. Work is
out of the question here, more especially since my sister [Marie] has become
engaged to the London communist, Emil Blank, an acquaintance of Ewerbeck’s
and, of course, the house is now in a hellish state of turmoil. Moreover,
it’s clear to me that considerable obstacles will continue to be placed
in the way of my return to Paris, and that I may well have to spend six
months or a whole year hanging about in Germany; I shall, of course, do
everything I can to avoid this, but you have no idea what petty considerations
and superstitious fears I have to contend with.</p>
<p class="fst">I spent three days in Cologne and marvelled at the tremendous
propaganda we had put out there. Our people are very active, but the lack
of adequate backing is greatly felt. Failing a few publications in which
the principles are logically and historically developed out of past ways
of thinking and past history, and as their necessary continuation, the
whole thing will remain rather hazy and most people will be groping in
the dark. Later I was in Duesseldorf, where we also have some able fellows.
The ones I like best, by the way, are my Elberfelders, in whom a humane
way of thinking has truly become second nature; these fellows have really
begun to revolutionise their family lives and lecture their elders whenever
these try to come the aristocrat over the servants or workmen – and that’s
saying a great deal in patriarchal Elberfeld. But besides this particular
group there’s another in Elberfeld which is also very good, though somewhat
more muddled. In Barmen the police inspector is a communist. The day before
yesterday I was called on by a former schoolfellow, a grammar school teacher
<sup class="enote"><a href="#n1">[1]</a></sup> , who’s been thoroughly bitten although he’s had
no contact whatever with communists. If we could bring direct influence
to bear on the people, we’d soon get the upper hand, but such a thing is
virtually impossible, especially since we writers have to keep quiet if
we’re not to be nabbed. Otherwise it’s safe enough here, no one bothers
much about us so long as we keep quiet, and it seems to me that Hess’ fears
are little more than phantoms. I’ve not been molested at all here so far,
although the public prosecutor once insistently questioned one of our people
about me, but up till now I haven’t had wind of anything else.</p>
<p class="fst">According to the paper here, Bernays <sup class="enote"><a href="#n2">[2]</a></sup> has
been charged by the government here and taken to court in Paris. Let me
know whether this is true, and also how the pamphlet <sup class="enote"><a href="#n3">[3]</a></sup>
is getting on; presumably it’s finished by now. Nothing has been heard
of the Bauers here, nobody knows anything about them. On the other hand,
every one is still scrambling to get hold of the <i>Jahrbücher.</i> <sup class="enote"><a href="#n4">[4]</a></sup> My article on Carlyle <sup class="enote"><a href="#n5">[5]</a></sup> has, absurdly
enough, earned me a tremendous reputation among the ‘mass’, whereas only very
few have read the one on Economy. <sup class="enote"><a href="#n6">[6]</a></sup> That’s natural
enough.</p>
<p class="fst">In Elberfeld, too, the clerical gentry have been preaching against
us, at least Krummacher has; for the present they confine themselves to
the atheism of the young, but I hope this will soon be followed by a philippic
against communism. Last summer the whole of Elberfeld talked of nothing
but these godless fellows. By and large, the movement here is remarkable.
Since I was here last <sup class="enote"><a href="#n7">[7]</a></sup> , the Wupper valley has made
greater progress in every respect than in the preceding fifty years. Social
manners have become more civilised, participation in politics, in the opposition
is widespread, industry has made enormous progress, new districts have
been added to the towns, entire woods have been grubbed up, and the level
of civilisation throughout the region is indeed above rather than below
that in Germany as a whole, whereas only four years ago it was far lower.
In other words this promises to be first-rate soil for our principle, and
if only we can get our wild, hot-blooded dyers and bleachers on the move,
the Wupper valley will surprise you yet. As it is, the workers had already
reached the final stage of the old civilisation a few years ago, and the
rapid increase in crime, robbery and murder is their way of protesting
against the old social organisation. At night the streets are very unsafe,
the bourgeoisie is beaten, stabbed and robbed; and, if the proletarians
here develop according to the same laws as in England, they will soon realise
that this way of protesting as <i>individuals</i> and with violence against
the social order is useless, and they will protest, through communism,
in their general capacity as <i>human beings.</i> If only one could show
these fellows the way! But that’s impossible.</p>
<p class="fst">My brother [Hermann] is at present a soldier in Cologne and, so
long as he remains above suspicion, will provide a good address to which
letters for Hess, etc., may be sent. At the moment I myself am not sure
of his exact address and cannot therefore let you have it.</p>
<p class="fst">Since writing the above I have been in Elberfeld, where I once
again came across several communists I had never heard of before. Turn
where you will, go where you may, you’ll stumble on a communist. A very
impassioned communist, a cartoonist and aspiring historical painter by
the name of Seel will be going to Paris in two months’ time. I’ll direct
him to you; the fellow’s enthusiasm and his painting and love of music
will appeal to you, and he may very well come in useful as a cartoonist.
It’s possible, but not very probable, that I may be there myself by then.</p>
<p class="fst">A few copies of <i>Vorwarts!</i> <sup class="enote"><a href="#n8">[8]</a></sup> arrive
here and I have seen to it that others place orders as well; ask the dispatch
department to send specimen copies to the following in Elberfeld: Richard
Roth, Captain Wilhelm Blank <i>junior</i>, F. W. Strijeker, Meyer, a Bavarian
publican in the Funkenstrasse (a communist beerhouse), all to be sent through
Baedeker, the communist bookseller, and under sealed cover. Once the fellows
see that copies are coming in, they, too, will place orders. Also to W.
Mueller, M.D., in Duesseldorf; and, if you like, to d’Ester, M.D., Loellchen,
<sup class="enote"><a href="#n9">[9]</a></sup> the publican, your brother-in-law<sup class="enote"><a href="#n10">[10]</a></sup>,
 etc., in Cologne. All of them, of course, through the booksellers and
under sealed cover.</p>
<p class="fst">See to it that the material you’ve collected is soon launched
into the world.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n11">[11]</a></sup> It’s high time, heaven knows! I
too shall settle down to work and make a start this very day. The Teutons
are all still very muddled about the practicability of communism; to dispose
of this absurdity I intend to write a short pamphlet showing that communism
has already been put into practice and describing in popular terms how
this is at present being done in England and America. <sup class="enote"><a href="#n12">[12]</a></sup>
The thing will take me three days or so, and should prove very enlightening
for these fellows. I’ve already observed this when talking to people here.</p>
<p class="fst">Down to work, then, and quickly into print! Convey my greetings
to Ewerbeck, Bakunin, Guerrier and the rest, not forgetting your wife,
and write very soon to tell me all the news. If this letter reaches you
safely and unopened, send your reply under sealed cover to F. W. Struecker
and Co., Elberfeld, with the address written in as commercial a hand as
possible; otherwise, to any of the other addresses I gave Ewerbeck. I shall
be curious to know whether the postal sleuth-hounds are deceived by the
ladylike appearance of this letter.</p>
<p class="fst">Goodbye for the present, dear Karl, and write very soon. I have
not been able to recapture the mood of cheerfulness and goodwill I experienced
during the ten days I spent with you. I have not as yet had any real opportunity
of doing anything about the establishment we are to establish. <sup class="enote"><a href="#n13">[13]</a></sup></p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="information">
<strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> This is the earliest extant letter of Engels to Marx,
written soon after Engels’ return to Germany from England. On his way back
to Germany, at the end of August 1844, he stopped in Paris, where he met
Marx. During the days they spent together they discovered that their theoretical
views coincided, and they immediately began their first joint work, directed
against the Young Hegelians. Engels finished his part before leaving Paris,
while Marx continued to write his. At first, they intended to call the
book <i>A Critique of Critical Criticism. Against Bruno Bauer and Co.</i>
But while it was being printed, Marx added <i>The Holy Family</i> to the
title.</p>
<p class="information">
This meeting of Marx and Engels in Paris marked the beginning
of their friendship, joint scientific work and revolutionary struggle.</p>
<p class="information">
The extant original of this letter bears no date. The approximate
time of its writing was determined on the basis of Engels’ letter to Marx
of November 19 1844.</p>
<p class="information">
This letter was printed in English in full for the first time
in: Marx and Engels, <i>Selected Correspondences</i>, Foreign Languages
Publishing House, Moscow, 1955.</p>

the German newspaper <i>Vorwärts!</i>, published in Paris, was sued by
the French authorities in September 1844 at the request of the Prussian
Government for not having paid the caution-money required for the publication
of a political newspaper. The real reason, however, was the article ‘Attentat
auf den König von Prüssen’, published in <i>Vorwärts!</i>, No. 62, 3 August 1844. On 13 December 1844 Bernays was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment and a fine. </p>

to the newspaper <i>Vorwarts!</i>, which prior to that – from early 1844
to the summer of the same year – reflected the moderate liberalism of
its publisher, the German businessman H. Boernstein, and its editor A.
Bornstedt. However, when Karl Bernays, a friend of Marx, became its editor in
the summer of 1844, the newspaper assumed a democratic character. By
contributing to the newspaper, Marx began to influence its policy and in
September became one of its editors. Other contributors were Engels, Heine,
Herwegh, Ewerbeck and Bakunin. Under Marx’s influence, the newspaper came to
express communist views and attacked Prussian absolutism and moderate German
liberalism. At the behest of the Prussian Government, the Guizot ministry
took repressive measures against its editors and contributors in January
1845, when publication ceased.</p>

der Politik und National-ökonomie</i>, a work which Marx planned to write.
Marx began to study political economy at the end of 1843 and by spring
1844 he set himself the task of writing a criticism of bourgeois political
economy from the standpoint of materialism and communism. The draft "Economic
and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844", written at that time, have reached
us incomplete. Work on <i>The Holy Family</i> forced Marx to temporarily
interrupt his study of political economy until December 1844. In February
1845, just before his expulsion from Paris, he signed a contract for his
<i>Kritik der Politik und National-ökonomie</i> with the publisher Leske.
In Brussels, Marx continued to study the works of English, French, German,
Italian and other economists and added several more notebooks of excerpts
to those compiled in Paris, although his original plan for the book was
not carried out.</p>

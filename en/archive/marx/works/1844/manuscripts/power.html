<h3>The Power of Money</h3>
<p class="fst">
<a href="footnote.html#fn40" target=_blank>[40]</a> If man’s <i>feelings</i>, passions, etc., are not merely anthropological phenomena in the (narrower) sense, but truly <i>ontological</i> <a href="footnote.html#fn41" target=_blank>[41]</a> affirmations of being (of nature), and if they are only really affirmed because their <i>object </i>exists for them as a <i>sensual </i>object, then it is clear that:</p>
<p class="indentb">
1. They have by no means merely one mode of affirmation, but rather that the distinct character of their existence, of their life, is constituted by the distinct mode of their affirmation.  In what manner the object exists for them, is the characteristic mode of their <i>gratification.</i></p>
<p class="indentb">
2. Wherever the sensuous affirmation is the direct annulment of the object in its independent form (as in eating, drinking, working up of the object, etc.), this is the affirmation of the object.</p>
<p class="indentb">
3. Insofar as man, and hence also his feeling, etc., is <i>human, </i>the affirmation of the object by another is likewise his own gratification.</p>
<p class="indentb">
4. Only through developed industry – i.e., through the medium of private property – does the ontological essence of human passion come into being, in its totality as well as in its humanity; the science of man is therefore itself a product of man’s own practical activity.</p>
<p class="indentb">
5. The meaning of private property – apart from its estrangement  –  is the <i>existence of essential objects </i>for man, both as objects of enjoyment and as objects of activity. </p>
<p>
By possessing the <i>property </i>of buying everything, by possessing the property of appropriating all objects, <i>money</i> is thus the <i>object </i>of eminent possession.  The universality of its <i>property </i>is the omnipotence of its being.  It is therefore regarded as an omnipotent being. Money is the <i>procurer</i> between man’s need and the object, between his life and his means of life.  But <i>that which </i>mediates <i>my</i> life for me, also <i>mediates</i> the existence of other people for me.  For me it is the <i>other </i>person.  </p>
<p class="indentb">
“What, man! confound it, hands and feet<br>
And head and backside, all are yours!<br>
And what we take while life is sweet,<br>
Is that to be declared not ours?</p>
<p class="indentc">
“Six stallions, say, I can afford,<br>
Is not their strength my property?<br>
I tear along, a sporting lord,<br>
As if their legs belonged to me.”</p>
<p class="indentb">
Goethe: <i>Faust </i>(Mephistopheles) </p>
<p>
Shakespeare in <i>Timon of Athens:</i> </p>
<p class="indentb">
“Gold?  Yellow, glittering, precious gold? <br>No, Gods, I am no idle votarist! ...<br>
Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair,<br>
Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.<br>
... Why, this<br>
Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,<br>
Pluck stout men’s pillows from below their heads:<br>
This yellow slave<br>
Will knit and break religions, bless the accursed;<br>
Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves<br>
And give them title, knee and approbation<br>
With senators on the bench: This is it<br>
That makes the wappen’d widow wed again;<br>
She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores<br>
Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices<br>
To the April day again.  Come, damned earth,<br>
Thou common whore of mankind, that put’st odds<br>
Among the rout of nations.” </p>
<p>
And also later: </p>
<p class="indentb">
“O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce<br>
‘Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler<br>
Of Hymen’s purest bed! thou valiant Mars!<br>
Thou ever young, fresh, loved and delicate wooer<br>
Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow<br> That lies on Dian’s lap!  Thou <i>visible God! </i><br>
That solder’st <i>close impossibilities</i>,<br>
And makest them kiss!  That speak’st with every tongue,<br>
<span class="context">||XLII|</span> To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts!<br>
Think, thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue<br>
Set them into confounding odds, that beasts<br>
May have the world in empire!” </p>
<p>
Shakespeare excellently depicts the real nature of <i>money.  </i>To understand him, let us begin, first of all, by expounding the passage from Goethe.</p>
<p>
That which is for me through the medium of <i>money</i> – that for which I can pay (i.e., which money can buy) – that am <i>I myself, </i>the possessor of the money.  The extent of the power of money is the extent of my power.  Money’s properties are my – the possessor’s  –  properties and essential powers.  Thus, what I <i>am</i> and <i>am capable of</i> is by no means determined by my individuality.  I <i>am</i> ugly, but I can buy for myself the <i>most beautiful </i>of women.  Therefore I am not <i>ugly</i>, for the effect of <i>ugliness</i>  –  its deterrent power – is nullified by money. I, according to my individual characteristics, am <i>lame</i>, but money furnishes me with twenty-four feet.  Therefore I am not lame.  I am bad, dishonest, unscrupulous, stupid; but money is honoured, and hence its possessor.  Money is the supreme good, therefore its possessor is good.  Money, besides, saves me the trouble of being dishonest: I am therefore presumed honest.  I am <i>brainless, </i>but money is the <i>real</i> <i>brain </i>of all things and how then should its possessor be brainless?  Besides, he can buy clever people for himself, and is he who has <span class="context">[In the manuscript: ‘is’. – <i>Ed</i>.]</span> power over the clever not more clever than the clever?  Do not I, who thanks to money am capable of <i>all</i> that the human heart longs for, possess all human capacities?  Does not my money, therefore, transform all my incapacities into their contrary?</p>
<p>
If <i>money </i>is the bond binding me to <i>human </i>life, binding society to me, connecting me with nature and man, is not money the bond of all <i>bonds?  </i>Can it not dissolve and bind all ties?  Is it not, therefore, also the universal <i>agent of separation?  </i>It is the coin that really <i>separates </i>as well as the real <i>binding agent</i> – the [...] <span class="context">[One word in the manuscript cannot be deciphered. – <i>Ed</i>.]</span> <i>chemical </i>power of society.</p>
<p>
Shakespeare stresses especially two properties of money:</p>
<p class="indentb">
1. It is the visible divinity – the transformation of all human and natural properties into their contraries, the universal confounding and distorting of things: impossibilities are soldered together by it.</p>
<p class="indentb">
2. It is the common whore, the common procurer of people and nations.</p>
<p>
The distorting and confounding of all human and natural qualities, the fraternisation of impossibilities – the <i>divine</i> power of money – lies in its <i>character </i>as men’s estranged, alienating and self-disposing <i>species-nature.  </i>Money is the alienated <i>ability of mankind.</i></p>
<p>
That which I am unable to do as a <i>man</i>, and of which therefore all my individual essential powers are incapable, I am able to do by means of <i>money</i>.  Money thus turns each of these powers into something which in itself it is not – turns it, that is, into its <i>contrary.</i></p>
<p>
If I long for a particular dish or want to take the mail-coach because I am not strong enough to go by foot, money fetches me the dish and the mail-coach: that is, it converts my wishes from something in the realm of imagination, translates them from their meditated, imagined or desired existence into their <i>sensuous, actual </i>existence – from imagination to life, from imagined being into real being.  In effecting this mediation, [money] is the <i>truly creative </i>power.</p>
<p>
No doubt the <i>demand</i> also exists for him who has no money, but his demand is a mere thing of the imagination without effect or existence for me, for a third party, for the [others],<span class="context">||XLIII|</span>  and which therefore remains even for me <i>unreal</i> and <i>objectless</i>. The difference between effective demand based on money and ineffective demand based on my need, my passion, my wish, etc., is the difference between <i>being</i> and <i>thinking</i>, between that which <i>exists</i> within me merely as an idea and the idea which exists as a <i>real object </i>outside of me.</p>
<p>
If I have no money for travel, I have no need – that is, no real and realisable need – to travel.  If I have the <i>vocation</i> for study but no money for it, I have no vocation for study  –  that is, no <i>effective</i>, no <i>true</i> vocation.  On the other hand, if I have really <i>no</i> vocation for study but have the will and the money for it, I have an <i>effective </i>vocation for it.  <i>Money</i> as the external, universal <i>medium</i> and<i> faculty </i>(not springing from man as man or from human society as society) for turning an <i>image into reality</i> and <i>reality into a mere image</i>, transforms the <i>real essential powers of man and nature </i>into what are merely abstract notions and therefore <i>imperfections</i> and tormenting chimeras, just as it transforms <i>real imperfections and chimeras</i> – essential powers which are really impotent, which exist only in the imagination of the individual – into <i>real powers and faculties.  </i>In the light of this characteristic alone, money is thus the general distorting of <i>individualities </i>which turns them into their opposite and confers contradictory attributes upon their attributes.</p>
<p>
Money, then, appears as this <i>distorting </i>power both against the individual and against the bonds of society, etc., which claim to be <i>entities </i>in themselves.  It transforms fidelity into infidelity, love into hate, hate into love, virtue into vice, vice into virtue, servant into master, master into servant, idiocy into intelligence, and intelligence into idiocy.</p>
<p>
Since money, as the existing and active concept of value, confounds and confuses all things, it is the general <i>confound</i>ing <i>and confusing </i>of all things – the world upside-down – the confounding and confusing of all natural and human qualities.</p>
<p>
He who can buy bravery is brave, though he be a coward.  As money is not exchanged for any one specific quality, for any one specific thing, or for any particular human essential power, but for the entire objective world of man and nature, from the standpoint of its possessor it therefore serves to exchange every quality for every other, even contradictory, quality and object: it is the fraternisation of impossibilities.  It makes contradictions embrace.</p>
<p>
Assume <i>man</i> to be <i>man</i> and his relationship to the world to be a human one: then you can exchange love only for love, trust for trust, etc.  If you want to enjoy art, you must be an artistically cultivated person; if you want to exercise influence over other people, you must be a person with a stimulating and encouraging effect on other people.  Every one of your relations to man and to nature must be a <i>specific</i> <i>expression, </i>corresponding to the object of your will, of your <i>real individual </i>life.  If you love without evoking love in return – that is, if your loving as loving does not produce reciprocal love; if through a <i>living expression </i>of yourself as a loving person you do not make yourself a <i>beloved one, </i>then your love is impotent – a misfortune.<span class="context">|XLIII||</span></p>

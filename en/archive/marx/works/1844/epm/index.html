<p class="information">
Written by Karl Marx between April and August 1844
while living in Paris. It was during this period that Marx and Engels would
<a href="index2.gif">meet and become
friends</a>.</p>

The first thing to realize in reading this (now-famous) text is
that it is a very rough draft and was by no means intended for publication
as is. It represents Marx's first foray into analyzing political economy
-- a pursuit he'd undertake doggedly over the coming decades, leading ultimately
to <i><a href="../../1867-c1/index.html" target=_blank>Capital</a></i>.</p>
<p class="information">
<a id="002"></a>
Marx's research into political economy convinced him a larger
published work was possible. On February 1 1845, he signed a contract with
Darmstadt publisher Carl Leske for a book to be titled <i>A Critique of
Politics and of Political Economy</i>. It was never completed for a variety
of reasons and Leske cancelled the deal in September 1846, wanting to distance
himself from the controversial political refugee.</p>

NOTE: Substantial portions of the manuscripts have never been
found, the most extreme case being the Second Manuscript, of which only
pages 40-43 remain. Also note that the subheaders used in the Third Manuscript
are not Marx's and are added to facilitate reading and organization, following
the general style Marx established in the subheadings of the First Manuscript.

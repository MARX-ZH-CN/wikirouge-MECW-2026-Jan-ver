<p class="indentb">In good King Charles’s golden days<br>
When loyalty no harm meant, <br>
A zealous high-church man I was, <br>
And so I got preferment:</p>
<p class="indentb">To teach my flock I never miss'd,<br>
Kings are by God appointed,<br>
And damn'd are those that do resist.<br>
Or touch The Lord’s Anointed.<br>
And this is law I will maintain,<br>
Until my dying day, sir,<br>
That whatsoever king shall reign,<br>
I'll be the vicar of Bray, sir.</p>
<p class="indentb">When royal James obtain'd the crown,<br>
And popery came in fashion,<br>
The penal laws I hooted down,<br>
And read the Declaration:<br>
The church of Rome I found would fit<br>
Full well my constitution;<br>
And had become a Jesuit,<br>
But for the Revolution<br>
And this is law, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="indentb">When William was our King declar'd,<br>
To case the nation’s grievance;<br>
With this new wind about I steer'd,<br>
And swore to him allegiance:<br>
Old principles I did revoke,<br>
Set conscience at a distance;<br>
Passive obedience was a joke,<br>
A jest was non-resistance.<br>
And this is law, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="indentb">When gracious Ann became our queen,<br>
The church of England’s glory,<br>
Another face of things was seen,<br>
And I became a tory:<br>
Occasional conformists base,<br>
I damn'd their moderation;<br>
And thought the church in danger was,<br>
By such prevarication.<br>
And this is law, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="indentb">When George in pudding-time came o'er,<br>
And moderate men look'd big, sir,<br>
I turn'd a cat-in-pan once more,<br>
And so became a whig, sir;<br>
And thus preferment I procur'd<br>
From our new faith’s-defender;<br>
And almost ev'ry day abjur'd<br>
The Pope and the Pretender.<br>
And this is law &amp;c.</p>
<p class="indentb">Th'illustrious house of Hanover,<br>
And Protestant succession;<br>
To these I do allegiance swear <br>
While they can keep possession:<br>
For in my faith and loyalty,<br>
I never more will falter,<br>
And George my lawful king shall be <br>
Until the times do alter.<br>
And this is law I will maintain,<br>
Until my dying day, air,<br>
That whatsoever king shall reign,<br>
I'll be the vicar of Bray, sir!</p>
<p>The song given above is probably the only political folk song remaining popular in England for more than a hundred and sixty years. It owes this in great measure also to its wonderful tune, which is still sung widely today.</p>

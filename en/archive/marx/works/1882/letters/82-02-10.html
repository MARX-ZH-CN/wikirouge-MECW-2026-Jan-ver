<h4>London, February 10 1882</h4>
<p class="fst">Dear Old Man,</p>
<p>We had absolutely no idea that you were so
seriously ill; all we knew was that you had been suffering from erysipelas
and that's something that can be cleared up pretty easily. Had I had an
inkling of how matters stood, I should have raised some money for you straight
away, even though I myself was very short at the time and calls were being
made on me from all sides. However, it's still not too late and I've therefore
taken out a money order for you for four pounds = 100 frs 80 cts. of which
you will doubtless have already been advised; because of an irregularity
that cropped up here I wasn't able to write until today.</p>
<p>Between ourselves, one might almost count it a blessing that Marx
should have been so preoccupied with his own illness during his wife's
last days as to prevent him being unduly preoccupied with his loss, both
when it was impending and when it actually happened. Even though we had
known for 6 months or more how matters stood, the event itself still came
as a terribly hard blow. Marx left yesterday for the South of France <a href="#n1">[1]</a>;
where he will go from there won't be definitely decided until he gets to
Paris. Under no circumstances will he make for Italy first; at the start
of his convalescence even the <i>possibility</i> of harassment by the police
must be avoided.</p>
<p>We have thought about your proposal <a href="#n2">[2]</a> and
take the view that the time has not yet come, though it soon will, to put
it into effect. Firstly, a new, formally reorganised International in Germany,
Austria, Hungary, Italy and Spain would only give rise to fresh persecution
and ultimately leave one with the choice either of giving the thing up,
or of carrying on in <i>secret</i>. The latter option would be a calamity
on account of the inevitable passion for coups and conspiracies and the
no less inevitable admittance of 
<i>mouchards</i> <span class="context">["informers"]</span>. Even in
France the renewed application of the law banning the International, <a href="#n3">[3]</a>
a law which has not been repealed  –  far from it  –  is by no means impossible.
 –  Secondly, in view of the current wrangles between the <i>Egalite</i>
and the <i>Proletaire</i>, there's absolutely no counting on the French;
we would have to declare ourselves for one party or the other and that,
too, has its disadvantages. As individuals we are on the side of the
<i>Egalite</i>, but shall take good care not to support them publicly <i>just
now</i> after the succession of tactical blunders they have made, despite our
express warnings.  –  Thirdly, the English are proving more intractable than
ever at present. For 5 whole months I tried, through <i>The Labour
Standard</i>, for which I wrote leading articles, <a href="#n4">[4]</a> to
pick up the threads of the old Chartist movement and disseminate our ideas so
as to see whether this might evoke some response. Absolutely nothing, and
since the editor, a well-meaning but feeble milksop, ended up by taking
fright even at the Continental heresies I introduced into the paper, I called
it a day.</p>
<p>Thus, we should have been left with an International confined,
apart from Belgium, <i>exclusively to refugees</i>, for with the possible
exception of Geneva and its environs we couldn't even count on the <i>Swiss
 –  vide</i> the <i>Arbeiterstimme</i> and Buerkli. It would, however, hardly
be worth the trouble to set up a mere refugee association. For the Dutch,
Portuguese and Danes wouldn't really improve matters either and the less
one has to do with Serbs and Romanians the better.</p>
<p>On the other hand the International does indeed still <i>exist</i>.
In so far as it can be effective, there is liaison between the revolutionary
workers of all countries. Every socialist journal is an international centre;
from Geneva, Zurich, London, Paris, Brussels and Milan the threads run
criss-cross in all directions and I honestly don't see how at this juncture
the grouping of these small centres round a large main centre could give
added strength to the movement  –  it would probably only lead to greater
friction. But once the moment comes for us to concentrate our forces, it
will, for that very reason, be the work of a moment, nor will any lengthy
preparation be called for. The names of the pioneers in one country are
known in all the others and a manifesto signed and supported by them all
would make a tremendous impact  –  something altogether different from the
largely unknown names of the old General Council. But that is precisely
why such a manifesto should be saved up for the moment when it can really
strike home, i.e. when events in Europe provoke it. Otherwise you will
detract from its future effect and will simply have put yourselves out
for nothing. But such events are already taking shape in Russia where the
avant-garde of the revolution will be going into battle. You should  – 
or so we think  –  wait for this and its inevitable repercussions on Germany,
and then the moment will also have come for a big manifesto and the establishment
of an <i>official</i>, formal International, which can, however, no longer
be a propaganda association but simply an association for action. For that
reason we are firmly of the opinion that so splendid a weapon ought not
to be dulled and blunted during the comparatively peaceful days on the
very eve of the revolution.</p>
<p>I believe that if you think the matter over again you will come
round to our view. Meanwhile we both wish you a good and speedy recovery
and hope to hear before long that you are quite all right again.</p>
<p class="fst">
Ever your old friend,

<p class="fst"><span class="term">1.</span> In early February 1882, following medical advice,
Marx took a trip to Algiers, where he stayed from 20 February to 2 May.
On the way there, he stopped over in Argenteuil (a Paris suburb) to visit
his daughter Jenny.</p>
<a id="n2"></a>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">2.</span> In his letter to Engels of 1 February
1882, Becker proposed setting up a new international workers' organization
along the lines of the International Working Men's Association.</p>
<a id="n3"></a>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">3.</span> Under the law proposed by the Minister
of Justice Dufaure, and passed by the French National Assembly on 14 March
1872, membership of the International was punished by imprisonment.</p>
<a id="n4"></a>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">4.</span> In May-August 1881, Engels contributed

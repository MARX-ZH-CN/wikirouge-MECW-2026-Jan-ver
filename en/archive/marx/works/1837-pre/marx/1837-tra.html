<p class="verse">Mine eyes are so confused,<br>
    My cheek it is so pale,<br>
My head is so bemused,<br>
    A realm of fairy-tale.</p>
<p class="verse">I wanted, boldly daring,<br>
    Sea-going ways to follow,<br>
Where a thousand crags rise soaring,<br>
    And Floods flow bleak and hollow.</p>
<p class="verse">I clung to Thought high-soaring,<br>
    On its two wings did ride,<br>
And though storm winds were roaring,<br>
    All danger I defied.</p>
<p class="verse">I did not falter there,<br>
    But ever on did press<br>
With the wild eagle’s stare<br>
    On journeys limitless.</p>
<p class="verse">And though the Siren spins<br>
    Her music so endearing<br>
Whereby the heart she wins --<br>
    I gave that sound no hearing.</p>
<p class="verse">I turned away mine ear<br>
    From the sweet sounds I heard,<br>
My bosom did aspire<br>
    To a loftier reward.</p>
<p class="verse">Alas, the waves sped on,<br>
    At rest they would not be;<br>
There swept by many a one<br>
    Too swift for me to see.</p>
<p class="verse">With magic power and word<br>
    I cast what spells I knew,<br>
But forth the waves still roared,<br>
    Till they were gone from view.</p>
<p class="verse">And by the Flood sore pressed,<br>
    And dizzy at the sight,<br>
I tumbled from that host<br>
    Into the misty night.</p>
<p class="verse">And when I rose again<br>
    From fruitless toil at last,<br>
My powers all were gone,<br>
    And all the heart’s glow lost</p>
<p class="verse">And trembling, pale, I long<br>
    Gazed into my own breast;<br>
By no uplifiting song<br>
    Was my affliction blessed.</p>
<p class="verse">My songs were flown, alack;<br>
    The sweetest Art was gone --<br>
No God would give it back <br>
    Nor Grace of Deathless One.</p>
<p class="verse">The Fortress had sunk down<br>
    That once so bold did stand;<br>
The fiery glow was drowned,<br>
    Void was the bosom’s land.</p>
<p class="verse">Then shone your radiance,<br>
    The purest light of soul,<br>
Where in a changing dance<br>
    Round Earth the Heavens roll.</p>
<p class="verse">Then was I captive bound,<br>
    Then was my vision clear,<br>
For I had truly found<br>
    What my dark strivings were.</p>
<p class="verse">Soul rang more strong, more free,<br>
    Out of the deep-stirred breast<br>
In triumph heavenly,<br>
    And in sheer happiness.</p>
<p class="verse">My spirits then and there<br>
    Soared, jubilant and gay,<br>
And, like a sorcerer,<br>
    Their courses did I sway. </p>
<p class="verse">I left the waves that rush,<br>
    The floods that change and flow,<br>
On the high cliff to crash,<br>
    But saved the inner glow.</p>
<p class="verse">And what my Soul, Fate-driven<br>
    Never in flight o'ertook,<br>
That to my heart was given,<br>
    Was granted by your look.<br>

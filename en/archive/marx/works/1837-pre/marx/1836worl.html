<p class="verse">Worlds my longing cannot ever still,  <br>
    Nor yet Gods with magic blest; <br>
Higher than them all is my own Will, <br>
    Stormily wakeful in my breast. </p>
<p class="verse">Drank I all the stars’ bright radiance, <br>
    All the light by suns o'erspilled, <br>
Still my pains would want for recompense, <br>
    And my dreams be unfulfilled. </p>
<p class="verse">Hence! To endless battle, to the striving <br>
    Like a Talisman out there, <br>
Demon-wise into the far mists driving <br>
    Towards a goal I cannot near. </p>
<p class="verse">But it’s only ruins and dead stones <br>
    That encompass all my yearning, <br>
Where in shimmering Heavenly radiance <br>
    All my hopes flow, ever-burning. </p>
<p class="verse">They are nothing more than narrow rooms <br>
    Ringed by timid people round, <br>
Where it stands, the frontier of my dreams, <br>
    Where my hopes reach journey’s end. </p>
<p class="verse">Jenny, can you ask what my words say, <br>
    And what meaning hides within? <br>
Ah! ‘Twere useless to speak anyway, <br>
    Futile even to begin. </p>
<p class="verse">Look into those eyes of yours so bright, <br>
    Deeper than the floor of Heaven, <br>
Clearer than the sun’s own beaming light, <br>
    And the answer shall be given. </p>
<p class="verse">Dare to joy in life and being fair, <br>
    Only press your own white hand; <br>
You yourself shall find the answer there, <br>
    Know my distant Heaven-land. </p>
<p class="verse">Ah! When your lips only breathed to me, <br>
    Only one warm word to say, <br>
Then I dived into mad ecstasy, <br>
    Helpless I was swept away. </p>
<p class="verse">Ha! In nerve and spirit I was stricken, <br>
    To the bottom of my soul, <br>
As a Demon, when the High Magician <br>
    Strikes with lightning bolt and spell. </p>
<p class="verse">Yet why should words try to force in vain, <br>
    Being sound and misty pall, <br>
What is infinite, like yearning’s pain, <br>
    Like yourself, and like the All. </p>

<h1>The Pale Maiden</h1>
<h3>A Ballad</h3>
<p class="fst">
The maiden stands so pale, <br>
So silent, withdrawn, <br>
Her sweet angelic soul <br>
Is misery-torn.</p>
<p class="fst">
Therein can shine no ray, <br>
The waves tumble over; <br>
There, love and pain both play, <br>
Each cheating the other.</p>
<p class="fst">
Gentle was she, demure, <br>
Devoted to Heaven, <br>
An image ever pure<br>
The Graces had woven.</p>
<p class="fst">
Then came a noble knight, <br>
A grand charger he rode; <br>
And in his eyes so bright <br>
A sea of love flowed.</p>
<p class="fst">
Love smote deep in her breast,<br>
But he galloped away, <br>
For battle-triumph athirst; <br>
Naught made him stay.</p>
<p class="fst">
All peace of mind is flown, <br>
The Heavens have sunk.<br>
The heart, now sorrow's throne, <br>
Is yearning-drunk.</p>
<p class="fst">
And when the day is past, <br>
She kneels on the floor, <br>
Before the holy Christ <br>
A-praying once more.</p>
<p class="fst">
But then upon that form <br>
Another encroaches, <br>
To take her heart by storm, <br>
'Gainst her self reproaches.</p>
<p class="fst">
"To me your love is given <br>
For Time unending.<br>
To show your soul to Heaven <br>
Is merely pretending."</p>
<p class="fst">
She trembles in her terror <br>
Icy and stark, <br>
She rushes out in horror, <br>
Into the dark.</p>
<p class="fst">
She wrings her lily-white hands, <br>
The tear-drops start. <br>
"Thus fire the bosom brands <br>
And longing, the heart.</p>
<p class="fst">
"Thus Heaven I've forfeited,<br>
    I know it full well. <br>
    My soul, once true to God,<br>
    Is chosen for Hell.</p>
<p class="fst">
He was so tall, alas, <br>
Of stature divine. <br>
His eyes so fathomless, <br>
So noble, so fine.</p>
<p class="fst">
"He never bestowed on me <br>
His glances at all; <br>
Lets me pine hopelessly<br>
    Till the end of the Soul.</p>
<p class="fst">
"Another his arm may press, <br>
May share his pleasure; <br>
Unwitting, he gives me distress <br>
Beyond all measure.</p>
<p class="fst">
"With my soul willingly, <br>
With my hopes I'd part, <br>
Would he but look towards me <br>
And open his heart.</p>
<p class="fst">
"How cold must the Heavens be <br>
Where he doesn't shine, <br>
A land full of misery<br>
    And burning with pain.</p>
<p class="fst">
"But here the surging flood <br>
May deliver me, cooling <br>
The hot fire of heart's blood, <br>
The bosom's feeling."</p>
<p class="fst">
She leaps with all her might <br>
Into the spray. <br>
Into the cold dark night <br>
She's carried away.</p>
<p class="fst">
Her heart, that burning brand, <br>
Is quenched forever; <br>
Her look, that luminous land, <br>
Is clouded over.</p>
<p class="fst">
Her lips, so sweet and tender, <br>
Are pale and colourless; <br>
Her form, aethereal, slender, <br>
Drifts into nothingness.</p>
<p class="fst">
And not a withered leaf <br>
Falls from the bough; <br>
Heaven and Earth are deaf, <br>
Won't wake her now.</p>
<p class="fst">
By mountain, valley, on <br>
The quiet waves race, <br>
To dash her skeleton <br>
On a rocky place.</p>
<p class="fst">
The Knight so tall and proud <br>
Embraces his new love, <br>
The cithern sings about <br>
The joys of True Love!</p>

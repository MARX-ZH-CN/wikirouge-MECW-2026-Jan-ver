<h1>The Little Old Man of the Water</h1>
<h3>A Ballad</h3>
<p class="fst">
The waters rush with an eerie sound,<br>
The waves are swirling round and round.<br>
They seem to feel no pain at all,<br>
As they break and fall,<br>
Cold of heart, cold of mind,<br>
Rushing, rushing all the time.</p>
<h5>2</h5>
<p class="fst">
But down in the depths where the waters rage<br>
Sits a mannikin, white with age.<br>
He dances about when the Moon appears,<br>
When little star through cloudlet peers.<br>
Eerily hopping and skipping, he'd try<br>
To drink the little streamlet dry.</p>
<h5>3</h5>
<p class="fst">
Waves are his murderers, every one,<br>
They gnaw his ancient skeleton,<br>
It cuts through his marrow and limb like ice<br>
To see them gambol in this wise;<br>
His face is a grimace of sorrow and gloom<br>
Till sunshine stops the dance of the Moon.</p>
<h5>4</h5>
<p class="fst">
The waters then rush with an eerie sound,<br>
The waves are swirling round and round.<br>
They seem to feel no pain at all,<br>
As they break and fall,<br>
Cold of heart, cold of mind,<br>
Rushing, rushing all the time.</p>

<h3> I.<br>
The Fiddler</h3>
<p class="fst">
The Fiddler saws the strings,<br>
His light brown hair he tosses and flings.<br>
    He carries a sabre at his side,<br>
    He wears a pleated habit wide.</p>
<p class="fst">
"Fiddler, why that frantic sound?<br>
Why do you gaze so wildly round?<br>
    Why leaps your blood, like the surging sea?<br>
    What drives your bow so desperately?"</p>
<p class="fst">
"Why do I fiddle? Or the wild waves roar?<br>
That they might pound the rocky shore,<br>
    That eye be blinded, that bosom swell,<br>
    That Soul's cry carry down to Hell."</p>
<p class="fst">
"Fiddler, with scorn you rend your heart.<br>
A radiant God lent you your art,<br>
    To dazzle with waves of melody,<br>
    To soar to the star-dance in the sky."</p>
<p class="fst">
"How so! I plunge, plunge wihout fail<br>
My blood-black sabre into your soul.<br>
    That art God neither wants nor wists,<br>
    It leaps to the brain from Hell's black mists. </p>
<p class="fst">
"Till heart's bewitched, till senses reel:<br>
With Satan I have struck my deal.<br>
    He chalks the signs, beats time for me,<br>
    I play the death march fast and free.</p>
<p class="fst">
"I must play dark, I must play light,<br>
Till bowstrings break my heart outright."</p>
<p class="fst">
The Fiddler saws the strings,<br>
His light brown hair he tosses and flings.<br>
    He carries a sabre at his side,<br>
    He wears a pleated habit wide.</p>
<h3>II<br>
Nocturnal Love</h3>
<p class="fst">
 Frantic, he holds her near,<br>
    Darkly looks in her eye.<br>
 "Pain so burns you, Dear,<br>
    And at my breath you sigh.</p>
<p class="fst">
 "Oh, you have drunk my soul.<br>
    Mine is your glow, in truth.<br>
 My jewel, shine your fill.<br>
    Glow, blood of youth."</p>
<p class="fst">
 "Sweetest, so pale your face,<br>
    So wondrous strange your words.<br>
 See, rich in music's grace<br>
    The lofty gliding worlds."</p>
<p class="fst">
 "Gliding, dearest, gliding,<br>
    Glowing, stars, glowing.<br>
 Let us go heavenwards riding,<br>
    Our souls together flowing."</p>
<p class="fst">
 His voice is muffled, low.<br>
    Desparate, he looks about.<br>
 Glances of crackling flame<br>
    His hollow eyes shoot out.</p>
<p class="fst">
 "You have drunk poison, Love.<br>
    With me you must away.<br>
 The sky is dark above,<br>
    No more I see the day."</p>
<p class="fst">
 Shuddering, he pulls her close to him.<br>
    Death in the breast doth hover.<br>
 Pain stabs her, piercing deep within,<br>
    And eyes are closed forever.</p>

<h1>The Song of a Sailor at Sea</h1>
<p class="fst">
You may frolic and beat and roll <br>
Round my boat just as you will, <br>
You must carry me to my goal; <br>
For you are my subjects still.</p>
<p class="fst">
Blue waves beneath that now, <br>
My little brother's there. <br>
You dragged him down below, <br>
His bones became your fare.</p>
<p class="fst">
I was a boy, no more;<br>
     Once rashly he cast off, <br>
     He seized hold of the oar, <br>
     Sank by a sandy reef.</p>
<p class="fst">
I vowed a vow so true<br>
     By the waves of the briny sea, <br>
     I'd be revenged on you, <br>
     Lash you relentlessly.</p>
<p class="fst">
Soul's oath and word I've kept, <br>
Them I have not betrayed. <br>
I've whipped you and I've whipped, <br>
On land have seldom stayed.</p>
<p class="fst">
When booms the stormy main, <br>
The bell rocks in the tower, <br>
When blows the hurricane, <br>
When raging winds do roar,</p>
<p class="fst">
I'm driven from my bed,<br>
    From seat secure and warm, <br>
    From cosy quiet homestead,<br>
    To sail through wind and storm.</p>
<p class="fst">
With wind and wave I fight, <br>
To the Lord God I pray, <br>
And let the sails fill out;<br>
     A true star guides my way.</p>
<p class="fst">
New strength comes, with the breath <br>
Of joy and ecstasy, <br>
And in the game of death<br>
     Song from the breast bursts free.</p>
<p class="fst">
You may frolic and beat and roll <br>
Round my boat just as you will, <br>
You must carry me to my goal; <br>
For you are my subjects still.</p>

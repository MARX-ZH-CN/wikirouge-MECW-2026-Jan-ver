<h1>Harmony</h1>
<p class="fst">
Know you that magic image sweet<br>
When souls into each other go,<br>
And then in one soft breath outflow,<br>
Melodious, loving, mild, replete?<br>
They flame up in one rose-bloom, blushing red,<br>
And coyly hide deep in some mossy bed.</p>
<p class="fst">
Roam far and wide throughout the land,<br>
The magic image you'll not find<br>
That talisman can never bind,<br>
Nor sun's fierce rays portend.<br>
The light of no sun ever gave it birth,<br>
It never knew the nourishment of Earth.</p>
<p class="fst">
Ever resplendent there it stays,<br>
Though Time its rapid pinions beats,<br>
Though bright Apollo guides his steeds,<br>
Though worlds fade into nothingness.<br>
Alone its own true power did it create<br>
That neither world nor God can dominate.</p>
<p class="fst">
Perhaps 'tis like the Cithern sounding,<br>
As played on one eternal Lyre,<br>
In endless glow, in endless fire,<br>
In yearning's lofty urge resounding.<br>
Once hear within yourself those strings that play<br>
Your steps to wander shall not further stray.</p>

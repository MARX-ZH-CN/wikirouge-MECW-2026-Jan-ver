<h1>Dialogue with ...</h1>
<p class="fst">
A Singer stands in festive attire,<br>
Clasps to his bosom warm a lyre,<br>
And plucks the strings, enraptured.<br>
"How play you my tunes, how sing my refrains,<br>
How swell you, O Lyre, with soul that strains<br>
As if by your own fires captured?"</p>
<p class="fst">
"Singer, think you that I am cold<br>
To bosom's light, to yearning soul,<br>
To images upwards striving?<br>
They shine as clear as the Land of Stars,<br>
They surge, they soar like streaming fires,<br>
They lead to a Loftier Living.</p>
<p class="fst">
"I knew with prescience profound<br>
When called by your Word's sparkling sound,<br>
Twas not your fingers touching.<br>
It was a breath from sweeter lips<br>
Uprising from the heart's own depths,<br>
A subtler music teaching.</p>
<p class="fst">
"There shone a visage wondrous fair,<br>
Haloed in song, in golden hair,<br>
That flashed forth rarest lays.<br>
High beat her heart, eyes glowed sublime,<br>
You were no more, you sank in dream,<br>
And I must honour and praise.</p>
<p class="fst">
"Her image in me sank silently,<br>
Like flower-shine rose out of me,<br>
As melting into sound.<br>
But say, it falls, it soars again,<br>
And yet for you cloud-veiled remain<br>
The sun and stars all round."</p>
<p class="fst">
"O wondrous Lyre of magic skill,<br>
Your joy's like bubbling founts that well,<br>
Ringed round with May-wreaths fair.<br>
Her breath inspires, her eyes invite,<br>
Your tones vibrate, your light beams bright,<br>
And rolls with the dancing spheres.</p>
<p class="fst">
"One drinks, one sings of raptures blest,<br>
Then Love flees echoing from the breast,<br>
One's spirits no more sound.<br>
Yours was the dream, yours was the life,<br>
You shine in her, afar I strive,<br>
You soar, I must bow down."</p>
<p class="fst">
"Singer, though lulled by flower-dream,<br>
I too reach out to Heaven's hem<br>
With golden stars to bind it.<br>
The music sounds, life is in tears,<br>
The music sounds, the sun shines clear,<br>
And distances are blended."</p>

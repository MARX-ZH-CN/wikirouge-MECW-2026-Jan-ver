<h1>Man and Drum</h1>
<p class="fst">
<h3>A Fable</h3>
<p class="fst">
A Drum it is no Man, and a Man he is no Drum,<br>
The Drum is very clever, and the Man is very dumb.</p>
<p class="fst">
The Drum is tied with straps, but the Man is on his own,<br>
And the Drum sits firm when the Man falls down.</p>
<p class="fst">
The angry Man he beats it, and the Drum goes bippety-bop,<br>
Yes, the merry Drum it rattles, and the Man goes hippety-hop.</p>
<p class="fst">
And then the Man pulls faces, and the Drum it laughs at him,<br>
And the Man shouts up and down the house and makes an awful din.</p>
<p class="fst">
"Hey, Drum, he, Drum, why laugh so mockingly?<br>
You take me for a fool and you stick out your tongue at me!</p>
<p class="fst">
"Damn you, Drum, you shame me, you jeer and you deride!<br>
Why d'you rattle when I beat, why d'you hang where you were tied?</p>
<p class="fst">
"You think I raised you from a tree into a Drum full-grown<br>
To carry on like that as if you'd done it on your own?</p>
<p class="fst">
"You shall dance when I beat, you shall beat when I sing,<br>
You shall cry when I laugh, you shall laugh when I spring."</p>
<p class="fst">
The Man scowls at the Drum all in a sudden furious bout,<br>
He bangs and bangs and bangs it till its blood comes gushing out</p>
<p class="fst">
So the Drum it has no Man, and the Man he has no Drum,<br>
And the Man takes holy orders for a friar to become.</p>

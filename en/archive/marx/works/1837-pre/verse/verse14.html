<h1>Two Singers Accompanying Themselves on the Harp</h1>
<h3>A Ballad</h3>
<p class="fst">
"What brings you to this Castle here<br>
To breathe Song's radiant aureole?<br>
Seek you a loving comrade dear<br>
    For whom in longing yearns your soul?"</p>
<p class="fst">
"Know you him who soulful dwells therein,<br>
Ask you if he set my heart a-burning?<br>
Can you tell me if the sight of him<br>
    Ever favoured mortals drawn by yearning?</p>
<p class="fst">
"Never have I seen that shine of his,<br>
Yet the gleam of precious stone<br>
Burning on that splendid edifice<br>
Surely needs must lure me on.</p>
<p class="fst">
"Truly, it might be my place of birth,<br>
Here might be my native land.<br>
Ah! 'twas chosen by the gentle South,<br>
Turned towards the glow it stands.</p>
<p class="fst">
"Here my melody more free resounds,<br>
And my breast the higher swells.<br>
Sweet the golden Lyre's music sounds,<br>
As in joy of grief it wells.</p>
<p class="fst">
"And I do not know that High Master,<br>
Him who strikes the heart-strings powerfully,<br>
Nor the heavenly spirits that the<br>
Castle<br> Harbours in its womb so secretly.</p>
<p class="fst">
"And in vain is my desire's hot burning,<br>
Not for me the fair gates opening.<br>
I lean on the columns, sadly yearning,<br>
Here Love's tribute I must sing!"</p>
<p class="fst">
In despair her jet black hair she shakes,<br>
Bursts into a flood of tears,<br>
And the other kisses dry her cheeks,<br>
Clasps her to her bosom's warming fires.</p>
<p class="fst">
"I too am drawn by secret bonds<br>
To this divine and holy fane.<br>
I quested wandering through the lands,<br>
Was pierced, as if by lightning's flame.</p>
<p class="fst">
"But why the burning dew so spill,<br>
The tears of bitter sorrow weep?<br>
We may enjoy the view at will,<br>
    On flowery meadow dance and leap!</p>
<p class="fst">
"The heart may glow more full in us,<br>
And sorrow may more sweetly come.<br>
The looks may shine more luminous,<br>
Here the Most Beautiful's soon won!</p>
<p class="fst">
"A humble cottage let us find<br>
    Where we our songs of praise may sing,<br>
Where the sweet West may play around<br>
In spirits' secret struggling."</p>
<p class="fst">
Full many a day they lingered there,<br>
At eventide the strings were heard<br>
That held entranced with sad allure<br>
Full many a flower and many a bird.</p>
<p class="fst">
Once, as they both lay fast asleep,<br>
Arms clasped the gentle bodies round<br>
On bed of moss full soft and deep,<br>
A Demon wondrous tall was found.</p>
<p class="fst">
He bore them up on wings of gold;<br>
They were as bound in magic bonds,<br>
And where that cottage stood of old<br>
A wondrous melody resounds.</p>

<h1>Epigrams</h1>
<table align="center" width="70%"><tr><td>
<h5>I</h5>
<p class="fst">
In its armchair, stupid and dumb,<br>
   The German public watches it come.<br>
Hither and thither rumbles the storm,<br>
Heaven clouds over, more dark and forlorn.</p>
<p class="fst">
Lightning hisses, snakes out of sight,<br>
Feelings remain inviolate.<br>
But when the sun comes out in greeting,<br>
The winds soft sighing, the storm abating,<br>
It stirs itself, makes a fuss at last,<br>
And writes a book: <i>The Commotion Is Past;</i><br>
Is seized with an urge for fantasy,<br>
Would plumb the whole thing thoroughly;<br>
Believes it's extremely wrong of Heaven<br>
To play such jokes, though brilliant even,<br>
It should the All systematically treat;<br>
First rub the head and then the feet;<br>
Just like a baby it carries on<br>
    Looking for things which are dead and gone;<br>
Should get the Present in proper perspective,<br>
Let Heaven and Earth go their ways respective;<br>
They've followed their courses as before,<br>
And the wave laps quiet on the rocky shore.</p>

<h3>II<br>
On Hegel</h3>
<h5>1</h5>
<p class="fst">
Since I have found the Highest of things and the Depths of them also,<br>
Rude am I as a God, cloaked by the dark like a God.<br>
Long have I searched and sailed on Thought's deep billowing ocean ;<br>
     There I found me the Word: now I hold on to it fast.
<h5>2</h5>
<p class="fst">
Words I teach all mixed up into a devilish muddle,<br>
Thus, anyone may think just what he chooses to think;<br>
Never, at least, is he hemmed in by strict limitations.<br>
     Bubbling out of the flood, plummeting down from the cliff,<br>
So are his Beloved's words and thoughts that the Poet devises;<br>
<i>He</i> understands what he thinks, freely invents what he feels.<br>
Thus, each may for himself suck wisdom's nourishing nectar;<br>
Now you know all, since I've said plenty of nothing to you!</p>
<h5>3</h5>
<p class="fst">
Kant and Fichte soar to heavens blue<br>
Seeking for some distant land,<br>
I but seek to grasp profound and true<br>
That which--in the street I find.</p>
<h5>4</h5>
<p class="fst">
Forgive us epigrammatists<br>
For singing songs with nasty twists.<br>
In Hegel we're all so completely submerged,<br>
But with his Aesthetics we've yet to be-<br>
purged.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p class="fst">
The Germans once actually stirred their stumps,<br>
With a People's Victory turned up trumps.<br>
And when all that was over and done,<br>
On every corner, everyone<br> 
Read:<br>
"Wonderful things are in store for you<br>
Three legs for all instead of two!"<br>
This shook them badly, and in due course<br>
They were all smitten by deep remorse.<br>
"Too much has happened at once, it's plain.<br>
We'll have to behave ourselves again.<br>
The rest it were better to print and bind,<br>
And buyers will not be hard to find."</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p class="fst">
Pull down the stars for them at night,<br>
They burn too pale or far too bright.<br>
The sun's rays either scorch the eye<br>
Or shine from much too far away.
<h3>V</h3>
<p class="fst">
Of Schiller there's reason to complain,<br>
Who couldn't more humanly entertain.<br>
Endowed with an elevating mind,<br>
He didn't stick to the daily grind.<br>
He played with Thunder and Lightning much,<br>
But totally lacked the common touch.</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p class="fst">
But Goethe's taste was too nicely ordered;<br>
He'd rather see Venus than something sordid.<br>
Although he grasped things, as one should, from below,<br>
It was for the Highest he made us go.<br>
He wanted to make things so sublime<br>
That Soul-grip evaded him most of the time.<br>
Schiller was surely nearer the mark,<br>
You can read his ideas in letters stark.<br>
His thoughts are there in black and white,<br>
Though it's hard to fathom the meaning aright.</p>
<a id="7"></a>
<h3>VII<br>
On a Certain Bald-Head</h3>
<p class="fst">
As lightning born of radiancy<br>
Sparkles from cloud-realms far away,<br>
Pallas Athena victorious<br>
    Sprang from the thought-filled head of Zeus.<br>
Even so, in sportiveness unbounded,<br>
On to his head she's likewise bounded,<br>
And what in depth he could never plumb<br>
Visibly shines on his cranium.</p>
<a id="8"></a>
<h3>VIII<br>
Pustkuchen (False Wandering Years)</h3>
<h5>1</h5>
<p class="fst">
Schiller, thinks he, had been less of a bore<br>
If only he'd read the Bible more.<br>
One could have nothing but praise for <i>The Bell</i><br>
If it featured the Resurrection as well,<br>
Or told how, on a little ass,<br>
Christ into the town did pass;<br>
While David's defeat of the Philistine<br>
Would have added something to <i>Wallenstein</i>.</p>
<h5>2</h5>
<p class="fst">
Goethe can give the ladies a fright,<br>
For elderly women he's not quite right.<br>
He understood Nature, but this is the quarrel,<br>
 He wouldn't round Nature off with a moral.<br>
He should have got Luther's doctrine off pat<br>
And made up his poetry out of that.<br>
He had beautiful thoughts, if sometimes odd,<br>
But omitted to mention--"Made by God"</p>
<h5>3</h5>
<p class="fst">
Extremely strange is this desire<br>
To elevate Goethe higher and higher.<br>
How low in actual fact his reach-<br>
Did he ever give us a sermon to preach?<br>
Show me in Goethe solid ground<br>
For Peasant or Pedagogue to expound.<br>
Such a genius marked with the stamp of the Lord<br>
That a sum in arithmetic had him floored.</p>
<h5>4</h5>
<p class="fst">
Hear Faust in the full authentic version;<br>
The Poet's account is sheer perversion.<br>
Faust was up to his ears in debts,<br>
Was dissolute, played at cards for bets.<br>
No offer of help from above was extended,<br>
So he wanted it all ignominiously ended.<br>
But was overwhelmed by a fearful sensation<br>
Of Hell and the anguish of desperation.<br>
He then devoted due reflection<br>
To Knowledge, Deed, Life, Death, and Perdition; <br>
And on these topics had much to say<br>
In a darkly mystical sort of way.<br>
Couldn't the Poet have managed to tell<br>
How debts lead man to the Devil and Hell.<br>
Who loses his credit may well conceivably<br>
Forfeit redemption quite irretrievably.
<h5>5</h5>
<p class="fst">
Since Faust at Easter had the gall<br>
To think, why trouble the Devil at all?<br>
Who dares to think on Easter Day<br>
Is doomed to Hell-fire anyway.</p>
<h5>6</h5>
<p class="fst">
 Credibility too is defied.<br>
   The Police would soon have had enough!<br>
They'd surely have had him clapped inside<br>
For running up debts and making off!</p>
<h5>7</h5>
<p class="fst">
 Vice alone could elevate Faust,<br>
Who really loved himself the most.<br>
God and the World he dared to doubt,<br>
Moses thought they'd both worked out.<br>
Silly young Gretchen had to adore him<br>
Instead of getting his conscience to gnaw him,<br>
Telling him he was the Devil's prey,<br>
And the Day of Judgment was well on the way.
<h5>8</h5>
<p class="fst">
There's use for the "Beautiful Soul" It's simple:<br>
Just trim it with specs and a nun's wimple.<br>
"What God hath done is right well done,"<br>
Thus the true Poet hath begun.</p>
<a id="puff"></a>
<h3>
Concluding Epigram on the Puff-Pastry Cook</h3>
<p class="fst">
So knead your cake as well as you can,<br>
You'll never be more than a baker's man.<br>
And, after all, whoever asked <i>you</i><br>
To emulate Goethe the way you do?<br>
As he knew nothing of your profession,<br>
Whence came his genius and perception?</p>

<h1>Evening Stroll</h1>
<p class="fst">
"Why gaze you towards the cliff-wail there,<br>
What do you softly sigh?"<br>
"The sun sinks glowing through the air,<br>
Kissing the cliff good-bye.</p>
<p class="fst">
"And this before you've never seen<br>
The sun's orb slowly scale<br>
The morning sky, and then from noon<br>
Sink down into the vale?"</p>
<p class="fst">
"Indeed I have, indeed that glow<br>
In crimson folds throbbed burning,<br>
Until its Eye, being loth to go,<br>
Dwelt on her in its yearning.</p>
<p class="fst">
"We walked in peace. By her footfall<br>
The echoing cliffs were captured.<br>
The light wind gently kissed her shawl,<br>
Soft spoke her eyes, enraptured.</p>
<p class="fst">
"And sick with love, I lisped a-sighing;<br>
She trembled, rosy red.<br>
I pressed her heart, down sank the dying<br>
Sun, star-cosseted.</p>
<p class="fst">
"That draws me to the cliff-wall there,<br>
That's what I softly sigh.<br>
She waves far off as evening fire,<br>
She bows as from on high."</p>

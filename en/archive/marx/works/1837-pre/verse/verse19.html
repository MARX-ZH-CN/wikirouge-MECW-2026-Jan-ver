<h1>Distraught</h1>
<h3>A Ballad</h3>
<h5>I</h5>
<p class="fst">
All decked with finery<br>
    She stands, in purple dressed;<br>
A satin ribbon coy<br>
    Is hidden in her breast.</p>
<p class="fst">
And playfully there glow<br>
Sweet roses in her hair,<br>
Some are like flakes of snow,<br>
The others--blood and fire.</p>
<p class="fst">
But never a rose is playing<br>
Upon her pallid face.<br>
She sinks, distressful, bowing,<br>
As hart shot in the chase.</p>
<p class="fst">
Tremulous, pale she looks<br>
In diamonds' full display.<br>
The blood drains from her cheeks<br>
Into her heart away.</p>
<p class="fst">
"I have been driven again<br>
To gaiety's false allure,<br>
My heart oppressed with pain,<br>
My wavering steps unsure.</p>
<p class="fst">
"O'er soul's high-billowing sea<br>
Other desires have called.<br>
Enough of this display,<br>
So loveless and so cold.</p>
<p class="fst">
"I cannot understand it,<br>
    Within my breast this flame;<br>
Heaven alone can grant it,<br>
 No mortal speak its name.<br>
<p class="fst">
"I would bear suffering even,<br>
Willingly I would die,<br>
That I might merit Heaven,<br>
A better land might see."
<p class="fst">
She lifts her tearful gaze<br>
To Heaven's radiance,<br>
Her bosom's fantasies<br>
    In sighs give utterance.</p>
<p class="fst">
Quietly she lays her down<br>
    And says a heartfelt prayer.<br>
Sleep folds her gently round,<br>
An angel watches her.</p>
<h5>II</h5>
<p class="fst">
Years have flown swiftly by,<br>
    Hollow her cheeks have grown.<br>
Quieter, sadder she,<br>
    More distant, more withdrawn.</p>
<p class="fst">
She struggles, but in vain,<br>
Fighting great agony,<br>
Those mighty powers to tame;<br>
Her heart leaps violently.</p>
<p class="fst">
Dreaming, one day she lies<br>
In bed, but not asleep,<br>
Drowning in nothingness...<br>
   The blow has struck full deep.</p>
<p class="fst">
Her look becomes a stare,<br>
   Hollow, and void, and numb.<br>
She raves, all unaware,<br>
In wild delirium.</p>
<p class="fst">
And from her eye there streams<br>
The blood that nothing stays.<br>
The pain now quieter seems,<br>
Now flash the Spirit's rays.
<p class="fst">
"The gates of Heaven yield,<br>
And I am moved with awe.<br>
My hopes shall be fulfilled,<br>
Nearer the stars I'll draw."</p>
<p class="fst">
Trembling on lips so pale,<br>
   The soul would seek to roam.<br>
The gentle spirits sail<br>
   To their aethereal home.</p>
<p class="fst">
Striving profound has drawn her,<br>
Lured by a magic bond.<br>
Too cold has life been for her,<br>
Too poor this earthly land.</p>

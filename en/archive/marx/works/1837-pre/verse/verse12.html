<h1>Lucinda</h1>
<h3>A Ballad</h3>
<p class="fst">
Life seems wed to gaiety<br>
     As the dancers tread the measure.<br>
Each feels chosen specially<br>
     For the sacred vows to pleasure.</p>
<p class="fst">
Rosy cheeks flush ever higher,<br>
     Faster still the heart's blood races,<br>
And the longings of desire<br>
     Lift the soul to heavenly places.</p>
<p class="fst">
Kiss fraternal and hearts' union<br>
Close all in a circle round,<br>
Gone the clash of rank, opinion,<br>
Love is lord and in command.</p>
<p class="fst">
But it is an idle dream<br>
     That enfolds warm hearts, and flies<br>
From this dust and earthly scene,<br>
Surging to aethereal skies.</p>
<p class="fst">
Gods can never bear to see<br>
Man, to his own folly blind,<br>
Blissfully believing he<br>
    May span Heaven with an Earth-born mind.
<p class="fst">
Through the lines a sombre guest<br>
Creeps with sword and knife, apart,<br>
Envy's fire consumes his breast,<br>
And disdain his wretched heart.</p>
<p class="fst">
She, now in the bridal wreath,<br>
Once was love and life to him;<br>
Pledged him once her solemn troth,<br>
And her heart she gave to him.</p>
<p class="fst">
So, to battle for the Good,<br>
     Trusting her, he went away,<br>
And his quest was crowned by Gods;<br>
Deed and valour won the day.</p>
<p class="fst">
Wreathed in glory, he returns<br>
To the township, quiet and still,<br>
Where his lovely jewel burns,<br>
Where desire and bliss do call.</p>
<p class="fst">
Now he sees the battlements,<br>
And his heart beats violently,<br>
Soon he shall win all he wants,<br>
Dream shall turn reality.</p>
<p class="fst">
To the threshold now he races<br>
Of the house that he loves so.<br>
Bright with many lamps it blazes,<br>
Guests are streaming to and fro.</p>
<p class="fst">
But the footman there, aloof,<br>
     Halts him with restraining hand.<br>
"Stranger, would you climb the roof?<br>
     Whither leads this rush so blind?"</p>
<p class="fst">
"Man, I seek Lucinda fair!"<br>
    Then the footman, open-eyed:<br>
"Anyone may find her here,<br>
For Lucinda is the bride!"</p>
<p class="fst">
Stunned, the stranger stands and sways<br>
     In his full athletic height,<br>
Stands with wide and staring eyes,<br>
Staggers up towards the gate.</p>
<p class="fst">
"You should look your festive best<br>
For this gay and brilliant place,<br>
If you want to be a guest!"<br>
     Calls the footman's uncouth voice.</p>
<p class="fst">
Proud and grim, he turns in haste,<br>
Takes the long-familiar way.<br>
Heart with rage and grief obsessed,<br>
Fury darting from his eye.</p>
<p class="fst">
To the place of his abode<br>
     Flies he like the storm wind rushing,<br>
And the door bursts open wide<br>
At his kicking and his pushing.</p>
<p class="fst">
Grabs the candle from the maid,<br>
Stays his hand, lest tremor show;<br>
With cold sweat the brow's bedewed<br>
That beats in silent woe.</p>
<p class="fst">
On his shoulders lets unfold<br>
     Cape of purple, wondrous fair,<br>
Decks himself with clasps of gold,<br>
Loosens and lets fall his hair.</p>
<p class="fst">
To his bosom's sanctuary<br>
     Presses he the gold-chased sword<br>
That he wielded to the glory<br>
Of the one whom he adored.</p>
<p class="fst">
Back he flies on wings of wind<br>
To the place of revelry,<br>
Heart beyond all bridling,<br>
     Deadly lightning in his eye.</p>
<p class="fst">
Trembling, steps he through the door<br>
To the brilliant hall within.<br>
Parcae name their victim, pour<br>
Curses hissing after him.</p>
<p class="fst">
Draws he nearer, sad and bowed,<br>
Prideful in his stately cloak.<br>
All the guests are frightened, cowed,<br>
By his awe-inspiring look.</p>
<p class="fst">
Like a ghost he seems to stride<br>
Lonely through the crowded hall.<br>
Onward still the partners glide,<br>
Foams the festive goblet full.</p>
<p class="fst">
Many dancers throng the rows,<br>
But Lucinda shines the best.<br>
From the filmy froth of gauze<br>
Swells voluptuous her breast.</p>
<p class="fst">
Each is filled with silent yearning,<br>
Gripped by power all-pervading,<br>
Longing all their eyes are turning<br>
On that form in beauty gliding.</p>
<p class="fst">
And her eyes, full of caprice,<br>
Laugh in undimmed radiance;<br>
On she moves with body's grace<br>
In the many-coloured dance.</p>
<p class="fst">
Past the man she lightly dances,<br>
Neither does he yield nor quail;<br>
Clouded are her glowing glances,<br>
And her rosy cheeks turn pale.</p>
<p class="fst">
She would mingle with the crowd,<br>
From the stranger turn away,<br>
But a scornful hiss is heard<br>
    And a God holds her in sway.</p>
<p class="fst">
Grim, he looks her up and down,<br>
Ominously closes on her.<br>
All the dancers, turned to stone,<br>
Questioningly eye each other.</p>
<p class="fst">
But Lucinda's throat and breathing<br>
Seem as if by Gods pressed tight.<br>
With her soul for respite striving,<br>
Clutches she her maid in fright.</p>
<p class="fst">
"Ha! So I must find you faithless,<br>
Who once pledged yourself to me,<br>
You, Lucinda, you a traitress,<br>
You another's bride I see!"</p>
<p class="fst">
Then the crowd would rush upon him<br>
For his conduct in that place,<br>
But he hurls the assailants from him,<br>
And like thunder sounds his voice.</p>
<p class="fst">
"Let no one dare interfere!"<br>
Menace in his eyes is plain.<br>
And all present, cowed, must hear,<br>
Listen to the voice of pain.</p>
<p class="fst">
"Never fear, I shall not harm her,<br>
She shall not be hurt this night.<br>
She need only watch the drama<br>
That I stage for her delight.</p>
<p class="fst">
"Let the dancing not be over,<br>
Carry on your revelry.<br>
Soon you shall embrace your lover,<br>
Soon you shall be free of me.</p>
<p class="fst">
"I, too, shall the nuptial bond<br>
Celebrate this eventide.<br>
But another way I've found-<br>
     Night and Blade shall be my bride.</p>
<p class="fst">
"From your eyes but let me suck<br>
 Sensuous passion, sensuous glow.<br>
Ah! Now I have seen your look;<br>
     You shall watch my life's blood flow!"</p>
<p class="fst">
Swiftly through him go the blades<br>
Long held ready in his hands,<br>
Snapped are all life's quivering threads,<br>
Darkness on his eyes descends.</p>
<p class="fst">
With a heavy crash he falls,<br>
Every muscle breaks in twain.<br>
Death his prideful limbs enfolds,<br>
And no God wakes him again.</p>
<p class="fst">
Then without a word she seizes<br>
Sword and dagger, quivering.<br>
With the iron her skin she pierces,<br>
And the purple life's blood springs.</p>
<p class="fst">
In a trice, the watchful maid,<br>
     Shuddering at the bloody spray,<br>
Wrests from her the deadly blade,<br>
Pulls the fatal steel away.</p>
<p class="fst">
Then in pain Lucinda sinks<br>
    On the corpse with grievous moan.<br>
From his heart the blood she drinks,<br>
To his heart lets flow her own.</p>
<p class="fst">
And the drapes of gauzy white<br>
That her slender body cover,<br>
Redden now with bloodstains bright,<br>
Frothing, bubbling all over.</p>
<p class="fst">
Long she moans there, hanging, clinging<br>
On to him who lies in death.<br>
He might live, if only longing<br>
     Soul back into clay could breathe.</p>
<p class="fst">
Pale and bloody then she rises<br>
From the one she chose at last.<br>
Slowly back the whole crowd presses,<br>
Murmuring, horror-struck, aghast.</p>
<p class="fst">
And a Goddess, tall, uprearing,<br>
Her own doom's artificer,<br>
Turns her gaze, destructive, searing,<br>
On the man who married her.</p>
<p class="fst">
And a smile, ice-cold and mocking,<br>
On the pale lips starts to play.<br>
Anguished wailing tells its shocking<br>
Tale of madness on the way.</p>
<p class="fst">
Broken up the merry revels,<br>
Fled the dancers, one and all,<br>
Silent now the clashing cymbals,<br>
Desolate the empty hall.</p>

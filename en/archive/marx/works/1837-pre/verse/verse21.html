<h3>ACT I</h3>
<p class="fst">
<i>A mountain town</i>
<p class="fst">
<h5>Scene 1<br>
<i>A street. Oulanem, Lucindo; Pertini before his house.</i></h5>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> Sirs, the whole town is crowded out with strangers, <br>Attracted to the spot by fame, to see <br>The wonders of the neighbourhood. In short, <br>I offer you my home. For at no inn <br>Will you find room. So all I can provide
<br>With my small means I shall be glad to place <br>At your disposal. Truly, I am drawn <br>To friendship with you. That's no flattery.
<p class="fst">
<i>Oulanem.</i> We thank you, stranger, and I only fear <br>Lest your opinion of us be too high.
<p class="fst"><i>Pertini.</i> Good ... good.... Then let us leave the compliments.
 <p class="fst"><i>Oulanem.</i> But we intend to make a lengthy stay.
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> Each day the less you spend in pleasure here <br>Will be my loss.
<p class="fst">
<i>Oulanem.</i> Once more we thank you warmly.
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini (calling a servant</i>).<br>
Boy! See the gentlemen up to their room. <br>They wish to take some rest after their journey; <br>They also want to be alone and change <br>Their heavy travelling clothes for lighter wear.
<p class="fst">
<i>Oulanem.</i> We take our leave, but we shall soon return.
<p class="fst">
<h5>(<i>Oulanem and Lucindo go out with the servant.</i>)<br>
<i>Pertini (alone, cautiously looking round)</i>.</h5>
<p class="fst">
It's he, by God, it's he; the day has come;<br>
He, the old friend I never could forget, <br>
Any more than my conscience gives me rest. <br>
That's excellent! Now I'll exchange my conscience; <br>
He shall be it henceforth, yes, he, Oulanem. <br>
So, conscience, now may it go well with you. <br>
For every night you stood before my bed, <br>
You went to sleep when I did, rose with me--<br>
We know each other, man, my eyes upon it! <br>
What's more, I know that there are others here; <br>
They are Oulanem also, also Oulanem! <br>
There's death rings in that name. Well, let it ring <br>
Till in its owner vile it rings its last. <br>
But wait, I have it now! As clear as air, <br>
Firm as my bones, it comes up from my soul. <br>
His oath stands up in arms before my eyes!<br>
I've found it, and I'll see he finds it too!<br>
My plan is made--you are its very soul, <br>
Yes, you, Oulanem, are its very life. <br>
Would you work Destiny as 'twere a puppet?<br>
Make Heaven a plaything for your calculations?<br>
Fabricate Gods out of your old spent loins?<br>
Now, play your part off pat, my little God; <br>
But wait--wait for your cue--leave that to me!</p>
<p class="fst">
<h5> <i>(Enter Lucindo.)</i></h5>
<h5> Scene 2<br>
<i>Pertini, Lucindo.</i></h5>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> Pray, why so much alone, my dear young sir?</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> Curiosity. The old find nothing new.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> Indeed! Your time of life!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> No, but if ever <br>My soul cherished a strong desire, if ever <br>My heart was moved by a presentient yearning, <br>It was to call him Father, be his son, <br>That one's whose manly and impassioned spirit <br>Can drink in worlds entire; whose heart streams forth <br>The radiance of the Gods. Did you not know him, <br>Then you might not conceive that such a man <br>Could be.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini. </i>It sounds indeed most fine and tender, <br>When from the warm voluptuous lips of youth <br>The praise of Age streams forth like tongues of fire. <br>It sounds so moral, like a Bible sermon, <br>Just like the story of the Dame Susannah, <br>Or like that tale about the Prodigal Son. <br>But dare I ask you if you know this man <br>With whom your heart would seem so closely bound?</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> Seem? Only semblance-- semblance and delusion?<br>
    You hate mankind?</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> Well, at the very least I am a man!<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo. </i>Forgive if I've offended.<br>
You are full well disposed towards the Stranger, <br>
And he who goes in friendship to the Wanderer,<br>
His spirit is not locked within itself. <br>
You seek an answer. Answer you shall have. <br>
We are together bound in a strange union <br>
Deep woven in the bottom of our hearts <br>
Which, even as bright blazing brands of fire, <br>
The spirits of his breast weave round with radiance, <br>
As if well-wishing Demons of the Light <br>
With thoughtful tenderness had matched us both. <br>
Thus have I known him since long, long ago--<br>
So long ago, that Memory scarcely whispers<br>
Of our first meeting. How we found each other, <br>
I know it not.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> It sounds indeed romantic.<br>
And yet, my dear young sir, it is but sound<br>
That sounds only to parry a request.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i> Lucindo. </i>I swear to it.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> What do you swear to, sir?</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> I do not know him, yet indeed I know him. <br>
He hides some mystery deep within his breast, <br>
Which I may not yet know--not now ... not yet ...<br>
These words repeat themselves each day, each hour.<br>
For see, I do not know myself!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> That's bad!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> I stand here so cut off, so separate. <br>The poorest wretch takes pride in what he is<br> When, smiling, he tells of the line that bore him, <br>Cherishing in his heart each little detail. <br>I cannot do this. Men call me Lucindo, <br>But they could call me gallows too, or tree.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> What do you want, then? Friendship with the gallows?<br>
Kinship, even? Well, I can help you there!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo (earnestly)</i>. Play not with empty syllables and sounds<br> When I rage inwardly.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini. </i>Rage on, my friend, <br>
Till rage is spent.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo (indignantly)</i>. What do you mean?</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> Mean? Nothing!<br>
I am a dry house philistine, no more, <br>
A man who simply calls each hour an hour, <br>
Who goes to sleep at night-time, just to rise <br>
When morning comes again; who counts the hours <br>
Until he's counted out and the clock stops, <br>
And worms become the hands that show the time; <br>
And so on till the final Judgment Day <br>
When Jesus, with the Angel Gabriel, <br>
Pronouncing sentence on his wrathful trumpet, <br>
Reads out the list of our recorded sins, <br>
And stands us on the right or on the left,<br>
And runs his God-fist over all our hides <br>
To find out whether we are lambs or wolves.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo. </i>He'll not name me, because I have no name.
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini. </i>Well said! That's how I like to hear you speak! <br>
But since I'm just a plain house philistine, <br>
My thoughts are homely, and I handle thoughts <br>
As you do stones and sand. So if a man <br>
Cannot name his own family, but turns <br>
Up with another, he's an off-shoot--born <br>
On the wrong side of the blanket.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> What was that?<br>
Think sooner black the sun and flat the moon, <br>
And neither sending forth one shaft of light, <br>
But here a sound--a surmise--and Life weighs it.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini. </i>My friend, you must not improvise so wildly. <br>
Believe me, I'm not prone to nervous fits! <br>
But off-shoots are quite often green and messy, <br>
Yes, yes, they take their own luxuriant way <br>
And shoot up shining towards the very Heavens, <br>
As if they knew that they had sprung from joy, <br>
Begotten by no dull and slavish union. <br>
For look you, off-shoots of this kind are satires; <br>
Nature's a Poet, Marriage sits in a chair, <br>
Its cap on, and with all the accessories, <br>
Its sullen face with grimacing distorted, <br>
And, lying at its feet, a dusty parchment <br>
Scrawled over with the parson's blasphemies, <br>
The church's dismal halls to give perspective, <br>
The churlish rabble gaping in the background-<br>
Give me off-shoots!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo (incensed)</i>. For God's sake, that's enough! <br>
What is it, man? What do you mean? Speak out; <br>
But by the Eternal I shall speak with you <br>
What do I ask? Lies it not clear before me,<br>
Grins not Hell out of it, does it not rise <br>
Before my look like Death's own withered shape, <br>
To glare at me and mutter threats of storm? <br>
But, man, not easily, believe you me, <br>
Have you hurled from your withered devil's fist <br>
This blazing brand of fire into my breast:<br>
For do not think you play dice with a boy, <br>
Flinging the dice with shattering force straight at <br>
His childish head. You've played too fast with me. <br>
So now--and mark you this--we're gaming comrades. <br>
You've quickly made yourself familiar. Out <br>
With all that's heaving in your vile snake's bosom!<br>
And be it mistrust only, or derision, <br>
Then I shall throw it back into your throat, <br>
And you yourself shall choke your poison down, <br>And then I'll play with you! But speak! I wish it!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> You do? You think of Faust and Mephistopheles.<br>
You've brooded on them deeply, I dare say. <br>
I tell you, no. Keep your wish to yourself, <br>
And I'll throw dust into its silly eyes.</p>
<br><p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> Take care. Don't blow upon the glowing embers <br>
Until the flames blaze up and you yourself <br>
Are burnt to cinders!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> A phrase! An empty phrase!<br>
The only one they burn will be yourself!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> Myself! So be it! To myself I'm nothing! <br>
But you, oh, you my youthful arms enfold <br>
And twine themselves in frenzy round your breast. <br>
The abyss yawns gaping night to both of us,<br>
If you sink down, smiling, I'll follow you,<br>
And whisper to you, "Down! Come with me! Comrade!"</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> It seems you're gifted with imagination.<br>
You have dreamed much already in your life?</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> Just so. I am a dreamer, yes, a dreamer.<br>
What knowledge do I want from you who have none?<br>
You've only seen us, but you know us not, <br>
Yet hurl against me scorn and blasphemy. <br>
What am I waiting for? Still more of you? <br>
You have no more ... but I have more for you. <br>
For me--guilt, poison, shame--you must redeem it. <br>
You've drawn the circle, and it leaves no room <br>
For two of us. Now use your jumping skill.<br>
    As Fate draws, so it draws. So let it be.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> You must have read that ending out in class <br>
From some dry, dusty hook of tragedies.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo. </i>True, this is tragedy that we are playing.<br>
Come on, now. Where and how you want. You choose.</p>
<p class="fst">
Pertini. And when, and everywhere, and any time, <br>
And none!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> Coward, don't make a mockery of my words, <br>
Or I'll write coward across your very face, <br>
And shout it out through each and every street <br>
And thrash you publicly, if you'll not follow, <br>
If you dare crack your feeble hackneyed jokes <br>
When my heart's blood runs cold within my veins. <br>
Not one word more; follow or do not follow, <br>
Your sentence is pronounced, you coward, you knave!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini (incensed)</i>. Say that again, boy! Say those words again!</p>
<p class="fst"> <i>Lucindo</i>. Why, if it brings you joy--a thousand times; <br>
If it stirs up your gall and sets it flowing <br>
Until the blood starts furious from your eyeballs,<br>
Then here it is again: you knave, you coward!</p>
<p class="fst"><i>Pertini.</i> We'll have this out. Write that upon your brain. <br>
There's still one place to knit us two together, <br>
And that is Hell--Hell not for me, but you!</p>
<p class="fst"><i>Lucindo.</i> Why count the syllables, if it can be settled <br>
Here on the spot. Then fly away to Hell, <br>
And tell the Devils it was I that sent you!</p>
<p class="fst"><i>Pertini.</i> Just one more word.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>Lucindo.</i> What is the use of words?<br>
I hear them not. Blow bubbles in the wind, <br>
Draw lineaments on your face to match your words, <br>
I see them not. Bring weapons, let them speak, <br>
I'll put my whole heart into them, and if <br>
It breaks not, then-</p>
<br><p class="fst"><i>Pertini (interrupting him)</i>.<br>
Not quite so bold, my lad, and not so callow! <br>
You, you have not a thing to lose, no, nothing! <br>
You are a stone that's fallen from the moon,<br>
That someone somewhere scratched one single word <br>
You spelled the letters out: they read "Lucindo". <br>
See! On that empty tablet I'll not dare <br>
Wager myself, my life, my honour, all. <br>
You want to use my blood for artist's colour? <br>
Am I to be the brush that lends you tone?<br>
We are too far removed in rank and station. <br>
Am I to stand against you as you are? <br>
I know what I am. Tell me, what are you? <br>
You know not, are not, you have naught to lose! <br>
Thief-like, you seek to pledge to me an honour <br>
That never in your bastard's bosom glowed?<br>
You seek to swindle, lay your empty ticket <br>
Against my sterling worth, my friend? <br>
Not so! First get you honour, name and life-<br>
You are still nothing--then I'll gladly stake <br>
My honour, name and life against your own!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> So that's it, coward! You want to save your skin?<br>
You've worked the sum out so ingeniously, <br>
Oh, so ingeniously, in your dull brain? <br>
Do not deceive yourself: I'll change your answer, <br>
And I shall write down "coward" in its place. <br>
I'll scorn you as I would a maddened beast; <br>
I'll shame you, yes, shame you before the world, <br>
And then you can explain, with all the details, <br>
To aunts and uncles, children, everyone, <br>
I call myself Lucindo, yes, Lucindo, <br>
That is my name; it might have been some other; <br>
I go by it, though it could have been different. <br>
What men call being, I do not possess; <br>
But you are what you are, and that's a coward!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> That's nice, that's very pretty. But supposing <br>
I could give you a name--you hear, a name?</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> You have no name yourself, and yet you'd give one, <br>
You who have never seen me, save this once; <br>
And seeing's a lie, the eternal mockery <br>
That hounds us down: we see, and that is all.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> Good. But who grasps more than is seen?</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo. </i>Not you.<br>
    You've seen in all things what you are: a scoundrel.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini. </i>True; I'm not easily fooled by the first glance.<br>
But that man--he was not born yesterday! <br>
Believe me, he has seen a thing or two.<br>
    What if we knew each other?</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> I don't believe it.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> But is there not a poet, wondrous strange,<br>
A gloomy aesthete, butt of ridicule, <br>
Who spends his hours in subtle meditation, <br>
Who would make rhymes of Life, and would most gladly <br>
Himself be author of the poem of Life?</p>
<p class="fst"> <i>Lucindo.</i> Ha! It might well be chance. You don't deceive me!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini. </i>Chance! Such is the language of philosophers <br>
When reason doesn't come to rescue them. <br>
Chance--it's so easily said--one syllable, <br>
A name is also chance. Anyone's name <br>
Might be Oulanem if he had no other.<br>
And so it is pure chance if I so call him.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> You know him? Heavens! Speak! In Heaven's name!</p>
<p class="fst"> <i>Pertini. </i>You know the boys' reward? Its name is--silence.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> It sickens me to ask of you a favour, <br>
But I beseech you, by all you hold dear!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> Dear? You think that I am going to bargain? <br>
A coward, you know, is deaf to all entreaty.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>Lucindo.</i> You must, then, if you would wipe out the taunt <br>
Of coward, you must speak without delay.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> Let's duel now, I'll fight you as you are.<br>
You're good enough for me, so let us fight.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> Don't drive me to the extreme, not to that verge <br>
Where there are no more bounds, where all things end.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini. </i>Listen to him! We want to try extremes, <br>
As Fate draws, so it draws. So let it be!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> Ha! Is there no way out, no hope at all? <br>
His breast as hard as iron, all feeling withered, <br>
Cankered and dried with scorn, he mixes poison <br>
And rubs it in for balsam. And he smiles. <br>
This may be your last hour, man, yes, your last, <br>
Seize it, absorb it, for in less than no time <br>
You'll stand before your Judge; so break the chain <br>
Of your life's vicious actions with one last, <br>
One last good deed, one solitary word, <br>
As lightly breathed as air!</p>
<br><p class="fst"> <i>Pertini.</i>'Twas chance, good friend.<br>
    Believe me, I believe in chance myself.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo. </i>In Vain! -- all-- all -- But stop, you shallow fool, <br>
It won't be settled that way, no, by God!<br>
Your sharp eye has deceived you once again. <br>
I'll call him here in person. Then you may stand, <br>
Before him, face to face and eye to eye,<br>
Just like a little boy caught doing wrong. <br>
You cannot hold me, man! Out of my way!</p>
<h5><i>(He rushes off.)</i></h5>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> A greater plan now rescues you, my lad; <br>Pertini can't forget, believe you me!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini (calls).</i> Lucindo, ho! In Heaven's name, come back!</p>
<h5><i> (Lucindo returns.)</i></h5>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> What would you? Off with you!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> There's honour for you!<br>
Go, tell the worthy gentleman we quarrelled; <br>
You challenged me, but being a good boy<br>
A good boy and a very pious child!-<br>
Repented, begged forgiveness, were forgiven. <br>
Then shed a pious tear, and kiss his hand, <br>
And cut the rod for your repentant back!</p>
<p class="fst"><i>Lucindo.</i> You drive me to it.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> You let yourself be driven.<br>
This sounds as moral as a children's primer.<br>
    Do you believe in God?</p>
<p class="fst"> <i>Lucindo.</i> Confess to you?</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> Don't you demand that I confess to you?<br>
I shall. But say, do you believe in God?</p>
<p class="fst"><i>Lucindo.</i> What's that to you?</p>
<br><p class="fst"> <i>Pertini.</i> It's hardly fashionable,<br>
So I'd much like to hear you tell me plainly.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>Lucindo.</i> I don't believe with what is called belief, <br>
And yet I know Him as I know myself.</p>
<br><p class="fst"><i>Pertini.</i> We'll talk of that when mood and moment suit; <br>
How you believe is all the same to me, <br>
At least you do believe. Good. Swear by Him.</p>
<br><p class="fst"> <i>Lucindo.</i> What? Swear to you?</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> Yes, swear you must that never <br>
Will your tongue blab a single syllable.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> By God, I swear it.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini. </i>Then swear you'll cherish only friendship for me.<br>
See, I am not so bad--only outspoken.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> By God, I would not swear it for a world <br>
That I loved you or held you in esteem. <br>
I cannot and I will not ever swear it, <br>
But what is past, let that be all wiped out <br>
As if it were a loathsome, evil dream.<br>
I'll plunge it down where all dreams disappear to, <br>
Deep in the rolling waves of oblivion. <br>
That I will swear to you by Him that's holy, <br>
From whom the worlds come whirling up through space, <br>
Who with His glance brings forth Eternity, <br>
I swear! But now the guerdon for my oath.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> Come! I will lead you to a quiet place, <br>
And show you many a sight: rocky ravines, <br>
Where lakes have welled up from volcanic Earth, <br>
Cradling in quietude their rounded waters; <br>
And where the years rush past in silent sequence, <br>
Then will the storm indeed subside, and then-</p>
<p class="fst"><i>Lucindo.</i> What's this? You speak of stones, bays, worms and mud? <br>
But rocks and crags tower upwards everywhere, <br>
In every spot a spring comes bubbling forth: <br>
Whether impetuous, low, high--what matter?<br>
Mysterious places still are to be found <br>
Where we are held enraptured and spellbound. <br>
To see them wakes excitement in my breast, <br>
And if it bursts, why, it is jest, no more. <br>
So take me where you will, yes, to that goal!<br>
Waver and falter not, but let's away!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> The rolling thunder first must cease its din <br>
Ere the pure lightning cleanse your breast within. <br>
So to a spot I'll make myself your guide <br>
Where, I much fear, you'll wish too long to abide.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> Oh, let our journey's goal lie where it may,<br>
I'll follow you, if you will lead the way.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> Mistrustful! (<i>They both go out.</i>)</p>
<h5>Scene 3<br>
A room in Pertini's house.<br>
<i>Oulanem is alone, seated at a table, writing. Papers lie about. Suddenly he springs up, walks zip and down, then stops abruptly and stands with folded arms.</i></h5>
<p class="fst">
<i>Oulanem.</i> All lost! The hour is now expired, and time <br>
Stands still. This pigmy universe collapses. <br>
Soon I shall clasp Eternity and howl <br>
Humanity's giant curse into its ear. <br>
Eternity! It is eternal pain, <br>
Death inconceivable, immeasurable! <br>
An evil artifice contrived to taunt us, <br>
Who are but clockwork, blind machines wound up <br>
To be the calendar-fools of Time; to be, <br>
Only that something thus at least might happen; <br>
And to decay, that there might be decay! <br>
The worlds must have had need of one thing more-<br>
Dumb, searing agony to send them whirling. <br>
Death comes to life and puts on shoes and stockings; <br>
The sorrowing plant, the stone's inert erosion, <br>
The birds that find no song to tell the pain <br>
Of their aethereal life, the general discord <br>
And the blind striving of the All to shake <br>
Itself out of itself, be crushed in quarrel-<br>
This now stands up and has a pair of legs, <br>
And has a breast to feel the curse of life! <br>
Ha, I must twine me on the wheel of flame, <br>
And in Eternity's ring I'll dance my frenzy! <br>
If aught besides that frenzy could devour,<br>
I'd leap therein, though I must smash a world <br>
That towered high between myself and it! <br>
It would be shattered by my long-drawn curse, <br>
And I would ding my arms around cruel Being, <br>
Embracing me,'twould silent pass away. <br>
Then silent would I sink into the void. <br>
Wholly to sink, not be--oh, this were Life, <br>
But swept along high on Eternity's current <br>
To roar out threnodies for the Creator, <br>
Scorn on the brow! Can Sun burn it away? <br>
Bound in compulsion's sway, curse in defiance!<br>
Let the envenomed eye flash forth destruction-<br>
Does it hurl off the ponderous worlds that bind? <br>
Bound in eternal fear, splintered and void, <br>
Bound to the very marble block of Being, <br>
Bound, bound forever, and forever bound!<br>
The worlds, they see it and go rolling on <br>
And howl the burial song of their own death. <br>
And we, we Apes of a cold God, still cherish <br>
With frenzied pain upon our loving breast <br>
The viper so voluptuously warm, <br>
That it as Universal Form rears up <br>
And from its place on high grins down on us! <br>
And in our ear, till loathing's all consumed, <br>
The weary wave roars onward, ever onward! <br>
Now quick, the die is cast, and all is ready; <br>
Destroy what only poetry's lie contrived, <br>
A curse shall finish what a curse conceived.<p class="fst">

<h5>Scene 4<br>
<i>Alwander's house; first-before the house. Lucindo, Pertini.</i></h5>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> Why bring me here?</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> For a succulent piece of woman, <br>
That's all! See for yourself, and if she softly <br>
Breathes a melodious peace into your soul, <br>
Then forward!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> What! You're taking me to whores?<br>
And at the very time when all of Life <br>
Comes down with crushing force upon my shoulders, <br>
And when my breast swells irresistibly <br>
In a mad frenzy craving self-destruction; <br>
When each breath breathes a thousand deaths for me,<br>
And now a woman!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> Ha! Rave on, young man, <br>
Breathe hellfire and destruction, breathe away! <br>
What whores? Did I misunderstand your meaning? <br>
See, there's the house. Does it look like a brothel? <br>
You think I want to play the pimp for you, <br>
And use the very daylight for a lantern?<br>
That's rich. But enter first and there, perhaps, <br>
You'll learn what you desire.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> I see your trick.<br>
The stuff you made it of is very cheap. <br>
You really seek to slip the hand that holds you. <br>
Be grateful that this moment I must hear you; <br>
But temporising will cost you your life.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>(They go into the house. The curtain falls and another is raised.<br>
A modern, elegant room.<br>
Beatrice is sitting on the sofa, a guitar beside her.<br>
Lucindo, Pertini, Beatrice.)</i></p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> Beatrice, a young traveller I bring, <br>A pleasant gentleman, my distant kinsman.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Beatrice (to Lucindo).</i> Welcome!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i> Lucindo.</i> Forgive me if I find no words, <br>
No speech to express my heart's astonishment. <br>
Beauty so rare quite overwhelms the spirits; <br>
The blood leaps high, but not a word will come.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Beatrice.</i> Fair words, young sir. You are in a pleasant mood. <br>
I thank your disposition, not the favour <br>
That Nature has denied me so unkindly,<br>
When 'tis your tongue that speaks, and not your heart.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>Lucindo</i>. Oh, if my heart might speak, if it might only <br>
Pour forth what you have quickened in its depths, <br>
The words would all be flames of melody, <br>
And every breath a whole eternity, <br>
A Heaven, an Empire infinitely vast, <br>
In which all lives would sparkle bright with thoughts <br>
Full of soft yearning, full of harmonies, <br>
Locking the World so sweetly in its breast, <br>
Streaming with radiance of pure loveliness, <br>
Since every word would only bear your name!</p>
<p class="fst"> <i>Pertini.</i> You will not take it in bad part, young lady, <br>
If I explain to you that he is German <br>
And always raves of Melody and Soul.</p>
<p class="fst"> <i>Beatrice</i>. A German! But I like the Germans well, <br>
And I am proud to be of that same stock. <br>
Come, sit here, German sir.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>(She offers him a place on the sofa.)</i></p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> Thank you, my lady.</p>
<p class="fst">(<i>Aside to Pertini.</i>)</p>
<p class="fst">Away! There is still time; here I am lost!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Beatrice (abashed)</i>. Did I speak out of place?</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>(Lucindo wants to speak, but Pertini cuts in.)</i></p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> Spare us your flourishes and your flattery!<br>
Twas nothing, Beatrice; merely some business <br>
That I must still arrange for him in haste.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo (confused, in a low voice)</i>.<br>
    By God, Pertini, you are playing with me!</p>
<p class="fst"><i>Pertini (aloud).</i>
Take it not so to heart, don't be so scared!<br>
The lady trusts my word, is it not so? <br>
Beatrice, he may stay, is it not so, <br>
Till I am back. And please remember--prudence;<br>
You are a stranger, so no foolishness.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Beatrice.</i> Oh, come, young sir, was then my welcome such <br>
That you could think I'd banish you, a stranger,<br>
Friend of Pertini, an old friend of ours,<br>
Unceremoniously from this house,<br>
Whose hospitable doors are open to all?<br>
    You need not flatter, but you must be fair.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> By God, your gracious kindness overwhelms me! <br>
You speak as gently as the angels speak. <br>
Forgive if overawed and overcome<br>
By the wild stream of passion long forgotten, <br>
The lips spoke what they ought to have concealed. <br>
Yet see the sky all clear and luminous <br>
Smile down upon us from the clouds' blue realm, <br>
And see the colours throb so sweet and bright, <br>
Now wrapped in shade and now in gentle light, <br>
Mingling in harmonies so soft and full, <br>
One lovely picture, one inspired soul.<br>
See this, and then be silent if your lips <br>
Obey. But no! your heart enchanted leaps, <br>
Prudence and circumspection vanished all. <br>
The lips must speak what holds your heart in thrall. <br>
Even as the Aeolian lyre is stirred to sound <br>
When Zephyr wraps his fluttering pinions round.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Beatrice.</i> Reproof I cannot find within my heart, <br>
You dress the poison, sir, with such sweet art.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo (aside to Pertini).</i><br>
Confounded villain, yet good villain too, <br>
What shall I do? Get out of here, by God!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini (aloud).</i><br>
It rankles in his mind, remembering how <br>
I took the words out of his mouth just now. <br>
In language beautiful he would have talked, <br>
When by my interruption he was balked. <br>
But never mind,'tis Beatrice's belief <br>
You kindly wished to afford her some relief <br>
From your grand talk; like any German jest, <br>
Once swallowed, it's not easy to digest.<br>
I go.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo (in a low voice).</i> But man! </p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini (aloud)</i>. Think of the sympathies <br>
That from the stomach to the heart soon rise; <br>
I'll soon be back to fetch you swift away, <br>
Or else in this sweet place too long you'll stay. <br>
<i>(Aside.)</i> I must be gone. And while he pays his court, <br>
I'll see the old man brings it all to naught.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>(Exit Pertini. Lucindo is in confusion.)</i></p>
<p class="fst"><i>Beatrice. </i>And must I yet once more bid you be seated?</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> I'll gladly sit here if you truly wish it.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>(Sits down.)</i></p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Beatrice.</i> Our friend Pertini's often strangely moody.
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> Yes, strangely so! Most strangely! Very strangely!
<p class="fst">
<i>(Pause.)</i></p>
<p class="fst">Forgive me, lady--you esteem this man!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Beatrice.</i> He has long been a true friend of the household,<br>
And always treated me most amiably. <br>
And yet -- I know not why -- I cannot bear him. <br>
He's often violent. Often from his breast-<br>
Forgive me, he's your friend--some secret spirit <br>
Calls strangely, in a voice I do not like. <br>
It is as though some inner turbulent darkness <br>
Shrank from the daylight's open look of love <br>
And feared to make response, as if he harboured<br>
An evil worse than his tongue speaks, worse even <br>
Than his heart dares to think. This is but surmise, <br>
And I do wrong, confiding it so soon; <br>
It is suspicion; suspicion is a viper.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> Do you regret confiding in me, then?</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Beatrice.</i> Were it a secret that concerned myself-<br>
But oh, what am I saying! Have you won <br>
My trust already? Yet it is not wrong <br>
That I should tell you everything I know; <br>
I could confide it all to anyone,<br>
    Since I know nothing that's not known to all.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> To all? Well said! You would be kind to all?</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Beatrice. </i>Would you not too?</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> O angel, O sweet being!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Beatrice.</i> You make me fearful, sir. What mean these words?<br>
You jump so suddenly from theme to theme!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i> Lucindo.</i> I must act quickly, for the hour is striking. <br>
Why hesitate? Death is in every minute. <br>
Can I conceal it? It's a miracle, <br>
I have just met you; strange though it appears, <br>
We might have known each other many years. <br>
It is as if the music I heard sound <br>
Within my own heart, living form had found, <br>
And into vibrant, warm reality <br>
The spirit-bond uniting us breaks free.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Beatrice. </i>I won't deny it: you are not to me <br>
A stranger, yet still strange you are, unknown. <br>
But as dark spirits would not let us see <br>
Each other till this hour, so we must own <br>
There may be other spirits whose deceit <br>
Binds us with treacherous bonds, however sweet. <br>
Foresight and wisdom we must not despise; <br>
The strongest lightning strikes not from dark skies.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> O fair philosopher of the heart! O God, <br>
I can resist no more, for you compel me!<br>
Do not imagine that I do not hold <br>
You in respect because my heart grows bold. <br>
It throbs to bursting, all my nerves are tense. <br>
I can resist no more. Soon I'll be gone,<br>
Far, far away from here, from you divided. <br>
Then, worlds, plunge down, plunge down into the abyss! <br>
Forgive me, sweet my child, forgive the hour <br>
That drives me onward with such violent power. <br>
I love you, Beatrice, by God I swear it, <br>
And Love and Beatrice make but one word <br>
That I can utter only in one breath, <br>
And in this thought I'd go to meet my death.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Beatrice. </i>Since good can never come of it, I pray <br>
Speak no more thus. If--but this cannot be--<br>
You were to win my heart, now, straightaway, <br>
Surely you would no longer honour me. <br>
You'd say that I was just a common thing, <br>
Ready, as thousands are, to have her fling. <br>
If for a moment such a notion crossed <br>
Your mind, then love and honour would be lost. <br>
Twould mean that you cared for me not a jot,<br>
And self-reproach would have to be my lot.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> Tender and lovely being, hear me plead!<br>
If only in my bosom you could read,<br>
I never loved till now, by God above, <br>
And your reproaches make a mock of love.<br>
Let the base merchant haggle over flaws, <br>
By shrewd delays more profit still he draws. <br>
Love brings the union of the worlds about, <br>
Naught is beyond, and naught else to desire. <br>
Let those who bind themselves in hatred doubt.<br>
Love is a flashing spark from Life's own fire, <br>
Magic that holds us in an open ring, <br>
So yield to it--this is the only thing <br>
That counts in love, not prudent carefulness; <br>
For love is quick to kindle, quick to bless.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Beatrice. </i>Shall I be modest? Coy? No, I must dare, <br>
However high may leap the flames' fierce flare. <br>
Yet my breast tightens under fearful strain <br>
As if delight were mixed with searing pain, <br>
As if between our union there came floating <br>
A hissing sound mixed in by devils gloating.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> It is the fire which you do not yet know, <br>
And the old life, which now has turned to go <br>
Away from us, is speaking its last word;<br>
Then its reproaches will no more be heard.<br>
    But tell me, Beatrice, how will you be mine!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Beatrice.</i> My father wants to tie me to a man <br>
Whom I would hate if I could hate my fellows. <br>
But be assured you soon will hear from me.<br>
    Where are you staying, sweet friend of my heart?</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo. </i>Why, at Pertini's house.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Beatrice.</i> I'll send a courier.<br>
But now your name? Most surely it must sound <br>
As does the music of the circling spheres.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo (in a serious voice)</i>. Lucindo is my name.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Beatrice.</i> Lucindo! Sweet,<br>
Sweet rings that name to me. Ah, my Lucindo, <br>
He is my world, my God, my heart, my all.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> Beatrice, that's yourself, and you are more, <br>
You are yet more than all, for you are Beatrice.</p>
<p class="fst">
<p class="fst"><i>(He presses her ardently to his breast. The door bursts open and Wierin enters.)</i></p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Wierin. </i>A pretty sight! O Beatrice! O snake! <br>
Puppet of virtue, are you, cold as marble!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> What do you mean by this? What do you seek?<br>
By God, no ape could ever look so sleek.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Wierin. </i>Damned boy, you'll soon enough learn what I mean. <br>
We'll speak together, you and I, O rival<br>
Fashioned in human form to make it loathsome, <br>
Creature puffed up with impudent conceit, <br>
A piece of blotting-paper to wipe pens on, <br>
A comic hero of some wretched jape.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> And as remarked, behold the complete ape! <br>
Shame on you thus to bandy words with me! <br>
Such courage is like barrel-organ music <br>
Played to a painted picture of a battle.<br>
    Soon the real thing will count.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Wierin.</i> Soon? Now boy, now we'll have this matter out!<br>
B-b-by God--my very blood runs cold!<br>
Beatrice, I'll finish off this paramour.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> Silence, fellow, I'll follow you this instant.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>(Pertini enters.) </i></p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> What's all this noise? You think you're on the street?</p>
<p class="fst"><i>(To Wierin.)</i></p>
<p class="fst"> Why do you screech, you crow? I'll stop your mouth!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>(Aside.) </i></p>
<p class="fst">I've come just in the nick of time. The fellow <br>
Has somewhat misinterpreted my meaning.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>(Beatrice falls in a faint.)</i></p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo.</i> Help! She swoons! O God!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i> (He bends over her.)</i></p>
<p class="fst">Come to yourself, angel, sweet spirit, speak!</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>(He kisses her.)</i></p>
<p class="fst"> Feel you the warmth? Her eyelids flutter, she breathes! <br>
Beatrice, why are you so? Oh, tell me, why?<br>
 You want to kill me? Can I see you thus?</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>(He raises her up, embracing her. Wierin wants to rush upon him.<br>
Pertini holds him back.)</i></p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> Come, friend Crow, just a few words in your ear.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Beatrice (in a faint voice)</i>. Lucindo, my Lucindo, ah, my lost one,<br>
And lost to me, my heart, before I won you.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Lucindo. </i>Be calm, my angel, nothing shall be lost, <br>
And soon I'll see this fellow breathe his last.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>(He carries her to the sofa.)</i></p>
<p class="fst">Lie there a while; we cannot long remain, <br>This holy place must bear no evil stain.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Wierin. </i>Come, we shall speak together.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Pertini.</i> I'll come too.<br>
One second at a duel is something new.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i> Lucindo.</i> Compose yourself, sweet child, be of good cheer.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>Beatrice.</i> Farewell.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>Lucindo.</i> Angel, farewell.</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Beatrice (with a deep sigh)</i>. I'm full of fear.</p>

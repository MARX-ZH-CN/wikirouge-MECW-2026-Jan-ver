<h1>The Magic Harp</h1>
<h3>A Ballad</h3>
<p class="fst">
So strangely in the ear it sings,<br>
Like thrilling harp, like trembling strings,<br>
It wakes the Minstrel sleeping.<br>
"Why beats the heart so fearfully,<br>
What are those sounds, like harmony<br>
Of Stars and Spirits weeping?"</p>
<p class="fst">
He rises, springs from off his bed,<br>
Towards the shadows turns his head<br>
And sees the cords of gold.<br>
"Come, Minstrel, step you up and down,<br>
High in the air, deep in the ground,<br>
Those strings you cannot hold."</p>
<p class="fst">
He sees it growing, branching wide,<br>
His soul is troubled deep inside,<br>
The sound swells in the air.<br>
He follows, and it lures him on,<br>
By ghostly stairways up and down,<br>
Here, there and everywhere.</p>
<p class="fst">
He stops. A gate swings open wide,<br>
A burst of music from inside<br>
Would carry him away.<br>
A Lyre in golden splendour bright<br>
Sounds forth in song all day and night,<br>
But no one's there to play.</p>
<p class="fst">
It grips him like desire, like pain,<br>
His bosom swells, his heart within<br>
Beats high beyond control.<br>
"The Lyre plays from my own heart, <br>
It is myself, its pangs--the Art<br>
That gushes from my soul."</p>
<p class="fst">
In ecstasy he plucks the strings,<br>
The sound trills high as mountain springs,<br>
Dives booming, like the abyss.<br>
His blood leaps wild, far swells his song,<br>
Was never yearning's pain so strong,<br>
He saw the world no more.</p>

<h1>To My Father</h1>
<h3>I<br>
Creation</h3>
<p class="fst">
Creator Spirit uncreated<br>
     Sails on fleet waves far away,<br>
Worlds heave, Lives are generated,<br>
His Eye spans Eternity.<br>
All inspiriting reigns his Countenance,<br>
In its burning magic, Forms condense.</p>
<p class="fst">
Voids pulsate and Ages roll,<br>
Deep in prayer before his Face;<br>
Spheres resound and Sea-Floods swell,<br>
Golden Stars ride on apace.<br>
Fatherhead in blessing gives the sign,<br>
And the All is bathed in Light divine.
<p class="fst">
In bounds self-perceived, the Eternal<br>
Silent moves, reflectively,<br>
Until holy Thought primordial<br>
Dons Forms, Words of Poetry.<br>
Then, like Thunder-lyres from far away<br>
Like prescient Creation's Jubilee:</p>
<p class="fst">
"Gentler shine the floating stars,<br>
Worlds in primal Rock now rest;<br>
O my Spirit's images,<br>
           Be by Spirit new embraced;<br>
When to you the heaving bosoms move,<br>
Be revealed in piety and love.</p>
<p class="fst">
"Be unlocked only to Love;<br>
Eternity's eternal seat,<br>
As to you I gently gave,<br>
           Hurl you my Soul's lightning out.<br>
'Harmony alone its like may find,<br>
Only Soul another Soul may bind.'</p>
<p class="fst">
Out of me your Spirits burn<br>
Into Forms of lofty meaning;<br>
To the Maker you return,<br>
Images no more remaining,<br>
By Man's look of Love ringed burningly,<br>
You in him dissolved, and he in me."</p>
<a id="p535"></a>
<h3> II<br>
Poetry</h3>
<p class="fst">
Flames Creator-like once poured<br>
Streaming to me from your breast,<br>
Clashing up on high they soared,<br>
And I nursed them in my breast.<br>
Shone your form like Aeolus-strains above,<br>
Shielded soft the fire with wings of Love.</p>
<p class="fst">
I saw glow and I heard sound,<br>
Heavens onward sweeping far,<br>
Rising up and sinking down,<br>
Sinking but to soar the higher.<br>
Then, when inner strife at last was quelled,<br>
Grief and Joy made music I beheld.</p>
<p class="fst">
Nestling close to forms so soft<br>
      Stands the Soul, by spells enchained,<br>
From me images sailed aloft<br>
By your very Love inflamed.<br>
Limbs of Love, by Spirit once released,<br>
Shine again within their Maker's breast.</p>

<h3>The Viennese Ape Theatre in Berlin</h3>
<h3>I</h3>
<p class="fst">
"The public's shoving, unafraid of bruises!<br>
Some Talma there, perhaps, home of the Muses!"<br>
Please, friend, sharp weapons don't attract.<br>
It's comedy--by apes that act.</p>
<p class="fst">
At ease, I watched the apes put on<br>
Their show. And it was good clean fun.<br>
So natural--just one thing missing,<br>
Which was, to use the walls for p--.</p>
<p class="fst">
Suddenly, somebody plucked my cloak.<br>
"Really, that was a peculiar joke!<br>
A young girl swooned at what she saw,<br>
Flew on a monkey's breast and claws.<br>
She batted her eyes, said timidly:<br>
'O depths of exquisite agony!<br>
O harmony! Delicious sorrow!<br>
That monkey thrills me to the marrow!<br>
I feel as if I were magnetised,<br>
The ape played me; I loved him, hypnotised.<br>
O monkey, speak, for I'm bewitched by you!<br>
I just can't breathe, my head is spinning, too!"</p>
<a id="p540"></a>
<h3>Sir (G)luck's Armide</h3>
<h3>I</h3>
<p class="fst">
I also sought amusement, so<br>
I spared no money for a show,<br>
Threw on my frock-coat by lamplight,<br>
And entered the nearest box that night.<br>
I got much worse than I'd bargained for;<br>
Oh, how I cursed myself and swore.<br>
A missie needs must make me hold<br>
The libretto. I muttered, "My hand feels cold!"<br>
"Well, then, wear gloves!" the lady cried.<br>
"They get on my nerves, Miss!" I replied.<br>
She bared her neck and bosom and all,<br>
And asked me to keep an eye on her shawl.<br>
Said I to her, "The fire burns low,<br>
And raw flesh gives me vertigo!"<br>
She shrieked, "Oh, wasn't the ballet divine!"<br>
Said I, "O God, has the gazette got anything worth<br>
reading about in the meantime?"</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p class="fst">
 I sat, lost in the music's spell.<br>
She sneered, "The man's a fool as well!"</p>
<a id="p540a"></a>
<h3>Terms of Engagement</h3>
<p class="fst">
<i>Mistress:</i> Now then, just what d'you want of me?<br>
<i>Maid:</i>  The usual terms. But one more thing-<br>
To avoid any family quarrelling,<br>
I must have visitors once a month for tea.</p>
<a id="p540b"></a>
<h3>Sentimental Souls</h3>
<p class="fst">
The butcher's slaughtering a calf. They cry.<br>
The creature bellows till it's been bled dry.<br>
They laugh. O Heaven, how very, very weird<br>
The ways of Nature. A dog wears no beard.<br>
Why all these ravings, as if from sunstroke?<br>
We hear that even Balaam's Ass once spoke!</p>
<a id="p541"></a>
<h3>Romanticism À La Mode</h3>
<p class="fst">
The child who, as you know, once wrote to Goethe,<br>
Wanting to make him fancy that he loved her,<br>
Went to the theatre one fine day.<br>
     A Uniform then stalked her way<br>
And came towards her with a friendly smile.<br>
"Kind Sir, Bettina wishes, for a while,<br>
Smitten with sweet desire, to rest<br>
Her curly head upon your breast."<br>
The Uniform then answered rather drily,<br>
"Bettina, that is up to you entirely!"<br>
"Sweetie," she answered in a trice,<br>
"Of course you're sure I have no lice!"</p>
<a id="p541a"></a>
<h3> To the Sun of Truth (F. Quednow)</h3>
<p class="fst">
Lamplight and star glimmer,<br>
Depth of heart and beauty's shimmer,<br>
Soul's grace and white skin's bloom-<br>
You never show them openly,<br>
Sun of Truth you claim to be.<br>
     Every bride has her groom,<br>
Sun of Truth you well may call<br>
Yourself--the Sun throws shadows, after all!</p>
<a id="p541b"></a>
<h3>On a Certain Knight-Hero</h3>
<p class="fst">
Dig at him here, dig at him there, and ever<br>
You'll find that Knight and Hero merge together.<br>
His dance-talk's up-to-date all right,<br>
But ancient bugs eat him at night.</p>
<a id="p541c"></a>
<h3>To My Neighbour Across the Street</h3>
<p class="fst">
She stares at me from over yonder<br>
God, I can't stand it any longer.<br>
A little man, a yellow house,<br>
A woman lank and nauseous.<br>
Since Inspiration could take flight,<br>
I'd better pull the blind down--tight.</p>
<a id="p545"></a>
<h3>A Philistine Wonders</h3>
<p class="fst">
"I don't know how they quarrel with themselves the way  they do.<br>
<br>Just button up your coat, good sir, and they won't steal from you."</p>
<a id="p545a"></a>
<h3> Mathematical Wisdom</h3>
<h3>I</h3>
<p class="fst">
We have boiled everything down to signs,<br>
And Reasoning's done on strict mathematical lines.<br>
If God's a point, as cylinder he just won't pass,<br>
You can't stand on your head while sitting on your----.
<h3>II</h3>
<p class="fst">
If a's the Beloved and b is the Lover,<br>
My shirt I'll wager ten times over<br>
That a and b when added up'll<br>
Constitute one Loving Couple.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p class="fst">
 Measure the World with lines about,<br>
You'll never drive its Spirit out.<br>
If feuds were settled by a and b,<br>
The Courts would be swindled out of their fee.</p>
<a id="p547"></a>
<h3>
To the Medical Students</h3>
<p class="fst">
Damned philistino-medico-student crew,<br>
The whole world's just  bag of bones to you.<br>
When once you've cooled the blood with Hydrogen,<br>
And when you've felt the pulse's throbbing, then<br>
You think, "I've done the most I'm able to.<br>
Man could be very comfortable, too.<br>
How clever of Almighty God to be<br>
So very well versed in Anatomy!"<br>
And flowers are all instruments to use,<br>
When they've been boiled down into herbal brews.</p>
<a id="p547a"></a>
<h3>Medical Student Psychology</h3>
<p class="fst">
Who eats a supper of dumplings and noodles,<br>
Will suffer from--nightmares, oodles and oodles.</p>
<a id="p547b"></a>
<h3>Medical Student Metaphysics</h3>
<p class="fst">
No Spirit ever has existed.<br>
Oxen have lived and never missed it.<br>
The Soul is idle fantasy;<br>
In the stomach it certainly can't be found,<br>
And if one were able to run it to ground,<br>
Then almost any pill would set it free.<br>
Then Spirits would be seen<br>
Emerging in an endless stream.</p>
<a id="p547c"></a>
<h3>Medical Student Anthropology</h3>
<p class="fst">
He who would sickness foil<br>
Must learn to rub his nether half with oil,<br>
So that no wind or draught<br>
Can chill him fore and aft.<br>
Man also can achieve his ends<br>
With dietary regimens;<br>
   And Culture thus emerges<br>
As soon as Man starts using purges.</p>
<a id="p548"></a>
<h3>Medical Student Ethics</h3>
<p class="fst">
Lest perspiration harm, it's best<br>
On journeys to wear more than just one vest.<br>
Beware all passion that produces<br>
Disorders of the gastric juices.<br>
Do not let your glances wander<br>
Where flames can burst your eyes asunder.<br>
Mix water with your wine,<br>
Take milk in coffee every time;<br>
And don't forget to have us called<br>
When leaving for the Afterworld.</p>

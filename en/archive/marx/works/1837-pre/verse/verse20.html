<p class="title">Early Works of Karl Marx: Book of Verse</p>
<h1>Human Pride</h1>
<p class="fst">
When these stately Halls I scan<br>
    And the giant burden of these Houses,<br>
And the stormy pilgrimage of Man<br>
And the frenzied race that never ceases,</p>
<p class="fst">
Pulse's throbbing do I sense<br>
    And the giant flame of Soul so proud?<br>
Shall the Waves then bear you hence<br>
Into Life, into the Ocean's flood?</p>
<p class="fst">
Shall I then revere these forms<br>
    Heavenward soaring, proud, inviolate?<br>
Should I yield before the Life that storms<br>
Towards the Indeterminate?</p>
<p class="fst">
No! You pigmy-giants so wretched,<br>
And you ice-cold stone Monstrosity,<br>
See how in these eyes averted<br>
Burns the Soul's impetuosity.</p>
<p class="fst">
Swift eye scans the circles round,<br>
Hastens through them all exploringly,<br>
Yearning, as on fire, resounds,<br>
Mocking through the vast Halls and away.</p>
<p class="fst">
When you all go down and sink,<br>
Fragment-world shall lie around,<br>
Even though cold Splendour blink,<br>
    Even though grim Ruin stand its ground.</p>
<p class="fst">
There is drawn no boundary,<br>
    No hard, wretched earth-clod bars our way,<br>
And we sail across the sea,<br>
    And we wander countries far away.</p>
<p class="fst">
Nothing bids to stay our going,<br>
Nothing locks our hopes inside;<br>
Swift away go fancies fleeing,<br>
    And the bosom's joy and pain abide.</p>
<p class="fst">
All those monstrous shapes so vast<br>
Tower aloft in fearfulness,<br>
Feeling not love's fiery blast<br>
    That creates them out of nothingness.</p>
<p class="fst">
No giant column soars to Heaven<br>
In a single block, victorious;<br>
One stone on the other meanly woven<br>
Emulates the timid snail laborious.</p>
<p class="fst">
But the Soul embraces all,<br>
    Is a lofty giant flame that glows,<br>
Even in its very Fall<br>
    Dragging Suns in its destructive throes.</p>
<p class="fst">
And out of itself it swells<br>
    Up to Heaven's realms on high;<br>
Gods within its depths it lulls,<br>
    Thunderous lightning flashes in its eye.</p>
<p class="fst">
And it wavers not a whit<br>
    Where the very God-Thought fares,<br>
On its breast will cherish it;<br>
     Soul's own greatness is its lofty Prayer.</p>
<p class="fst">
Soul its greatness must devour,<br>
In its greatness must go down;<br>
Then volcanoes seethe and roar,<br>
    And lamenting Demons gather round.</p>
<p class="fst">
Soul, succumbing haughtily,<br>
     Raises up a throne to giant derision;<br>
Downfall turns to Victory,<br>
     Hero's prize is proud renunciation.</p>
<p class="fst">
But when two are bound together,<br>
When two souls together flow,<br>
Each one softly tells the other<br>
     No more need alone through space to go.</p>
<p class="fst">
Then all Worlds hear melodies<br>
     Like the Aeolian harp full sighing,<br>
In eternal Beauty's rays<br>
     Wish and Soul's desire together flowing.</p>
<p class="fst">
Jenny! Do I dare avow<br>
     That in love we have exchanged our Souls,<br>
That as one they throb and glow,<br>
     And that through their waves one current rolls?</p>
<p class="fst">
Then the gauntlet do I fling<br>
     Scornful in the World's wide open face.<br>
Down the giant She-Dwarf, whimpering,<br>
Plunges, cannot crush my happiness.</p>
<p class="fst">
Like unto a God I dare<br>
    Through that ruined realm in triumph roam.<br>
Every word is Deed and Fire,<br>
    And my bosom like the Maker's own.</p>

<p class="title">Early Works of Karl Marx: Book of Verse</p>
<h1>The First Elegy</h1>
<h4>Ovid's <i>Tristia </i><br>
Freely Rendered</h4>
<table align="center" width="50%"><tr><td>
<h5>1</h5>
<p class="fst">
Go, little book, make haste away,<br>
Go to the joyful victory seat.<br>
I go not with you, I must stay,<br>
    For by Jove's lightning I was hit.</p>
<h5>2</h5>
<p class="fst">
Go, poorly clad and indigent!<br>
    Put on your Master's mourning dress,<br>
As is befitting banishment,<br>
    And as commands this time of stress.</p>
<h5>3</h5>
<p class="fst">
On you must shine no purple veil<br>
To make in violet's blood its show.<br>
Longing and hope without avail<br>
Cannot wear joy's exalted glow.</p>
<h5>4</h5>
<p class="fst">
In shameful silence hide your name,<br>
And let no scent of cedar waft,<br>
Nor silver knob shine bright to shame<br>
The blackness of your crooked staff.</p>
<h5>5</h5>
<p class="fst">
To works by Fortune blessed is due<br>
Such decoration, rare and bright.<br>
Only my pain shall mate with you,<br>
Only my sorrow's darkest night.</p>
<h5>6</h5>
<p class="fst">
Shaggy and rough you may appear,<br>
     Like one whose hair unkempt hangs down,<br>
Not rendered wondrous soft and fair<br>
By smoothing block of pumice-stone.</p>
<h5>7</h5>
<p class="fst">
If darker is your pallid face,<br>
    It is because by me 'twas stained.<br>
Oh, how my tears have flown apace<br>
And hotly down on you have rained.</p>
<h5>8</h5>
<p class="fst">
Go, book, and greet those places, greet<br>
The hallowed spot so dear to me.<br>
Dreams take me there on pinions fleet<br>
Of magic word and fantasy.</p>
<h5>9</h5>
<p class="fst">
If someone, seeing you, at last<br>
    Should find his memory stirred, and pester<br>
With questions flying thick and fast<br>
     Of him who sent you there, your Master;</p>
<h5>10</h5>
<p class="fst">
I'm still alive--that you may say,<br>
And that I hope for rescue soon,<br>
And if my pulse still beats away,<br>
It is a mercy, not a boon.</p>
<h5>11</h5>
<p class="fst">
If someone asks you further questions,<br>
Mind each and every spoken word.<br>
Beware of thoughtless indiscretions,<br>
In word and tone be on your guard.</p>
<h5>12</h5>
<p class="fst">
Many will scold you and berate you,<br>
Reminding you I was to blame.<br>
As my accomplice they will rate you,<br>
You will cast down your eyes in shame.</p>
<h5>13</h5>
<p class="fst">
To insults and to condemnation<br>
    Listen, but keep your mouth closed tight.<br>
Fire will not quench a conflagration,<br>
Two wrongs will never make a right.</p>
<h5>14</h5>
<p class="fst">
Yet some there'll be, as you will find,<br>
Who speak to you with melting sighs.<br>
A flow of gentle tears will blind<br>
The light of longing in their eyes.</p>
<h5>15</h5>
<p class="fst">
Then tender words will flow and mild<br>
Forth from the bosom agitated.<br>
"Could Caesar but be reconciled,<br>
The punishment be mitigated...."</p>
<h5>16</h5>
<p class="fst">
Who says with kind solicitude,<br>
     "May God be merciful on high,"<br>
For him I pray with gratitude,<br>
     "May thunder ever pass him by!"</p>
<h5>17</h5>
<p class="fst">
Would his desire might be fulfilled:<br>
    Oh, let me die there in that seat<br>
Which the Gods in their keeping hold.<br>
    May Caesar's lightning lose its heat!</p>
<h5>18</h5>
<p class="fst">
When thus my greetings you've conveyed.<br>
     They may lay charges at my door<br>
That no sweet form has been displayed,<br>
And that my spirit fails to soar.</p>
<h5>19</h5>
<p class="fst">
But let the critic be aware<br>
     During what times the work was done,<br>
And if his judgment's sound and fair,<br>
You need not fear--the danger's gone.</p>
<h5>20</h5>
<p class="fst">
For poetry's magic fullness flows<br>
    Out of a breast stirred with elation,<br>
But oh, a pall of darkest woes<br>
    Covers the brow, kills inspiration.</p>
<h5>21</h5>
<p class="fst">
And then his lyrics all bewail<br>
    The singer's exile, harsh and dread,<br>
And storm, and sea, and winter flail<br>
Around his all-unheeding head!</p>
<h5>22</h5>
<p class="fst">
Fear must not clutch with icy grip<br>
If splendid song is to be heard,<br>
A lonely outcast here, I weep--<br>
     Look, yonder gleams the murder-sword!</p>
<h5>23</h5>
<p class="fst">
          Whatever I have so far done<br>
    Has won the fairer critic round,<br>
And he will pass my message on,<br>
     Bearing my grievous plight in mind.</p>
<h5>24</h5>
<p class="fst">
 Give me Maeonides, for one, (Homer)<br>
Plunge him in misery, like me,<br>
His magic powers will be gone,<br>
Danger is all his eyes will see.</p>
<h5>25</h5>
<p class="fst">
Go, book, go forth upon your way,<br>
Heed not the voice of evil fame.<br>
If scornful folk cast you away,<br>
     Do not be overwhelmed by shame.</p>
<h5>26</h5>
<p class="fst">
'Tis not that Fortune's gentle waves<br>
Bear me so lovingly along<br>
That praise or prize my spirit craves,<br>
That I seek recompense for song.</p>
<h5>27</h5>
<p class="fst">
When with desire I still was bedded,<br>
Then inspiration welled in me,<br>
To thirst for glory I was fettered,<br>
The world's race for celebrity.</p>
<h5>28</h5>
<p class="fst">
But if the Lyre sounds as before,<br>
And if the urge still burns as strong,<br>
Surely my heart need ask no more,<br>
Seeing my downfall came from song?</p>
<h5>29</h5>
<p class="fst">
 Go--it is not prohibited<br>
   That you should see Rome's pomp for me.<br>
If only I might go instead,<br>
   Watched by a God indulgently!</p>
<h5>30</h5>
<p class="fst">
Do not imagine that you'll wend<br>
   Your way unrecognised through Rome,<br>
That to the public you will bend<br>
Your steps unheeded and unknown.</p>
<h5>31</h5>
<p class="fst">
Though you lack title, witnesses,<br>
Your colour will betray your name.<br>
If you deny me nonetheless,<br>
   You'll show yourself up just the same.</p>
<h5>32</h5>
<p class="fst">
Slip quietly through the gates and watch<br>
My songs inflict on you no hurt.<br>
No more they sing love's praises which<br>
So much delight the drunken heart.</p>
<h5>33</h5>
<p class="fst">
Who turns you cruelly away<br>
   Because you were born of my labours,<br>
And sternly says you lead astray<br>
Innocence with voluptuous dangers--</p>
<h5>34</h5>
<p class="fst">
To him say, "Only read my name.<br>
   No longer do I teach sweet love.<br>
Alas, the Gods to council came<br>
   And passed stern judgment from above."</p>
<h5>35</h5>
<p class="fst">
Seek not to climb to that great hall<br>
Which proudly dares to Heaven aspire.<br>
Approach not Caesar's pack at all<br>
    There, where his column soars still higher.</p>
<h5>36</h5>
<p class="fst">
Those sanctified and sacred spots<br>
Your Lord and Master now disown.<br>
The lightning from the castle shoots,<br>
The Higher Judgment strikes me down!</p>
<h5>37</h5>
<p class="fst">
Though Gods great, merciful and mild<br>
Abide within those halls up there,<br>
When the Spring's image comes with wild<br>
And furious storms, we shrink with fear.</p>
<h5>38</h5>
<p class="fst">
Alas, the dove with frightened sound<br>
Will tremble, though but Zephyr stir,<br>
While she is kissing dry the wound<br>
Inflicted by the hawk on her.</p>
<h5>39</h5>
<p class="fst">
The frightened lamb that gets away<br>
From the wolf's fangs, will not again<br>
Ever feel safe, unless it lie<br>
   Huddled inside the low-walled pen.</p>
<h5>40</h5>
<p class="fst">
 If Phaethon were alive today,<br>
    To Aether's vaults he would not soar,<br>
Nor would he drive so recklessly<br>
The coveted chariot team of four.</p>
<h5>41</h5>
<p class="fst">
Jove's weapons I indeed do dread,<br>
And from his sea of flame I flee.<br>
When Heaven thunders overhead,<br>
I think he hurls his spear at me.</p>
<h5>42</h5>
<p class="fst">
No sailor of the Argive fleet<br>
Who fled the Capharean shore,<br>
Will ever turn his sails to meet<br>
Euboea's surging flood once more.</p>
<h5>43</h5>
<p class="fst">
My bark, tossed by the tempest's force,<br>
Dares not draw nearer to that ground;<br>
It veers off on a different course,<br>
For much more distant places bound.</p>
<h5>44</h5>
<p class="fst">
And so, my book, be wise and sane,<br>
Mind how you go and take good care.<br>
No need to seek the Higher Fame<br>
When common people lend an ear.</p>
<h5>45</h5>
<p class="fst">
Icarus dared to soar on high,<br>
Audaciously he spread his wings.<br>
His name was destined not to die,<br>
In the swift ocean wave it sings.</p>
<h5>46</h5>
<p class="fst">
Whether to pull hard on the oars,<br>
Or leave the sails gently to swell-<br>
Postpone it for another hour-<br>
Time and the place will quickly tell.</p>
<h5>47</h5>
<p class="fst">
And when his brow is clear at last,<br>
When kindness beams upon his face,<br>
When all his rage is of the past,<br>
Quiescent, gone without a trace;</p>
<h5>48</h5>
<p class="fst">
When you, that still in terror stand<br>
And dare not yet approach from fright,<br>
Are proffered friendly word and hand,<br>
Then go--to day now yields the night.</p>
<h5>49</h5>
<p class="fst">
 More softly tolls the hour of Fate,<br>
   Unlike your Master you rejoice<br>
The torments of your wound abate,<br>
And Mercy speaks with gentle voice.</p>
<h5>50</h5>
<p class="fst">
The hurt can only be made less<br>
By him who caused it in his rage.<br>
Achilles wounded Telephus;<br>
   The pain he caused he then assuaged.</p>
<h5>51</h5>
<p class="fst">
Be sure not to spread any poison<br>
When trying to set matters right.<br>
Hope, ever bright and airy vision,<br>
Terror can turn you into night!</p>
<h5>52</h5>
<p class="fst">
Take care lest from its quiet repose<br>
Wrath in a violent storm should rise,<br>
Piling upon me yet more woes<br>
   That you have caused by deeds unwise.</p>
<h5>53</h5>
<p class="fst">
But if within the Muses' shrine<br>
A happy welcome should await,<br>
Bright in that house then you may shine<br>
Where Literature and Glory mate.</p>
<h5>54</h5>
<p class="fst">
And there you may be sure to see<br>
Drawn up in line the brothers, those<br>
Whom I beget in ecstasy<br>
    After the day had reached its close.</p>
<h5>55</h5>
<p class="fst">
All bear with open pride their names,<br>
In consciousness of victory:<br>
Like hope upon their brews it flames,<br>
And like the joy of poetry.</p>
<h5>56</h5>
<p class="fst">
Three only form a group apart,<br>
On every side by darkness pressed.<br>
They swell, luxurious with "Love's Art",<br>
(<i>ars amandi</i>)<br>
 And gaiety bubbles in each breast.</p>
<h5>57</h5>
<p class="fst">
Flee them, or bravely dare to call<br>
    For counsel fraught with curse and doom;<br>
Remember Oedipus' dread fall,<br>
Telegonus' appalling crime!</p>
<h5>58</h5>
<p class="fst">
Songs lately granted their salvation<br>
From violent death by fire and flame,<br>
Tell you their tales of Transformation<br>
                (<i>Metamorphosis</i>)<br>
And of worlds under Spirit-reign.</p>
<h5>59</h5>
<p class="fst">
Now tell the story of the change<br>
That's overcome my Fate at last,<br>
How it's turned into something strange,<br>
And how the form has been recast.</p>
<h5>60</h5>
<p class="fst">
Once it was different, when I sucked<br>
Warmth from the red lips of Success.<br>
Where the Immortals sealed their pact,<br>
The tears now flow of deep distress.
<h5>61</h5>
<p class="fst">
That you would ask what more I need<br>
Is plainly written on your face.<br>
Meanwhile, the graceful Horae speed<br>
Onward their rushing waves apace.</p>
<h5>62</h5>
<p class="fst">
And if with you I were to send<br>
All that seethes in my bosom now,<br>
Oh, I would never reach the end;<br>
   The weight would make the bearer bow.</p>
<h5>63</h5>
<p class="fst">
 The road is long. No time to spare,<br>
O book. Remotest of all lands<br>
Here with the Scythians I must share;<br>
Estranged from all the rest it stands.</p>

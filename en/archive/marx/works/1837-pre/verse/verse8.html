<h1>The Madwoman</h1>
<h3>A Ballad</h3>
<p>
 There dances a woman by moonlight,<br>
She glimmers far into the night,<br>
Robe fluttering wild, eyes glittering clear,<br>
Like diamonds set in rock-face sheer.</p>
<p class="fst">
"Come hither, O blue sea,<br>
I'll kiss you tenderly.<br>
Wreathe me a willow crown,<br>
Weave me a blue-green gown!</p>
<p class="fst">
"I bring fine gold and rubies red<br>
Wherein there beats my own heart's blood.<br>
On warm breast 'twas by lover worn,<br>
Into the ocean he was drawn.</p>
<p class="fst">
"For you, my songs I'll sing,<br>
That wind and wave must spring,<br>
High in the dance I'll leap,<br>
And wind and wave must weep!"</p>
<p class="fst">
She grasps a willow with her hand<br>
And binds it with a blue-green band.<br>
She eyes it in the strangest way,<br>
And bids it lightly step away.</p>
<p class="fst">
"Now lend your wings to me<br>
To echo down the sea:<br>
Mother, have you not known<br>
How fair I've wreathed your son?"</p>
<p class="fst">
So nightly here and there went she,<br>
Decked every willow by the sea.<br>
Proudly she danced there up and down,<br>
Until her magic course was run.</p>

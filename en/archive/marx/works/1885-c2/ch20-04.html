<h3>Chapter 20: Simple Reproduction</h3>
<h4>Part 4</h4>
<a id="12"></a>
<h5>XII. The Reproduction of the Money Material</h5>
<p class="fst">
One factor has so far been entirely disregarded, namely the annual
reproduction of gold and silver. As mere material for articles of luxury,
gilding, etc., there is as little occasion for special mention of them as
there is of mentioning any other products. But they play an important
role as money material and hence as potential money. For the sake of
simplicity we here regard only gold as material for money.</p>
<p>
According to older data the entire annual production of gold
amounted to 800,000-900,000 lbs., equal roundly to 1,100 or 1,250
million marks. But according to Soetbeers it amounted to only
170,675 kilograms, valued at roundly 476 million marks, based on the
average for 1871 to 1875. Of this amount Australia supplied roundly
167, the United States 166, and Russia 93 million marks. The
remainder is distributed over various countries in amounts of less than
10 million marks each. During the same period, the annual production
of silver amounted to somewhat less than 2 million kilograms, valued at
354½ million marks. Of this amount, Mexico supplied roundly 108, the
United States 102, South America 67, Germany 26 million, etc.</p>
<p>
Among the countries with predominantly capitalist production only
the United States is a producer of gold and silver. The capitalist
countries of Europe obtain almost all their gold, and by far the greater
part of their silver, from Australia, the United States, Mexico, South
America, and Russia.</p>
<p>
But we take it that the gold mines are in a country with capitalist
production whose annual reproduction we are here analysing, and for
the following reasons:</p>
<p>
Capitalist production does not exist at all without foreign commerce.
But when one assumes normal annual reproduction on a given scale one
also assumes that foreign commerce only replaces home products by
articles of other use or bodily form, without affecting value-relations,
hence without affecting either the value-relations in which the two
categories “means of production” and “articles of consumption” mutually exchange, or the relations between constant capital, variable capital, and surplus-value, into which the value of the product of each of these
categories may be divided. The involvement of foreign commerce in
analysing the annually reproduced value of products can therefore only
confuse without contributing any new element of the problem, or of its
solution. For this reason it must be entirely discarded. And consequently
gold too is to be treated here as a direct element of annual reproduction
and not as a commodity element imported from abroad by means of
exchange.</p>
<p>
The production of gold, like that of metals generally, belongs in class
I, the category which embraces the production of means of production.
Supposing the annual production of gold is equal to 30 (for
convenience’s sake; actually the figure is much too high compared to the
other figures of our scheme). Let this value be divisible into 20<sub>c</sub> + 5<sub>v</sub> + 5<sub>s</sub>; 20<sub>c</sub> is to be exchanged for other elements of I<sub>c</sub> and this is to be studied later; but the 5<sub>v</sub> + 5<sub>s</sub> (I) are to be exchanged for elements of II<sub>c</sub>, i.e., articles of consumption.</p>
<p>
As for the 5<sub>v</sub>, every gold-producing establishment begins by buying
labour-power. This is done not with gold produced by this particular
enterprise, but with a portion of the money-supply in the land. The
labourers buy with this 5<sub>v</sub> articles of consumption from II, and that buys
with this money means of production from I. Let II buy gold from I to the
amount of 2 as commodity material, etc. (component part of its constant
capital), then 2<sub>v</sub> flow back to gold producers I in money which has
already belonged to the circulation. If II does not buy any more material
from I, then I buys from II by throwing its gold into circulation as money,
since gold can buy any commodity. The difference is only that I does not
act here as a seller, but only as a buyer. Gold miners I can always get rid
of their commodity; it is always in a directly exchangeable form.</p>
<p>
Let us assume that some producer of yarn has paid 5<sub>v</sub> to his
labourers, who create for him in return — aside from the surplus-value — a
yarn product equal to 5. For 5 the labourers buy from II<sub>c</sub>, and the latter
buys yarn from I for 5 in money, and thus 5 flows back in money to the
spinner of yarn. Now in the case assumed I g (as we shall designate the
producers of gold) advances to its labourers 5<sub>v</sub> in money which
previously belonged to the circulation. The labourers spend it for articles
of consumption, but only 2 of the 5 return from II to I g. However I g can
begin the process of reproduction anew, just as well as the producer of
yarn. For his labourers have supplied him with 5 in gold, 2 of which he
sold and 3 of which he still has, so that he has but to coin 
<a href="#n45" id="45a"><sup class="enote">[45]</sup></a> them, or
turn them into bank-notes to have his entire variable capital again
directly in his hands in money-form, without the further intervention of
II.</p>
<p>
Even this first process of annual reproduction has wrought a change
in the quantity of money actually or virtually belonging to the circulation.
We assumed that II<sub>c</sub> bought 2<sub>v</sub> (I g) as material, and that I g has again laid out 3 — as the money-form of its variable capital — within II. Hence 3 of the mass of money supplied by the new gold production remained
within II and did not return to I. According to our assumption II has
satisfied its requirements in gold material. The 3 remain in its hands as
a gold hoard. Since they cannot constitute any element of its constant
capital, and since II had previously enough money-capital for the purchase
of labour-power; since furthermore these additional 3 g, with the
exception of the depreciation element, have no function to perform
within II<sub>c</sub>, for a portion of which they were exchanged (they could only
serve to cover the depreciation element <i>pro tanto</i>, if II<sub>c</sub> (1) should be smaller than II<sub>c</sub> (2), which would be accidental); on the other hand, however, namely with the exception of the depreciation element, the
entire commodity-product II<sub>c</sub>, must be exchanged for means of
production I<sub>(v + s)</sub>  — this money must be transferred in its entirety from II<sub>c</sub> to II<sub>s</sub>, no matter whether it exists in necessities of life or articles of luxury, and vice versa corresponding commodity-value must be
transferred from II<sub>s</sub> to II<sub>c</sub>. Result: A portion of the surplus-value is stored up as a money-hoard.</p>
<p>
In the second year of reproduction, provided the same proportion of
annually produced gold continues to be used as material, 2 will again
flow back to I g, and 3 will be replaced in kind, i.e., will be released
again in II as a hoard, etc.</p>
<p>
With reference to the variable capital in general: The capitalist I g,
like every other capitalist, must continually advance this capital in
money for the purchase of labour-power. But so far as this v is
concerned, it is not he but his labourers who have to buy from II. It can
therefore never happen that he should act as a buyer, throwing gold into
II without the initiative of II. But to the extent that II buys material from
him, and must convert constant capital II c into gold material, a portion of
(I g)<sub>v</sub> flows back to him from II in the same way that it does to other
capitalists of I. And so far as this is not the case, he replaces his v in
gold directly from his product. But to the extent that the v advanced in
money does not flow back to him from II, a portion of the already
available means of circulation (received from I and not returned to I) is
converted in II into a hoard and for that reason a portion of its surplus-value
is not expended for articles of consumption. Since new gold-mines
are continually opened or old ones re-opened, a certain portion of the
money to be laid out by I g in v is always part of the money existing prior
to the new gold production; it is thrown by I g through its labourers into
II, and unless it returns from II to I g it forms there an element of hoard
formation.</p>
<p>
But as for (I g)<sub>s</sub>, I g can always act here as buyer. He throws his s in
the shape of gold into circulation and withdraws from it in return articles
of consumption II<sub>c</sub>. In II the gold is used in part as material, and thus
functions as a real element of the constant constituent portion c of the
productive capital. When this is not the case it becomes once more an
element of hoard formation as a part of II<sub>s</sub> persisting in the form of
money. We see, then, aside from I<sub>c</sub> which we reserve for a later analysis, 
<a href="#n46" id="46a"><sup class="enote">[46]</sup></a> 
that even simple reproduction, excluding accumulation
proper, namely reproduction on an extended scale, necessarily includes
the storing up, or hoarding, of money. And as this is annually repeated,
it explains the assumption from which we started in the analysis of
capitalist production, namely, that at the beginning of the reproduction a
supply of money corresponding to the exchange of commodities is in the
hands of capitalist classes I and II. Such an accumulation takes place
even after deducting the amount of gold being lost through the
depreciation of money in circulation.</p>
<p>
It goes without saying that the more advanced capitalist production,
the more money is accumulated in all hands, and therefore the smaller
the quantity annually added to this hoard by the production of new gold,
although the absolute quantity thus added may be considerable. We
revert once more in general terms to the objection  raised against Tooke;
how is it possible that every capitalist draws a surplus-value in money
out of the annual product, i.e., draws more money out of the circulation
than he throws into it, since in the long run the capitalist class itself
must be regarded as the source of all the money thrown into circulation?</p>
<p>
We reply by summarising the ideas developed previously (in Chapter XVII):</p>
<p class="fst">
1) The only assumption essential here, namely, that in general there
is money enough for the exchange of the various elements of the mass of
the annual reproduction, is not affected in any way by the fact that a
portion of the commodity-value consists of surplus-value. Supposing that
the entire production belonged to the labourers themselves and that their
surplus-labour were therefore only surplus-labour for themselves, not for
the capitalists, then the quantity of circulating commodity-values would
be the same and, other things being equal, would require the same
amount of money for their circulation. The question in either case is
therefore only: Where does the money come from to make possible the
exchange of this total of commodity-values? It is not at all: where does
the money come from to turn the surplus-value into money?
It is true, to revert to it once more, that every individual commodity
consists of c + v + s, and the circulation of the entire quantity of
commodities therefore requires on the one hand a definite sum of money
for the circulation of the capital c + v and on the other hand another
sum for the circulation of the revenue of the capitalists, the surplus-value
s. For the individual capitalist, as well as for the entire capitalist class;
the money in which they advance capital is different from the money in
which they spend their revenue. Where does the latter money come
from? Simply from the mass of money in the hands of the capitalist
class, hence by and large from the total mass of money in society, a portion
of which circulates the revenue of the capitalists. We have seen
above that every capitalist establishing a new business recoups the
money which he spent for his maintenance in articles of consumption as
money serving to convert his surplus-value into money, once his
business is fairly under way. But generally speaking the whole difficulty
has two sources:</p>
<p>
In the first place, if we analyse only the circulation and the turnover
of capital, thus regarding the capitalist merely as a personification of
capital, not as a capitalist consumer and man about town, we see
indeed that he is continually throwing surplus-value into circulation as a
component part of his commodity-capital, but we never see money as a
form of revenue in his hands. We never see him throwing money into
circulation for the consumption of his surplus-value.</p>
<p>
In the second place, if the capitalist class throws a certain amount of
money into circulation in the shape of revenue, it looks as if it were
paying an equivalent for this portion of the total annual product, and this
portion thereby ceases to represent surplus-value. But the surplus-product
in which the surplus-value is represented does not cost the
capitalist class anything. As a class, the capitalists possess and enjoy it
gratuitously, and the circulation of money cannot alter this fact. The
alteration brought about by this circulation consists merely in the fact
that every capitalist, instead of consuming his surplus-product in kind, a
thing which is generally impossible, draws commodities of all sorts up to
the amount of the surplus-value he has appropriated out of the general
stock of the annual surplus-product of society and appropriates them. But 
the mechanism of the circulation has shown that while the capitalist
class throws money into circulation for the purpose of spending its
revenue, it also withdraws this money from the circulation, and can
continue the same process over and over again; so that, considered as a
class, capitalists remain as before in possession of the amount of money
necessary for the conversion of surplus-value into money. Hence, if the
capitalist not only withdraws his surplus-value from the commodity-market
in the form of commodities for his consumption-fund, but at the
same time gets back the money with which he has paid for these
commodities, he has evidently withdrawn the commodities from
circulation without paying an equivalent for them. They do not cost him
anything, although he pays money for them. If I buy commodities for one
pound sterling and the seller of the commodities gives me the pound
back for surplus-product which I got for nothing, it is obvious that I
received the commodities gratis. The constant repetition of this operation
does not alter the fact that I constantly withdraw commodities and
constantly remain in possession of the pound, although I part with it
temporarily to purchase commodities. The capitalist constantly gets this
money back as a money equivalent of surplus-value that has not cost
him anything.</p>
<p>
We have seen that with Adam Smith the entire value of the social
product resolves itself into revenue, into v + s, so that the constant
capital-value is set down as zero. It follows necessarily that the money
required for the circulation of the yearly revenue must also suffice for the
circulation of the entire annual product, that therefore in our illustration
the money required for the circulation of the articles of consumption
worth 3,000 also suffices for the circulation of the entire annual product
worth 9,000. This is indeed the opinion of Adam Smith, and it is
repeated by Th. Tooke. This erroneous conception of the ratio of the
quantity of money required for the realisation of revenue to the quantity
of money required to circulate the entire social product is the necessary
result of the uncomprehended, thoughtlessly conceived manner in which
the various elements of material and value of the total annual product
are reproduced and annually replaced. It has therefore already been
refuted.</p>
<p>
Let us listen to Smith and Tooke themselves.</p>
<p>
Smith says in Book II, Ch. 2:</p>
<p class="indentb">“The circulation of every country may
be considered as divided into two different branches: the circulation of
the dealers with one another, and the circulation between the dealers
and the consumers. Though the same pieces of money, whether paper
or metal, may be employed sometimes in the one circulation and
sometimes in the other; yet as both are constantly going on at the same
time, each requires a certain stock of money of one kind or another, to
carry it on. The value of the goods circulated between the different
dealers, never can exceed the value of those circulated between the
dealers and the consumers; whatever is bought by the dealers, being
ultimately destined to be sold to the consumers. The circulation between
the dealers, as it is carried on by wholesale, requires generally a pretty
large sum for every particular transaction. That between the dealers and
the consumers, on the contrary, as it is generally carried on by retail,
frequently requires but very small ones, a shilling, or even a halfpenny,
being often sufficient. But small sums circulate much faster than large
ones... Though the annual purchases of all the consumers, therefore,
are at least” [this “at least” is rich] “equal in value to those of all the dealers, they can generally be transacted with a much smaller quantity
of money;” etc.</p>
<p>
Th. Tooke remarks to this passage from Adam Smith (in <i>An Inquiry
into the Currency Principle</i>, London, 1844, pp. 34 to 36 <i>passim</i>):</p>
<p class="indentb">“There can be no doubt that the distinction here made is substantially correct ... the interchange between dealers and consumers including the
payment of wages, which constitute the <strong>principal means</strong> of the
consumers... All the transactions between dealers and dealers, by
which are to be understood all sales from the producer or importer,
through all the stages of intermediate processes of manufacture or
otherwise to the retail dealer or the exporting merchant, are resolvable
into movements or transfers of capital. Now transfers of capital do not
necessarily suppose, nor do actually as a matter of fact entail, in the
great majority of transactions, a passing of money, that is, bank-notes or
coin — I mean bodily, and not by fiction — at the time of transfer... The total amount of the transactions between dealers and dealers must, in the last
resort, be determined and limited by the amount of those between
dealers and consumers.”</p>
<p>
If this last sentence stood by itself, one might think Tooke simply
stated the fact that there was a ratio between the exchanges among
dealers and those among dealers and consumers, in other words,
between the value of the total annual revenue and the value of the
capital with which it is produced. But this is not the case. He explicitly
endorses the view of Adam Smith. A special criticism of his theory of
circulation is therefore superfluous.</p>
<p class="fst">
2) Every industrial capital, on beginning its career, throws at one fling
money into circulation for its entire fixed constituent part, which it
recovers but gradually, in the course of years, by the sale of its annual
products. Thus it throws at first more money into circulation than it
draws from it. This is repeated at every renewal of the entire capital in
kind. It is repeated every year for a certain number of enterprises whose
fixed capital is to be renewed in kind. It is repeated piecemeal at every
repair, every only partial renewal of the fixed capital. While, then, on the
one hand more money is withdrawn from circulation than is thrown into
it, the opposite takes place on the other hand.</p>
<p>

In all lines of industry whose production period — as distinguished
from its working period — extends over a long term, money is continually
thrown into circulation during this period by the capitalist producers,
partly in payment for labour-power employed, partly in the purchase of
means of production to be consumed. Means of production are thus
directly withdrawn from the commodity-market, and articles of
consumption, partly indirectly, by the labourers spending their wages,
and partly directly, by the capitalists, who do not by any means suspend
their consumption, although they do not simultaneously throw any
equivalent in commodities on the market. During this period the money
thrown by them into circulation serves to convert commodity value,
including the surplus-value embodied in it, into money. This factor
becomes very important in an advanced stage of capitalist production in
the case of long-drawn out enterprises, such as are undertaken by stock
companies, etc., for instance the construction of railways, canals, docks,
large municipal buildings, iron shipbuilding, large-scale drainage of land,
etc.</p>
<p class="fst">
3) While the other capitalists, aside from the investment in fixed
capital, draw more money out of the circulation than they threw into it
on purchasing the labour-power and the circulating elements, the gold- and
silver-producing capitalists throw only money into the circulation,
aside from the precious metal which serves as raw material, while they
withdraw only commodities from it. The constant capital, with the
exception of the depreciated portion, the greater portion of the variable
capital and the entire surplus-value, save the hoard which may be accumulating
in their own hands, are all thrown into circulation as money.</p>
<p class="fst">
4) On the one hand all kinds of things circulate as commodities
which were not produced during the given year, such as land lots,
houses, etc.; furthermore goods whose period of production exceeds one
year, such as cattle, timber, wine, etc. For this and other phenomena it
is important to establish that aside from the quantity of money required
for the immediate circulation there is always a certain quantity in a
latent non-functioning state which may start functioning if the impulse is
given. Furthermore, the value of such products circulates often
piecemeal and gradually, like the value of houses in the rents over a
number of years.</p>
<p>
On the other hand not all movements of the process of reproduction
are effected through the circulation of money. The entire process of
production, once its elements have been procured, is excluded from
circulation. All products which the producer himself consumes directly,
whether individually or productively, are also excluded. Under this head
comes also the feeding of agricultural labourers in kind.</p>
<p>
Therefore the quantity of money which circulates the annual product,
exists in society, having been gradually accumulated. It does not belong
to the value produced during the given year, except perhaps the gold
used to make good the loss of depreciated coins.</p>
<p>
This exposition presupposes the exclusive circulation of precious
metals as money, and in this circulation the simplest form of cash
purchases and sales; although money can function also as a means of
payment, and has actually done so in the course of history, even on the
basis of circulating plain metal coin, and though a credit system and
certain aspects of its mechanism have developed upon that basis.
This assumption is not made from mere considerations of method,
although these are important enough, as demonstrated by the fact that
Tooke and his school, as well as their opponents, were continually
compelled in their controversies concerning the circulation of bank-notes
to revert to the hypothesis of a purely metallic circulation. They were
forced to do so <i>post festum</i> and did so very superficially, which was
unavoidable, because the point of departure in their analysis thus played
merely the role of an incidental point.</p>
<p>
But the simplest study of money — circulation presented in its
<i>primitive</i> form — and this is here an immanent element of the process of annual reproduction — demonstrates:</p>
<p class="fst">

a) Advanced capitalist production, and hence the domination of the
wage system, being assumed, money-capital obviously plays a
prominent role, since it is the form in which the variable capital is
advanced. In step with the development of the wage system, all
products are transformed into commodities and must therefore — with a
few important exceptions — pass in their entirety through the
transformation into money as one phase of their movement. The quantity
of circulating money must suffice for this conversion of commodities into
money, and the greater part of this mass is furnished in the form of
wages, of the money advanced by the industrial capitalists as the
money-form of the variable capital in payment for labour-power, and
which functions in the hands of the labourers, generally speaking, only
as a medium of circulation (means of purchase). It is quite the opposite
of natural economy such as is predominant under every form of bondage
(including serfdom), and still more so in more or less primitive
communities, whether or not they are attended by conditions of bondage
or slavery.</p>
<p>
In the slave system, the money-capital invested in the purchase of
labour-power plays the role of the money-form of the fixed capital, which
is but gradually replaced as the active period of the slave’s life expires.
Among the Athenians therefore, the gain realised by a slave owner
directly through the industrial employment of his slave, or indirectly by
hiring him out to other industrial employers (e.g., for mining), was
regarded merely as interest (plus depreciation allowance) on the
advanced money-capital, just as the industrial capitalist under capitalist
production places a portion of the surplus-value plus the depreciation of
his fixed capital to the account of interest and replacement of his fixed
capital. This is also the rule with capitalists offering fixed capital
(houses, machinery, etc.) for rent. Mere household slaves, whether they
perform necessary services or are kept as luxuries for show, are not
considered here. They correspond to the modern servant class. But the
slave system too — so long as it is the dominant form of productive
labour in agriculture, manufacture, navigation, etc., as it was in the
advanced states of Greece and Rome — preserves an element of natural
economy. The slave market maintains its supply of the commodity
labour-power by war, piracy, etc., and this rapine is not promoted by a
process of circulation, but by the actual appropriation of the labour-power
of others by direct physical compulsion. Even in the United
States, after the conversion of the buffer territory between the wage-labour
states of the North and the slavery states of the South into a
slave-breeding region for the South, where the slave thrown on the
market thus became himself an element of the annual reproduction, this
did not suffice for a long time, so that the African slave trade was
continued as long as possible to satisfy the market.</p>
<p class="fst">
b) The fluxes and refluxes of money taking place spontaneously on
the basis of capitalist production in the exchange of the annual products;
the one-time advances of fixed capitals to the full extent of their value
and the successive extraction of this value from the circulation in the
course of years, in other words, their gradual reconstitution in money-form
by the annual formation of hoards, a hoarding which is essentially
different from the parallel accumulation of hoards based on the annual
production of new gold; the different lengths of time for which,
depending on the duration of the production period of the commodities,
money must be advanced, and consequently always hoarded anew
before it can be recovered from the circulation by the sale of the
commodities; the different lengths of time for which money must be advanced,
if only resulting from the different distances of the places of
production from their markets; furthermore the differences in the
magnitude and period of the reflux according to the condition or relative
size of the productive supplies in the various lines of business and in the
individual businesses of the same line, and hence the lengths of periods
for which the elements of constant capital are bought, and all this during
the year of reproduction — all these different aspects of spontaneous
movement had only to be noted, and made conspicuous, through
experience, in order to give rise to a methodical use of the mechanical
appliances of the credit system and to a real fishing out of available
loanable capitals.</p>
<p>

To this must be added the difference between those lines of business
whose production proceeds under otherwise normal conditions
continuously on the same scale, and those which apply varying
quantities of labour-power in different periods of the year, such as
agriculture.</p>
<a id="13"></a>
<h5>XIII. Destutt De Tracy’s Theory of Reproduction</h5>
<p class="fst">
Let us illustrate the confused and at the same time boastful
thoughtlessness of political economists analysing social reproduction,
with the example of the great logician Destutt de Tracy (Vol. 1, Ch. V,
Note), whom even Ricardo took seriously and called a <strong>very distinguished
writer</strong>. (<i>Principles</i>, p. 333.)</p>
<p>
This “distinguished writer” gives the following explanations
concerning the entire process of social reproduction and circulation:</p>
<p class="indentb">“I shall be asked how these industrial entrepreneurs can make such large profits and out of whom they can draw them. I reply that they do
so by selling everything which they produce for more than it has cost to
produce; and that they sell:</p>
<p class="indentb">“1) to one another for the entire portion of their consumption
intended for the satisfaction of their needs, which they pay with a
portion of their profits;</p>
<p class="indentb">“2) to the wage-labourers, both those whom they pay and those
whom the idle capitalists pay; from these wage-labourers they thus
extract their entire wages except perhaps their small savings;</p>
<p class="indentb">“3) to the idle capitalists who pay them with the portion of their
revenue which they have not yet given to the wage-labourers employed
by them directly; so that the entire rent which they pay them annually
flows back to them in this way or the other.” (Destutt de Tracy, <i>Traité de la volonté et de ses effets,</i> Paris, 1826, p. 239.)</p>
<p class="fst">
In other words, the capitalists enrich themselves by mutually getting
the best of one another in the exchange of that portion of their surplus-value
which they set apart for their individual consumption or consume
as revenue. For instance, if this portion of their surplus-value or of their
profits is equal to £400, this sum of £400 is supposed to grow to, say,
£500 by each stockholder of the £400 selling his share to another 25
per cent in excess. But since all do the same, the result will be the same
as if they had sold to one another at the real values. They merely need
£500 in money for the circulation of commodities worth £400, and this
would seem to be rather a method of impoverishing than of enriching
themselves since it compels them to keep a large portion of their total
wealth unproductively in the useless form of circulation media. The
whole thing boils down to this, that despite the all-round nominal rise in
the price of their commodities the capitalist class has only £400 worth
of commodities to divide among themselves for their individual
consumption, but that they do one another the favour of circulating
£400 worth of commodities by means of a quantity of money which is
required to circulate £500 worth of commodities.</p>
<p>
And this quite aside from the fact that a “portion of their profits,” and
therefore in general a supply of commodities in which there exist profits,
is here assumed. But Destutt undertook precisely to tell us where those
profits come from. The quantity of money required to circulate the profit
is a very subordinate question. The quantity of commodities in which the
profit is represented seems to have its origin in the circumstance that the
capitalists not only sell these commodities to one another, although even
this much is quite fine and profound, but sell them to one another at
prices which are too high. So we now know one source of the
enrichment of the capitalists. It is on a par with the secret of the
“Entspektor Bräsig"”
<a href="#n47" id="47a"><sup class="enote">[47]</sup></a> that the great poverty is due to the great “<i>pauvreté</i>.”</p>
<p class="fst">
2) The same capitalists furthermore sell</p>
<p class="indentb">“to the wage-labourers, both
those whom they pay and those whom the idle capitalists pay; from
these wage-labourers they thus recover their entire wages, except
perhaps their small savings.”</p>
<p class="fst">
According to Monsieur Destutt, then, the reflux of the money-capital,
the form in which the capitalists have advanced wages to the labourers,
is the second source of the enrichment of these capitalists.
If therefore the capitalists paid for instance £100 to their labourers as
wages and if these same labourers then buy from the same capitalists
commodities of this same value, of £100, so that the sum of £100
which the capitalists had advanced as buyers of labour-power returns to
the capitalists when they sell to the labourers £100 worth of
commodities, the capitalists <i>get richer</i> thereby. It would appear to
anyone endowed with ordinary common sense that they only find
themselves once more in possession of their £100, which they owned
before this procedure. At the beginning of the procedure they have £100
in money. For these £100 they buy labour-power. The labour bought
produces for these £100 in money commodities of a value which, so far
as we now know, amounts to £100. By selling the £100 worth of
commodities to their labourers the capitalists recover £100 in money.
The capitalists then have once more £100 in money, and the labourers
have £100 worth of commodities which they have themselves produced.
It is hard to understand how that can make the capitalists any richer. If
the £100 in money did not flow back to them they would first have to
pay to the labourers £100 in money for their labour and secondly to give
them the product of this labour, £100 worth of articles of consumption,
for nothing. The reflux of this money might therefore at best explain why
the capitalists do not get poorer by this transaction, but by no means
why they get richer by it.</p>
<p>
To be sure it is another question how the capitalists came into
possession of the £100 and why the labourers, instead of producing
commodities for their own account, are compelled to exchange their
labour-power for these £100. But this, for a thinker of Destutt’s calibre,
is self-explanatory.</p>
<p>
Destutt himself is not quite satisfied with the solution. After all, he
did not tell us that one gets richer by spending a sum of money, a
hundred pounds, and then taking in again a sum of money amounting to
£100; hence, by the reflux of £100 in money, which merely shows why
the £100 in money do not get lost. He tells us that the capitalists get
richer</p>
<p class="indentb">“by selling everything which they produce for more than it has
cost to produce.”</p>
<p>
Consequently the capitalists must get richer also in their transactions
with the labourers by selling to them too dear. Very well!</p>
<p class="indentb">“They pay wages ... and all this flows back to them through the expenditures of all these people who pay them more” [for the products] “than they cost them [the capitalists] in wages.” (Ibid., p. 240.)</p>
<p>
In other words, the capitalists pay £100 in wages to the labourers, and then they sell to these labourers their own product at £120, so that they not only recover
their £100 but also gain £20? That is impossible. The labourers can pay
only with the money which they have received in the form of wages. If
they get £100 in wages from the capitalists they can buy only £100
worth, not £120 worth. So this will not work. But there is still another
way. The labourers buy from the capitalists commodities for £100, but
actually receive commodities worth only £80. Then they are absolutely
cheated out of £20. And the capitalist has absolutely gained £20,
because he actually paid for the labour-power 20 per cent less than its
value, or cut nominal wages 20 per cent by a circuitous route.</p>
<p>
The capitalist class would accomplish the same end if it paid the
labourers at the start only £80 in wages and afterwards gave them for
these £80 in money actually £80 worth of commodities. This seems to
be the normal way, considering the class of capitalists as a whole, for
according to Monsieur Destutt himself the labouring class must receive a
“sufficient wage” (p. 219), since their wages must at least be adequate
to maintain their existence and capacity to work,“"to procure the barest
subsistence.” (p. 180). If the labourers do not receive such sufficient
wages, that means, according to the same Destutt, “the death of
industry” (p. 208), which does not seem therefore to be a way in which
the capitalists can get richer. But whatever may be the scale of wages
paid by the capitalists to the working-class, they have a definite value,
e.g., £80. If the capitalist class pays the labourers £80, then it has to
supply them with commodities worth £80 for these £80 and the reflux
of the £80 does not enrich it. If it pays them £100 in money, and sells
them £80 worth of commodities for £100 it pays them in money 25 per
cent more than their normal wage and supplies them in return with 25
per cent less in commodities.</p>
<p>
In other words, the fund from which the capitalist class in general
derives its profits is supposedly made up of deductions from the normal
wages by paying less than its value for labour-power, i.e., less than the
value of the means of subsistence required for their normal reproduction
as wage-labourers. If therefore normal wages were paid, which is
supposed to be the case according to Destutt, there could be no profit
fund for either the industrial or the idle capitalists.</p>
<p>
Hence Destutt should have reduced the entire secret of how the
capitalist class gets richer to the following: by a deduction from wages.
In that case the other surplus-value funds, which he mentions under 1)
and 3), would not exist.</p>
<p>
Hence in all countries, in which the money wages of the labourers
should be reduced to the value of the articles of consumption necessary
for their subsistence as a class, there would be no consumption-fund
and no accumulation-fund for the capitalists, and hence also no
existence-fund for the capitalist class, and hence also no capitalist class.
And, according to Destutt, this should be the case in all wealthy and
developed countries with an old civilisation, for in them,</p>
<p class="indentb">“in our ancient societies, the fund for the maintenance of wage-labourers is ... an almost constant magnitude.” (Ibid., p. 202.)</p>
<p class="fst">
Even with a deduction from the wages, the capitalist does not enrich
himself by first paying the labourer £100 in money and then supplying
him with £80 worth of commodities for these £100, thus actually
circulating £80 worth of commodities by means of £100, an excess of
25 per cent. The capitalist gets richer by appropriating, besides the
surplus-value — that portion of the product in which surplus-value is
represented — 25 per cent of that portion of the product which the
labourer should receive in the form of wages. The capitalist class would
not gain anything by the silly method Destutt conceived. It pays £100 in
wages and gives back to the labourer for these £100 £80 worth of his
own product. But in the next transaction it must again advance £100 for
the same procedure. It would thus be indulging in the useless sport of
advancing £100 in money and giving in exchange £80 in commodities,
instead of advancing £80 in money and supplying in exchange for it £80
in commodities. That is to say, it would be continually advancing to no
purpose a money-capital which is 25 per cent in excess of that required
for the circulation of its variable capital, which is a very peculiar method
of getting rich.</p>
<p class="fst">
3) Finally the capitalist class sells</p>
<p class="indentb">“to the idle capitalists, who pay
them with the portion of their revenue which they have not yet given to
the wage-labourers employed by them directly; so that the entire rent,
which they pay them (the idle ones) annually, flows back to them in this
way or the other.”</p>
<p>
We have seen above that the industrial capitalists</p>
<p class="indentb">“pay with a portion of their profits the entire portion of their consumption intended for the satisfaction of their needs.”</p>
<p>
Take it, then, that their profits are equal to £200. And let them use up, say, £100 of this in their individual consumption. But the other half, or £100, does not belong to them; it belongs to the idle capitalists, i.e., to those who receive the ground-rent, and to capitalists who lend money on interest. So they have to pay £100 to these gentry. Let us assume that these gentry need £80 of this money
for their individual consumption, and £20 for the hire of servants, etc.
With those £80 they buy articles of consumption from the industrial
capitalists. Thus while these capitalists part with commodities to the
value of £80, they receive back £80 in money, or four-fifths of the £100 paid by them to the idle capitalists under the name of rent, interest, etc.</p>
<p>

Furthermore the servant class, the direct wage-labourers of the idle
capitalists, have received £20 from their masters. These servants
likewise buy articles of consumption from the industrial capitalists to the
amount of £20. In this way, while parting with commodities worth £20,
these capitalists have £20 in money flow back to them, the last fifth of
the £100 which they paid to the idle capitalists for rent, interest, etc.
At the close of the transaction the industrial capitalists have
recovered in money the £100 which they remitted to the idle capitalists
in payment of rent, interest, etc. But one half of their surplus-product,
equal to £100, passed meanwhile from their hands into the
consumption-fund of the idle capitalists.</p>
<p>
It is evidently quite superfluous for the question now under discussion
to bring in somehow or other the division of the £100 between the idle
capitalists and their direct wage-labourers. The matter is simple: their
rent, interest, in short, their share in the surplus-value equal to £200, is
paid to them by the industrial capitalists in money to the amount of
£100. With these £100 they buy directly or indirectly articles of
consumption from the industrial capitalists. Thus they pay back to them
the £100 in money and take from them articles of consumption worth
£100.</p>
<p>
This completes the reflux of the £100 paid by the industrial
capitalists in money to the idle capitalists. Is this reflux of money a
means of enriching the industrial capitalists, as Destutt imagines? Before
the transaction they had a sum of values amounting to £200, 100 being
money and 100 articles of consumption. After the transaction they have
only one half of the original sum of values. They have once more the
£100 in money, but they have lost the £100 in articles of consumption
which have passed into the hands of the idle capitalists. Hence they are
poorer by £100 instead of richer by £100. If instead of taking the
circuitous route of first paying out £100 in money and then receiving
this £100 in money back in payment of articles of consumption worth
£100, they had paid rent, interest, etc., directly in the bodily form of
their products, there would be no £100 in money flowing back to them
from the circulation, because they would not have thrown that amount
of money into the circulation. <i>Via</i> payment in kind the matter would
simply have taken this course: they would keep one half of the surplus-product
worth £200 for themselves and give the other half to the idle
capitalists without any equivalent in return. Even Destutt would not have
been tempted to declare this a means of getting richer. Of course the
land and capital borrowed by the industrial capitalists from the idle
capitalists and for which they have to pay a portion of their surplus-value
in the form of ground-rent, interest, etc., are profitable for them, for this
constitutes one of the conditions of production of commodities in general
and of that portion of the product which constitutes surplus-product or in
which surplus-value is represented. This profit accrues from the use of
the borrowed land and capital, not from the price paid for them. This
price rather constitutes a deduction from it. Otherwise one would have to
contend that the industrial capitalists would not get richer but poorer, if
they were able to keep the other half of their surplus-value for
themselves instead of having to give it away. This is the confusion which
results from mixing up such phenomena of circulation as a reflux of
money with the distribution of the product, which is merely promoted by
these phenomena of circulation.</p>
<p>
And yet the same Destutt is shrewd enough to remark:</p>
<p class="indentb">“Whence come the revenues of these idle gentry? Do the revenues not come out of the rent paid to them out of their profits by those who put the capitals of the former to work, i.e., by those who pay with the funds of the former a
labour which produces more than it costs, in a word, the industrial
capitalists? It is always necessary to hark back to them to find the
source of all wealth. It is they who in reality feed the wage-labourers
employed by the former.” (p. 246.)</p>
<p>
So now the payment of this rent, etc., is a deduction from the profit
of the industrial capitalists. Before it was a means wherewith they could
enrich themselves.</p>
<p>
But at least one consolation is left to our Destutt. These good
industrialists handle the idle capitalists the same way they have been
handling one another and the labourers. They sell them all commodities
too dear, for instance, by 20 per cent. Now there are two possibilities.
The idle capitalists either have other money resources aside from the
£100 which they receive annually from the industrial capitalists, or they
have not. In the first case the industrial capitalists sell them
commodities worth £100 at a price of, say, £120. Consequently on
selling their commodities they recover not only the £100 paid to the
idlers but £20 besides, which constitute really new value for them. How
does the account look now? They have given away £100 in commodities
for nothing, because the £100 in money that they were paid in part for
their commodities were their own money. Thus their own commodities
have been paid with their own money. Hence they have lost £100. But
they have also received an excess of £20 in the price of their
commodities over and above their value, which makes £20 to the good.
Balance this against the loss of £100, and you still have a loss of £80.
Never a plus, always a minus. The cheating practised against the idle
capitalists has reduced the loss of the industrial capitalists, but for all
that it has not transformed a diminution of their wealth into a means of
enrichment. But this method cannot go on indefinitely, for the idle
capitalists cannot possibly pay year after year £120 in money if they
take in only £100 in money year after year.</p>
<p>
There remains the other approach: The industrial capitalists sell
commodities worth £80 in exchange for the £100 in money they paid to
the idle capitalists. In this case, the same as before, they still give away
£80 for nothing, in the form of rent, interest, etc. By this fraudulent
means the industrial capitalists have reduced their tribute to the idlers,
but it still exists nevertheless and the idlers are in a position — according
to the same theory proclaiming that prices depend on the good will of
the sellers — to demand in the future £120 instead of £100, as formerly, for rent, interest, etc., on their land and capital.</p>
<p>
This brilliant analysis is quite worthy of that deep thinker who copies
on the one hand from Adam Smith that</p>
<p class="indentb">“labour is the source of all
wealth” (p. 242)</p>
<p>that the industrial capitalists</p>
<p class="indentb">“employ their capital to
pay for labour that reproduces it with a profit” (p. 246)</p>
<p>and who concludes on the other hand that these industrial capitalists</p>
<p class="indentb">“feed all the other people, are the only ones who increase the public wealth, and create all our means of enjoyment” (p. 242)</p>
<p>that it is not the capitalists who are fed by the labourers, but the labourers who are fed by the capitalists, for the brilliant reason that the money with which the
labourers are paid does not remain in their hands, but continually
returns to the capitalists in payment of the commodities produced by the
labourers.</p>
<p class="indentb">“All they do is receive with one hand and return with the
other. Their consumption must therefore be regarded as engendered by
those who hire them.” (p. 235.)</p>
<p>
After this exhaustive analysis of social reproduction and consumption,
as being brought about by the circulation of money, Destutt continues:</p>
<p class="indentb">“This is what perfects this <i>perpetuum mobile</i> of wealth, a movement which, though badly understood” (<i>mal connu</i>, I should say so!), “has justly been named circulation. For it is indeed a circuit and always returns to its point of departure. This is the point where production is
consummated.” (pp. 239 and 240.)</p>
<p>
Destutt, that very distinguished writer, <i>membre de l’Institut de
France et de la Société Philosophique de Philadelphie,</i> and in fact to a certain extent a luminary among the vulgar economists, finally requests
his readers to admire the wonderful lucidity with which he has presented
the course of social process, the flood of light which he has poured over
the matter, and is even condescending enough to communicate to his
readers, where all this light comes from. This must be read in the
original:</p>
<p class="indentb">“It will be noted, I hope, how much this manner of viewing the consummation of our wealth is in accord with all we have been saying concerning its
production and distribution, and at the same time how much light it throws on
the entire course of society. Whence this accord and this lucidity? From the
fact that we have met truth face to face. This recalls the effect of those mirrors
in which things are reflected accurately and in their true proportions when
correctly focussed, but in which everything appears confused and disjointed
when one is too close or too far away from them.” (pp. 242 and 243.)</p>

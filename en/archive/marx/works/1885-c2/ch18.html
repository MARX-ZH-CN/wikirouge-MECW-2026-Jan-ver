<h4>Part III: The Reproduction and Circulation of the Aggregate Social Capital</h4>
<h3>Chapter 18: Introduction</h3>
<a id="1"></a>
<h3>I. The Subject Investigated</h3>
<p class="fst">The direct process of the production of capital is its labour and self-expansion process, the process whose result is the commodity-product and whose compelling motive is the production of surplus-value.</p>
<p>The process of reproduction of capital comprises this direct process
of production as well as the two phases of the circulation process proper,
i.e., the entire circuit which, as a periodic process — a process which
constantly repeats itself in definite periods — constitutes the turnover
of capital.</p>
<p>Whether we study the circuit in the form of M ... M' or that of
P ... P, the direct process of production P itself always forms but one
link in this circuit. In the one form it appears as a promoter of the process
of circulation; in the other the process of circulation appears as its
promoter. Its continuous renewal, the continuous re-appearance of capital
as productive capital, is in either case determined by its transformations
in the process of circulation. On the other hand the continuously renewed
process of production is the condition of the transformations which the
capital undergoes ever anew in the sphere of circulation, of its alternate
appearance as money-capital and commodity-capital.</p>
<p>Every individual capital forms, however, but an individualised
fraction, a fraction endowed with individual life, as it were, of the aggregate
social capital, just as every individual capitalist is but an individual
element of the capitalist class. The movement of the social capital consists
of the totality of the movements of its individualised fractional parts,
the turnovers of the individual capitals. Just as the metamorphosis of
the individual commodity is a link in the series of metamorphoses of the
commodity-world — the circulation of commodities — so the metamorphosis of the individual capital, its turnover, is a link in the circuit described
by social capital.</p>
<p>This total process comprises both the productive consumption (the
direct process of production) together with the conversions of form (materially
considered, exchanges) which bring it about, and the individual consumption
together with the conversions of form or exchanges by which it is brought
about. It includes on the one hand the conversion of variable capital into
labour-power, and therefore the incorporation of labour-power in the process
of capitalist production. Here the labourer acts as the seller of his commodity,
labour-power, and the capitalist as its buyer. But on the other hand the
sale of the commodities embraces also their purchase by the working-class
appears as buyer and the capitalists as sellers of commodities to the labourers.</p>
<p>The circulation of the commodity-capital includes the circulation
of surplus-value, hence also the purchases and sales by which the capitalist
effect their individual consumption, the consumption of surplus-value.</p>
<p>The circuit of the individual capitals in their aggregate as social
capital, hence considered in its totality, comprises not only the circulation
of capital but also the general circulation of commodities. The latter
can originally consist of only two components: 1) The circuit of capital
proper and 2) the circuit of the commodities which enter into individual
consumption, consequently of the commodities for which the labourer expends
his wages and the capitalist his surplus-value (or a part of it). At any
rate, the circuit of capital comprises also the circulation of the surplus-value,
since the latter is a part of the commodity capital, and likewise the conversion
of the variable capital into labour-power, the payment of wages. But the
expenditure of this surplus-value and wages for commodities does not form
a link in the circulation of capital, although at least the expenditure
of wages is essential for this circulation.</p>
<p>In Volume I the process of capitalist production was analysed as
an individual act as well as a process of reproduction: the production
of surplus-value and the production of capital itself. The changes of form
and substance experienced by capital in the sphere of circulation were
assumed without dwelling upon them. It was presupposed that on the one
hand the capitalist sells the product at its value and on the other that
he finds within the sphere of circulation the objective means of production
for restarting or continuing the process. The only act within the sphere
of circulation on which we have dwelt was the purchase and sale of labour-power
as the fundamental condition of capitalist production.</p>
<p>In the first part of this Book II, the various forms were considered
which capital assumes its circular movement, and the various forms of this
movement itself. The circulation time must now be added to the working
times discussed in Volume I.</p>
<p>In the second Part, the circuit was studied as being periodic,
i.e., as a turnover. It was shown on the one hand in what manner the various
constituents of capital (fixed and circulating) accomplish the circuit
of forms in different periods of time and in different ways; on the other
hand the circumstances were examined by which the different lengths of
the working period and circulation period are conditioned. The influence
was shown which the period of the circuit and the different proportions
of its component parts exert upon the dimensions of the production process
itself and upon the annual rate of surplus-value. Indeed, while it was
the successive forms continually assumed and discarded by capital in its
circuit that were studied in Part I, it was shown in Part II how a capital
of a given magnitude is simultaneously, though in varying proportions,
divided, within this flow and succession of forms, into different forms:
productive capital, money-capital, and commodity-capital, so that they
not only alternate with one another, but different portions of the total
capital-value are constantly side by side and function in these different
states. Especially money-capital came forward with distinctive features
not shown in Volume I. Certain laws were found according to which diverse
large components of a given capital must be continually advanced and renewed
— depending on the conditions of the turnover — in the form of money-capital in order to keep a productive capital of a given size constantly functioning.</p>
<p>But in both the first and the second Parts it was always only
a question of some individual capital, of the movement of some individualised
part of social capital.</p>
<p>However the circuits of the individual capitals intertwine, presuppose
and necessitate one another, and form, precisely in this interlacing, the
movement of the total social capital. Just as in the simple circulation
of commodities the total metamorphosis of a commodity appeared as a link
in the series of metamorphoses of the world of commodities, so now the
metamorphosis of the individual capital appears as a link in the series
of metamorphoses of the social capital. But while simple commodity circulation
by no means necessarily comprises the circulation of capital — since it
may take place on the basis of non-capitalist production — the circuit
of the aggregate social capital, as was noted, comprises also the commodity
circulation lying outside the circuit of individual capital, i.e., the
circulation of commodities which do not represent capital.</p>
<p>We have now to study the process of circulation (which in its
entirety is a form of the process of reproduction) of the individual capitals
as components of the aggregate social capital, that is to say, the process
of circulation of this aggregate social capital.

<h3>II. The Role of Money-Capital</h3>
<p class="fst">
[Although the following belongs in a later section of this Part, we
shall analyse it immediately, namely, the money-capital considered as a
constituent part of the aggregate social capital.]</p>
<p>In the study of the turnover of the individual capital money-capital
revealed two aspects.</p>
<p>In the first place it constitutes the form in which every individual
capital appears upon the scene and opens its process as capital. It therefore
appears as the <i>primus motor</i>, lending impetus to the entire process.</p>
<p>In the second place, that portion of the advanced capital-value
which must be continually advanced and renewed in the form of money differs
in its ratio to the productive capital which it sets in motion, i.e., in
its ratio to the continuous scale of production, depending on the particular
length of the period of turnover and the particular ratio between its two
component parts — the working period and the period of circulation. But
whatever this ratio may be, the portion of the capital-value in process
which can continually function as productive capital is limited in any
event by that portion of the advanced capital-value which must always exist
beside the productive capital in the form of money. It is here merely a
question of the normal turnover, an abstract average. Additional money-capital
required to compensate for interruptions of the circulation is excepted.</p>
<p><i>As to the first point</i>: commodity production presupposes commodity
circulation, and commodity circulation presupposes the expression of commodities
in money, the circulation of money; the splitting of a commodity into commodity
and money is law of the expression of the product as a commodity. Similarly
the capitalist production of commodities — whether considered socially
or individually — presupposes capital in the form of money, or money-capital,
both as the <i>primus motor</i> of every incipient business, and as its continual
motor. The circulating capital especially implies that the money-capital
acts with constant repetition at short intervals as a motor. The entire
advanced capital-value, that is to say, all the elements of capital, consisting
of commodities, labour-power, instruments of labour, and materials of production,
must be bought over and over again with money. What is true here of the
individual capital is also true of the social capital, which functions
only in the form of many individual capitals. But as we showed in Volume
I, it does not at all follow from this that capital’s field of operation,
the scale of production, depends — even on a capitalist basis — for its
<i>absolute</i> limits on the amount of functioning money-capital.</p>
<p>Incorporated in capital are elements of production whose expansion
within certain limits is independent of the magnitude of the advanced money-capital.
Though payment of labour-power be the same, it can be exploited more or
less extensively or intensively. If the money-capital is increased with
this greater exploitation (that is, if wages are raised), it is not increased
proportionately, hence not at all <i>pro tanto</i>.</p>
<p>The productively exploited nature-given materials — the soil,
the seas, ores, forests, etc. — which do not constitute elements of capital-value,
are more intensively or extensively exploited with a greater exertion of
the same amount of labour-power, without an increased advance of money-capital.
The real elements of productive capital are thus multiplied without requiring
an additional money-capital. But so far as such an addition becomes necessary
for additional auxiliary materials, the money-capital in which the capital-value
is advanced is not increased proportionately to the augmented effectiveness
of the productive capital, hence is <i>pro tanto</i> not at all increased.</p>
<p>The same instruments of labour, and thus the same fixed capital,
can be used more effectively by an extension of the time they are daily
used and by a greater intensity of employment, without an additional outlay
of money for fixed capital. There is, in that case, only a more rapid turnover
of the fixed capital, but then the elements of its reproduction are supplied
more rapidly.</p>
<p>Apart from the natural substances, it is possible to incorporate
in the productive process natural forces, which do not cost anything, to
act as agents with more or less heightened effect. The degree of their
effectiveness depends on methods and scientific developments which cost
the capitalist nothing.</p>
<p>The same is true of the social combination of labour-power in
the process of production and of the accumulated skill of the individual
labourers. Carey calculates that the landowner never receives enough, because
he is not paid for all the capital or labour put into the soil since time
immemorial in order to give it its present productivity. (Of course, no
mention is made of the productivity of which the soil is robbed.) According
to that each individual labourer would have to paid according to the work
which it cost the entire human race to evolve a modern mechanic out of
a savage. On the contrary one should think that if all the unpaid labour
put into the soil and converted into money by the landowner and capitalist
is totalled up, all the capital ever invested in this soil has been paid
back over and over again with usurious interest, so that society has long
ago redeemed landed property over and over again.</p>
<p>True enough, the increase in the productive power of labour, so
far as it does not imply an additional investment of capital-value, augments
in the first instance only the quantity of the product, not its value,
except insofar as it makes it possible to reproduce more constant capital
with the same labour and thus to preserve its value. But it forms at the
same time new material for capital, hence the basis of increased accumulation
of capital.</p>
<p>So far as the organisation of social labour itself, and thus the
increase in the social productive power of labour, requires large-scale
production and therefore the advance of large quantities of money-capital
by individual capitalists, we have shown in Book I [From Manuscript II.
— <i>F. E.</i>] that this is accomplished in part by the centralisation
of capitals in a few hands, without necessitating an absolute increase
in the magnitude of the functioning capital-values, and consequently also
in the magnitude of the money-capital in which they are advanced. The magnitude
of the individual capitals can increase by centralisation in the hands
of a few without a growth of their social sum total. It is only a changed
distribution of the individual capitals.</p>
<p>Finally, we have shown in the preceding Part that a shortening
of the period of turnover permits of setting in motion either the same
productive capital with less money-capital or more productive capital with
the same money-capital. [English edition: Vol. I, pp. 624-28, 761-64. —
<i>Ed</i>.]</p>
<p>But evidently all this has nothing to do with the question of
money-capital itself. It shows only that the advanced capital — a given
sum of values consisting in its free form, in its value-form, of a certain
sum of money — includes, after its conversion into productive capital,
productive powers whose limits are not set by the limits of its value,
but which on the contrary may operate within certain bounds with differing
degrees of extensiveness or intensiveness. If the prices of the elements
of production — the means of production and labour-power — are given,
the magnitude of the money-capital required for the purchase of a definite
quantity of these elements of production existing as commodities is determined.
Or the magnitude of value of the capital to be advanced is determined.
But the extent to which this capital acts as a creator of values and products
is elastic and variable.</p>
<p><i>As to the second point</i>: it is self-evident that part of the social
labour and means of production which must be annually expended for the
production or purchase of money in order to replace worn-off coin is <i>pro
tanto</i> a diminution of the volume of social production. But as for the money-value
which functions partly as a medium of circulation, partly as a hoard, it
is simply there, acquired, present alongside the labour-power, the produced
means of production, and the natural sources of wealth. It cannot be regarded
as a limit set to these things. By its transformation into elements of
production, by its exchange with other nations, the scale of production
might be extended. This presupposes, however, that money plays its role
of world-money the same as ever.</p>
<p>To set the productive capital in motion requires more or less
money-capital, depending on the length of the period of turnover. We have
also seen that the division of the period of turnover into working time
and circulation time requires an increase of the capital latent or suspended
in the form of money.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the period of turnover is determined by the length
of the working period, it is determined, other conditions remaining equal,
by the material nature of the process of production, hence not by the specific
social character of this process of production. However, on the basis of
capitalist production, more extensive operations of comparatively long
duration necessitate large advances of money-capital for a rather long
time. Production in such spheres depends therefore on the magnitude of
the money-capital which the individual capitalist has at his disposal.
This barrier is broken down by the credit system and the associations connected
with it, e.g., the stock companies. Disturbances in the money-market therefore
put such establishments out of business, while these same establishments,
in their turn, produce disturbances in the money-market.</p>
<p>On the basis of socialised production the scale must be ascertained
on which those operations — which withdraw labour-power and means of production for a long time without supplying any product as a useful effect in the
interim — can be carried on without injuring branches of production which
not only withdraw labour-power and means of production continually, or
several times a year, but also supply means of subsistence and of production.
Under socialised as well as capitalist production, the labourers in branches
of business with shorter working periods will as before withdraw products
only for a short time without giving any products in return; while branches
of business with long working periods continually withdraw products for
a longer time before they return anything. This circumstance, then, arises
from the material character of the particular labour-process, not from
its social form. In the case of socialised production the money-capital
is eliminated. Society distributes labour-power and means of production
to the different branches of production. The producers may, for all it
matters, receive paper vouchers entitling them to withdraw from the social
supplies of consumer goods a quantity corresponding to their labour-time.
These vouchers are not money. They do not circulate.</p>
<p>We see that inasmuch as the need for money-capital originates
in the length of the working period, it is conditioned by two things: <i>First</i>,
that money in general is the form in which every individual capital (apart
from credit) must make its appearance in order to transform itself into
productive capital; this follows from the nature of capitalist production
and commodity-production in general. <i>Second</i>, the magnitude of the required
money advance is due to the circumstance that labour-power and means of
production are continually withdrawn from society for a comparatively long
time without any return to it, during that period, of products convertible
into money. The first condition, that the capital to be advanced must be
advanced in the form of money, is not eliminated by the form of this money
itself, whether it is metal-money, credit-money, token-money, etc. The
second condition is in no way affected by what money-medium or in what
form of production labour, means of subsistence, and means of production
are withdrawn without the return of some equivalent to the circulation.

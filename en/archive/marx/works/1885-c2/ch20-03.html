<h5>XI. Replacement of the Fixed Capital</h5>
<p class="fst">
In the analysis of the exchanges of the annual reproduction the
following presents great difficulty. If we take the simplest form in which
the matter may be presented, we get:

<br><br>


I) 4,000<sub>c</sub> + 1,000<sub>v</sub> + l,000<sub>s</sub> +<br>
II) 2,000<sub>c</sub> + 500<sub>v</sub> + 500<sub>s</sub> = 9,000.


<br><br>


This resolves itself finally into:

<br><br>

4,000 I<sub>c</sub> + 2,000 II<sub>c</sub> + 1,000 I<sub>v</sub> + 500 II<sub>v</sub> + l,000 I<sub>s</sub> + 500 II<sub>s</sub><br>
= 6,000<sub>c</sub> + 1,500<sub>v</sub> + 1,500<sub>s</sub> = 9,000</p>
<p>
One portion of the value of the constant capital, which consists of
instruments of labour in the strict meaning of the term (as a distinct
section of the means of production) is transferred from the instruments
of labour to the product of labour (the commodity); these instruments of
labour continue to function as elements of the productive capital, doing
so in their old bodily form. It is their wear and tear, the depreciation
gradually experienced by them during their continual functioning for a
definite period which re-appears as an element of value of the commodities
produced by means of them, which is transferred from the
instrument of labour to the product of labour. With regard to the annual
reproduction therefore only such component parts of fixed capital will
from the first be given consideration as last longer than a year. If they
are completely worn out within the year they must be completely
replaced and renewed by the annual reproduction, and the point at issue
does not concern them at all. It may happen in the case of machines
and other more durable forms of fixed capital — and it frequently does
happen — that certain parts of them must be replaced lock, stock and
barrel within one year, although the building or machine in its entirety
lasts much longer. These parts belong in one category with the elements
of fixed capital which are to be replaced within one year.</p>
<p>
This element of the value of commodities must not be confused with
the costs of repair. If a commodity is sold, this value-element is turned
into money, the same as all others. But after it has been turned into
money, its difference from the other elements of value becomes
apparent. The raw and auxiliary materials consumed in the production of
commodities must be replaced in kind in order that the reproduction of
commodities may begin (or that the process of production of
commodities in general may be continuous). The labour-power spent on
them must also be renewed by fresh labour-power. Consequently the
money realised on the commodities must be continually reconverted into
these elements of the productive capital, from the money-form into the
commodity-form. It does not alter the matter if raw and auxiliary
materials for instance are bought at certain intervals in larger
quantities — so that they constitute productive supplies — and need not be
bought anew during certain periods; and therefore — as long as they
last — the money coming in through the sale of commodities, inasmuch
as it is meant for this purpose, may accumulate and this portion of constant
capital thus appears temporarily as money-capital whose active
function has been suspended. It is not a revenue-capital; it is productive
capital suspended in the form of money. The renewal of the means of
production must go on all the time, although the form of this renewal — 
with reference to the circulation — may vary. The new purchases, the
circulation operation by which they are renewed or replaced, may take
place at more or at less prolonged intervals: then a large amount may be
invested at one stroke, compensated by a corresponding productive
supply. Or the intervals between purchases may be small: then follows a
rapid succession of money expenditures in small doses, of small
productive supplies. This does not alter the matter itself. The same
applies to labour-power. Where production is carried on continuously
throughout the year on the same scale — continuous replacement of
consumed labour-power by new. Where work is seasonable, or different
portions of labour are applied at different periods, as in agriculture — 
corresponding purchases of labour-power, now in small, now in large
amounts. But the money proceeds realised from the sale of
commodities, so far as they turn into money that part of the commodity-value
which is equal to the wear and tear of fixed capital, are not re-converted
into that component part of the productive capital whose
diminution in value they cover. They settle down beside the productive
capital and persist in the form of money. This precipitation of money is
repeated, until the period of reproduction consisting of great or small
numbers of years has elapsed, during which the fixed element of
constant capital continues to function in the process of production in its
old bodily form. As soon as the fixed element, such as buildings,
machinery, etc., has been worn out, and can no longer function in the
process of production, its value exists alongside it fully replaced by
money, by the sum of money precipitations, the values which had been
gradually transferred from the fixed capital to the commodities in whose
production it participated and which had assumed the form of money as
a result of the sale of these commodities. This money then serves to
replace the fixed capital (or its elements, since its various elements have
different durabilities) in kind and thus really to renew this component
part of the productive capital. This money is therefore the money-form of
a part of the constant capital-value, namely of its fixed part. The
formation of this hoard is thus itself an element of the capitalist process
of reproduction; it is the reproduction and storing up — in the form of
money — of the value of fixed capital, or its several elements, until the
fixed capital has ceased to live and in consequence has given off its full
value to the commodities produced and must now be replaced in kind.
But this money loses only its form of a hoard and hence resumes its activity
in the process of reproduction of capital brought about by the
circulation as soon as it is reconverted into new elements of fixed capital
to replace those that died off.</p>
<p>
Just as simple commodity circulation is in no way identical with a
bare exchange of products, the conversion of the annual commodity-product
can in no way resolve itself into a mere unmediated mutual
exchange of its various components. Money plays a specific role in it,
which finds expression particularly in the manner in which the value of
the fixed capital is reproduced. (How different the matter would present
itself if production were collective and no longer possessed the form of
commodity production is left to a later analysis.)</p>
<p>
Should we now return to our fundamental scheme, we shall get the
following for class II: 2,000<sub>c</sub> + 500<sub>v</sub> + 500<sub>s</sub>. All the articles of consumption produced in the course of the year are in that case equal in
value to 3,000; and every one of the different commodity elements in
the total sum of the commodities is composed, so far as its value is
concerned, of ⅔<sub>c</sub> + 1/6<sub>v</sub> + 1/6<sub>s</sub>, or, in percentages, 66⅔<sub>c</sub> + 16⅔<sub>v</sub> +
16⅔<sub>s</sub>. The various kinds of commodities of class II may contain different proportions of constant capital. Likewise the fixed portion of the constant
capital may be different. The duration of the parts of the fixed capital
and hence the annual wear and tear, or that portion of value which they
transfer <i>pro rata</i> to the commodities in the production of which they
participate, may also differ. But that is immaterial here. As to the
process of social reproduction, it is only a question of exchange between
classes II and I. These two classes here confront each other only in their
social, mass relations. Therefore the proportional magnitude of part c of
the value of commodity-product II (the only one of consequence in the
question now being discussed) gives the average proportion if all the
branches of production classed under II are embraced.</p>
<p>
Every kind of commodity (and they are largely the same kinds) whose
aggregate value is classed under 2,000<sub>c</sub> + 500<sub>v</sub> + 500<sub>s</sub> is therefore equal in value to 66⅔%<sub>c</sub> + 16⅔%<sub>v</sub> + 16⅔%<sub>s</sub>. This applies to every
100 of the commodities, whether classed under c, v or s.</p>
<p>
The commodities in which the 2,000<sub>c</sub> are incorporated may be
further divided, in value, into:


<br><br>

1) 1,333⅓<sub>c</sub> + 333⅓<sub>v</sub> + 333⅓<sub>s</sub> = 2,000<sub>c</sub>;<br>
similarly 500<sub>v</sub> may be divided into:<br>
2) 333⅓<sub>c</sub> + 83⅓<sub>v</sub> + 83⅓<sub>s</sub> = 500<sub>v</sub>;<br>
and finally 500<sub>s</sub> may be divided into:<br>
3) 333⅓<sub>c</sub> + 83⅓<sub>v</sub> + 83⅓<sub>s</sub> = 500<sub>s</sub><br></p>
<p>
Now, if we add the c’s in 1), 2), and 3) we get 1,333⅓<sub>c</sub> + 333⅓<sub>c</sub> + 333⅓<sub>c</sub> = 2,000. Furthermore 333⅓<sub>v</sub> + 83⅓<sub>v</sub> + 83⅓<sub>v</sub> = 500.</p>
<p>
And the same in the case of s. The addition gives the same total value of
3,000, as above.</p>
<p>
The entire constant capital-value contained in the commodity mass II
representing a value of 3,000 is therefore comprised in 2,000<sub>c</sub>, and
neither 500<sub>v</sub> nor 500<sub>s</sub> hold an atom of it. The same is true of v and s respectively.</p>
<p>
In other words, the entire share of commodity mass II that represents
constant capital-value and therefore is reconvertible either into its bodily
or its money-form, exists in 2,000<sub>c</sub>. Everything referring to the exchange
of the constant value of commodities II is therefore confined to the
movement of 2,000 II<sub>c</sub>. And this exchange can be made only with I
(1,000<sub>v</sub> + 1,000<sub>s</sub>).</p>
<p>
Similarly, as regards class I, everything that bears in the exchange of
the constant capital-value of that class is to be confined to a
consideration of 4,000 I<sub>c</sub>.</p>
<a id="11.1"></a>
<h5>1. Replacement of the Wear and Tear Portion of the Value in the Form of Money</h5>
<p class="fst">
Now, if to start with we take

<table align="center" width="35%">
<tr><td class="text">I. 4,000<sub>c</sub> + </td><td class="text" colspan="2"><u>1,000<sub></sub></u>v<u> + 1,000</u><sub>s</sub></td><td class="textc"> </td></tr>
<tr><td class="text">II. . . . . . . . </td><td class="textc" colspan="2">2,000<sub>c</sub> + 500<sub>v</sub> + 500<sub>s</sub>,</td></tr>
</table>
<br><br>
the exchange of the commodities 2,000 II<sub>c</sub> for commodities of the same
value I (1,000<sub>v</sub> + 1,000<sub>s</sub>) would presuppose that the entire 2,000 II<sub>c</sub> are reconverted in kind into the natural elements of the constant capital of II, produced by I. But the commodity-value of 2,000, in which the
latter exists, contains an element making good the depreciation in value
of the fixed capital, which is not to be replaced immediately in kind but
converted into money, which gradually accumulates into a sum total
until the time for the renewal of the fixed capital in its bodily form
arrives. Every year registers the demise of fixed capital which must be
replaced in this or that individual business, or in this or that branch of
industry. In the case of one and the same individual capital, this or that
portion of its fixed capital must be replaced, since its different parts have
different durabilities. On examining annual reproduction, even on a
simple scale, i.e., disregarding all accumulation, we do not begin <i>ab
ovo</i>. The year which we study is one in the course of many; it is not the
first year after the birth of capitalist production. The various capitals
invested in the manifold lines of production of class II therefore differ in
age. Just as people functioning in these lines of production die annually,
so a host of fixed capitals expire annually and must be renewed in kind
out of the accumulated money-fund. Therefore the exchange of 2,000 II<sub>c</sub>
for 2,000 I<sub>(v + s)</sub> includes a conversion of 2,000 II<sub>c</sub> from its commodity-form (articles of consumption) into natural elements which consist not
only of raw and auxiliary materials but also of natural elements of fixed
capital, such as machinery, tools, buildings, etc. The wear and tear,
which must be replaced in money in the value of 2,000 II<sub>c</sub>, therefore by
no means corresponds to the amount of the functioning fixed capital,
since a portion of this must be replaced in kind every year. But this
assumes that the money necessary for this replacement was
accumulated in former years by the capitalists of class II. However that
very condition holds good in the same measure for the current year as
for the preceding ones.</p>
<p>
In the exchange between I (1,000<sub>v</sub> + 1,000<sub>s</sub>) and 2,000 II<sub>c</sub> it must be first noted that the sum of values I<sub>(v + s)</sub> does not contain any constant element of value, hence also no element of value to replace wear and tear, i.e., value that has been transmitted from the fixed component of
the constant capital to the commodities in whose bodily form v + s
exist. On the other hand this element exists in II<sub>c</sub>, and it is precisely a
part of this value-element that owes its existence to fixed capital which
is not to be converted immediately from the money-form into its bodily
form, but has first to persist in the form of money. The exchange
between I (1,000<sub>v</sub> + 1,000<sub>s</sub>) and 2,000 II<sub>c</sub>, therefore, at once presents the difficulty that the means of production of I, in whose bodily form the 2,000<sub>(v + s)</sub> exist, are to be exchanged to the full value of 2,000 for an equivalent in articles of consumption II, while on the other hand the
2,000 II<sub>c</sub> of articles of consumption cannot be exchanged at their full
value for means of production I (1,000<sub>v</sub> + 1,000<sub>s</sub>) because an aliquot part of their value — equal to the wear and tear, or the value depreciation
of the fixed capital that is to be replaced — must first be precipitated in
the form of money that will not function any more as a medium of
circulation during the current period of annual reproduction, which alone
we are examining. But the money paying for this element of wear and
tear incorporated in the commodity-value 2,000 II<sub>c</sub> can come only from
department I, since II cannot pay for itself but effects payment precisely
by selling its goods, and since presumably I<sub>(v + s)</sub> buys the whole of the
commodities 2,000 II<sub>c</sub>. Hence class I must by means of this purchase
convert that wear and tear into money for II. But according to the law
previously evolved, money advanced to the circulation returns to the
capitalist producer who later on throws an equal amount of commodities
into circulation. It is evident that in buying II<sub>c</sub>, I cannot give II
commodities worth 2,000 and a surplus amount of money on top of that
once and for all (without any return of the same by way of the operation
of exchange). Otherwise I would buy the commodity mass II above its
value. If II actually exchanges its 2,000<sub>c</sub> for I (1,000<sub>v</sub> + 1,000<sub>s</sub>), it has no further claims on I, and the money circulating in this exchange returns to either I or II, depending on which of them threw it into
circulation, i.e., which of them acted first as buyer. At the same time II
would have reconverted the entire value of its commodity-capital into the
bodily form of means of production, while our assumption is that after its
sale it would not reconvert an aliquot portion of it during the current
period of annual reproduction from money into the bodily form of fixed
components of its constant capital. A money balance in favour of II could
arise only if it sold 2,000 worth to I and bought less than 2,000 from I,
say only 1,800. In that case I would have to make good the debit
balance by 200 in money, which would not flow back to it, because it
would not have withdrawn from circulation the money it had advanced
to it by throwing into it commodities equal to 200. In such an event we
would have a money-fund for II, placed to the credit of the wear and tear
of its fixed capital. But then we would have an over-production of means
of production in the amount of 200 on the other side, the side of I, and
the basis of our scheme would be destroyed, namely reproduction on the
same scale, where complete proportionality between the various systems
of production is assumed. We would only have done away with one
difficulty in order to create another one much worse.</p>
<p>
As this problem offers peculiar difficulties and has hitherto not been
treated at all by the political economists, we shall examine <i>seriatim</i> all
possible (at least seemingly possible) solutions, or rather formulations of
the problem.</p>
<p>

In the first place, we have just assumed that II sells commodities of
the value of 2,000 to I, but buys from it only 1,800 worth. The
commodity-value 2,000 II<sub>c</sub> contains 200 for replacement of wear and
tear, which must be stored up in the form of money. The value of 2,000
II<sub>c</sub> would thus be divided into 1,800, to be exchanged for means of
production I, and 200, to replace wear and tear, which are to be kept in
the form of money (after the sale of the 2,000<sub>c</sub> to I). Expressed in terms
of value, 2,000 II<sub>c</sub> equals 1,800<sub>c</sub> + 200<sub>c</sub>(d), this d standing for <i>déchet</i>.
[<i>Wear and tear. — Ed.</i>]</p>
<p>
We would then have to study
<br><br>


Exchange I. 1,000<sub>v</sub> + 1,000<sub>s</sub><br>
II. 1,800<sub>c</sub> + 200<sub>c</sub>(d).

<br><br>
I buys with £1,000, which has gone to the labourers in wages for
their labour-power, 1,000 II<sub>c</sub> of articles of consumption. II buys with the
same £1,000 means of production 1,000 I<sub>v</sub>. Capitalists I thus recover
their variable capital in the form of money and can employ it next year in
the purchase of labour power to the same amount, i.e., they can replace
the variable portion of their productive capital in kind.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, II buys with advanced £400 means of production I<sub>s</sub>,
and I<sub>s</sub> buys with the same £400 articles of consumption II<sub>c</sub>. The £400 advanced to the circulation by the capitalists of II have thus returned to them, but only as an equivalent for sold commodities. I now buys
articles of consumption for advanced £400; II buys from I £400 worth
of means of production, whereupon these £400 flow back to I. So far,
then, the account is as follows:</p>
<p>
I throws into circulation l,000<sub>v</sub> + 800<sub>s</sub> in commodities; it furthermore throws into circulation, in money, £1,000 in wages and £400 for exchange with II. After the exchange has been made, I has 1,000<sub>v</sub> in
money, 800<sub>s</sub> exchanged for 800 II<sub>c</sub> (articles of consumption) and £400 in money.</p>
<p>
II throws into circulation 1,800<sub>c</sub> in commodities (articles of
consumption) and £400 in money. On the completion of the exchange it
has 1,800 in commodities I (means of production) and £400 in money.</p>
<p>
There still remain, on the side of I, 200<sub>s</sub> (in means of production)
and, on the side of II, 200<sub>c</sub>(d) (in articles of consumption).</p>
<p>
According to our assumption I buys with £200 the articles of
consumption c (d) of the value of 200. But II holds on to these £200
since 200 c (d) represent wear and tear, and are not to be immediately
reconverted into means of production. Therefore 200 I<sub>s</sub> cannot be sold.
One-fifth of the surplus-value I to be replaced cannot be realised, or
converted, from its bodily form of means of production into that of
articles of consumption.</p>
<p>
This not only contradicts our assumption of reproduction on a simple
scale; it is by itself not a hypothesis which would explain the
transformation of 200<sub>c</sub>(d) into money. It means rather that it cannot be
explained. Since it cannot be demonstrated in what manner 200<sub>c</sub>(d) can
be converted into money, it is assumed that I is obliging enough to do
the conversion just because it is not able to convert its own remainder of
200<sub>s</sub> into money. To conceive this as a normal operation of the
exchange mechanism is tantamount to the notion that £200 fall every
year from the clouds in order regularly to convert 200<sub>c</sub>(d) into money.</p>
<p>But the absurdity of such a hypothesis does not strike one at once if
I<sub>s</sub>, instead of appearing, as it does in this case, in its primitive mode of
existence — namely as a component part of the value of means of
production, hence as a component part of the value of commodities
which their capitalist producers must convert into money by sale — 
appears in the hands of the partners of the capitalists, for instance as
ground-rent in the hands of landowners or as interest in the bands of
moneylenders. But if that portion of the surplus-value of commodities
which the industrial capitalist has to yield as ground-rent or interest to
other co-owners of the surplus-value cannot be realised for a long time
by the sale of the commodities, then there is also an end to the payment
of rent and interest, and the landowners or recipients of interest cannot
therefore serve as <i>dei ex machina</i> to convert at pleasure definite portions
of the annual reproduction into money by spending rent and interest.
The same is true of the expenditures of all so-called unproductive
labourers — government officials, physicians, lawyers, etc., and others
who as members of the “general public” “serve” the political economists by explaining what they left unexplained.</p>
<p>
Nor does it improve matters if instead of direct exchange between I
and II — between the two major departments of capitalist producers — the
merchant is drawn in as mediator and helps to overcome all difficulties
with his “money.” In the present case for instance 200 I<sub>s</sub> must be definitively disposed of to the industrial capitalists of II. It may pass
through the hands of a number of merchants, but the last of them will
find himself, according to the hypothesis, in the same predicament, vis-
à-vis II, in which the capitalist producers of I were at the outset, i.e.,
they cannot sell the 200 I<sub>s</sub> to II. And this stalled purchase sum cannot
renew the same process with I.</p>
<p>
We see here that, aside from our real purpose, it is absolutely
necessary to view the process of reproduction in its basic form — in
which obscuring minor circumstances have been eliminated — in order to
get rid of the false subterfuges which furnish the semblance of
“scientific” analysis when the process of social reproduction is
immediately made the subject of the analysis in its complicated concrete
form.</p>
<p>
The law that when reproduction proceeds normally (whether it be on
a simple or on an extended scale) the money advanced by the capitalist
producer to the circulation must return to its point of departure (whether
the money is his own or borrowed) excludes once and for all the
hypothesis that 200 II<sub>c</sub>(d) is converted into money by means of money
advanced by I.</p>
<a id="11.2"></a>
<h5>2. Replacement of Fixed Capital in Kind</h5>
<p class="fst">
Having disposed of the hypothesis considered above, only such
possibilities remain as, besides replacing the wear-and-tear portion in
money, include also the replacement in kind of the wholly defunct fixed
capital.</p>
<p>

We assumed hitherto</p>
<p class="fst">
a) that £1,000 paid in wages by I are spent by the labourers for II<sub>c</sub> to
the same amount, i.e., that they buy articles of consumption with them.
It is merely a statement of fact that these £1,000 are advanced by I
in money. Wages must be paid in money by the respective capitalist
producers. This money is then spent by the labourers for articles of
consumption and serves the sellers of the articles of consumption as a
medium of circulation in the conversion of their constant capital from
commodity-capital into productive capital. True, it passes through many
channels (shopkeepers, house owners, tax collectors, unproductive labourers,
such as physicians, etc., who are needed by the labourer
himself) and hence it flows only in part directly from the hands of
labourers I into those of capitalist class II. Its flow may be retarded more
or less and the capitalist may therefore require a new money-reserve. All
this does not come under consideration in this basic form.</p>
<p class="fst">
b) We assumed that at one time I advances another £400 in money
for purchases from II and that this money returns to it, while at some
other time II advances £400 for purchases from I and likewise recovers
this money. This assumption must be made, for it would be arbitrary to
presuppose the contrary, that capitalist class I or II should one-sidedly
advance to the circulation of the money necessary for the exchange of
their commodities. Since we have shown under subtitle 1 that one
should reject as absurd the hypothesis that I would throw additional
money into the circulation in order to turn 200 II<sub>c</sub>(d) into money, it
would appear that there was left only the seemingly still more absurd
hypothesis that II itself was throwing the money into circulation, by
which that constituent portion of the value of its commodities is
converted into money which has to compensate the wear and tear of its
fixed capital. For instance that portion of value which is lost by the
spinning-machine of Mr. X in the process of production re-appears as a
portion of the value of the yarn. The loss which his spinning-machine
suffers in value, i.e., in wear and tear, on the one hand, should
accumulate in his hands as money on the other. Now supposing that X
buys £200 worth of cotton from Y and thus advances to the circulation
£200 in money. Y then buys from him £200 worth of yarn, and these
£200 now serve X as a fund to compensate the wear and tear of his
machine. The thing would simply come down to this — that X, aside from
his production, its product, and the sale of this product, keeps £200 <i>in
petto</i> to make good to himself the depreciation of his spinning-machine,
i.e., that in addition to losing £200 through the depreciation of his machine,
he must also put up another £200 in money every year out of his
own pocket in order to be able eventually to buy a new spinning-machine.</p>
<p>
But the absurdity is only apparent. Class II consists of capitalists
whose fixed capital is in the most diverse stages of its reproduction. In
the case of some of them it has arrived at the stage where it must be
entirely replaced in kind. In the case of the others it is more or less
remote from that stage. All the members of the latter group have this in
common, that their fixed capital is not actually reproduced, i.e., is not
renewed <i>in natura</i> by a new specimen of the same kind, but that its
value is successively accumulated in money. The first group is in quite
the same (or almost the same, it does not matter here) position as when
it started in business, when it came on the market with its money-capital
in order to convert it into constant (fixed and circulating) capital
on the one hand and into labour-power, into variable capital, on the
other. They have once more to advance this money-capital to the
circulation, i.e., the value of constant fixed capital as well as that of the
circulating and variable capital.</p>
<p>
Hence, if we assume that half of the £400 thrown into circulation by
capitalist class II for exchange with I comes from those capitalists of II
who have to renew not only by means of their commodities their means
of production pertaining to the circulating capital, but also, by means of
their money, their fixed capital in kind, while the other half of capitalists
II replaces in kind with its money only the circulating portion of its
constant capital, but does not renew in kind its fixed capital, then there
is no contradiction in the statement that these returning £400 (returning
as soon as I buys articles of consumption for it) are variously distributed
among these two sections of II. They return to class II, but they do not
come back into the same hands and are distributed variously within this
class, passing from one of its sections to another.</p>
<p>
One section of II has, besides the part of the means of production
covered in the long run by its commodities, converted £200 in money
into new elements of fixed capital in kind. As was the case at the start of
the business the money thus spent returns to this section from the
circulation only gradually over a number of years as the wear-and-tear
portion of the value of the commodities to be produced by this fixed
capital.</p>
<p>
The other section of II however did not get any commodities from I for
£200. But I pays it with the money which the first section of II spent for
elements of its fixed capital. The first section of II has its fixed capital-value
once more in renewed bodily form, while the second section is still
engaged in accumulating it in money-form for the subsequent
replacement of its fixed capital in kind.</p>
<p>
The basis on which we now have to proceed after the previous
exchanges is the remainder of the commodities still to be exchanged by
both sides: 400<sub>s</sub> on the part of I, and 400<sub>c</sub> on the part of II. <sup class="enote"><a href="#n44">[44]</a></sup> We
assume that II advances 400 in money for the exchange of these
commodities amounting to 800. One half of the 400 (equal to 200)
must be laid out under all circumstances by that section of II<sub>c</sub> which has
accumulated 200 in money as the wear-and-tear value and which has to
reconvert this money into the bodily form of its fixed capital.</p>
<p>
Just as constant capital-value, variable capital-value, and surplus-value — 
into which the value of commodity-capital II as well as I is
divisible — may be represented by special proportional shares of
commodities II and I respectively, so may, within the value of the
constant capital itself, that portion of the value which is not yet to be
converted into the bodily form of the fixed capital, but is rather to be
accumulated for the time being in the form of money. A certain quantity
of commodities II (in the present case therefore one half of the
remainder, or 200) is here only a vehicle of this wear-and-tear value,
which has to be precipitated in money by means of exchange. (The first
section of capitalists II, which renews fixed capital in kind, may already
have realised in this way — with the wear-and-tear part of the mass of
commodities of which here only the rest still figures — a part of its wear-and-tear value, but it still has to realise 200 in money.)</p>
<p>
As for the second half (equal to 200) of the £400 thrown into
circulation by II in this final operation, it buys circulating components of
constant capital from I. A portion of these £200 may be thrown into
circulation by both sections of II, or only by the one which does not
renew its fixed component of value in kind.</p>
<p>
With these £400 there is thus extracted from I: 1) commodities
amounting to £200, consisting only of elements of fixed capital; 2)
commodities amounting to £200, replacing only natural elements of the
circulating portion of the constant capital of II. So I has sold its entire
annual product, so far as it is to be sold to II; but the value of one-fifth of
it, £400, is now held by I in the form of money. This money however is
surplus-value converted into money which must be spent as revenue for
articles of consumption. Thus I buys with its £400 II’s entire
commodity-value equal to 400; hence this money flows back to II by
setting its commodities in motion.</p>
<p>
We shall now suppose three cases, in which we shall call the section
of capitalists II which replaces its fixed capital in kind “section 1,” and
that section which stores up depreciation-value from fixed capital in
money-form, “section 2.” The three cases are the following: a) that a
share of the 400 still existing with II as a remnant in the shape of
commodities must replace certain shares of the circulating parts of the
constant capital for sections 1 and 2 (say, one half for each); b) that
section 1 has already sold all its commodities, while section 2 still has
to sell 400; c) that section 2 has sold all but the 200 which are the
bearers of the depreciation value.</p>
<p>

Then we have the following distributions:</p>
<p class="fst">
a) Of the commodity-value 400<sub>c</sub>, still in the hands of II, section 1
holds 100 and section 2 — 300; 200 out of the 300 represent
depreciation. In that case section 1 originally laid out 300 of the £400
in money now returned by I to get commodities from II, namely 200 in
money, for which it secured elements of fixed capital in kind from I, and
100 in money for the promotion of its exchange of commodities with I.
Section 2 on the other hand advanced only ¼ of the 400, i.e., 100,
likewise for the promotion of its commodity-exchange with I.</p>
<p>
Section 1, then, advanced 300, and section 2 — 100 of the 400 in
money.</p>
<p>
Of these 400 there return however:</p>
<p>
To section 1 — 100 i.e., only one-third of the money advanced by it.
But it has in place of the other ⅔ a renewed fixed capital to the value of
200. Section l has given money to I for this element of fixed capital to
the value of 200, but no subsequent commodities. So far as the 200 in
money are concerned, section 1 confronts department I only as buyer,
but not later on as seller. This money cannot therefore return to section
1; otherwise it would have received the elements of fixed capital from I
as a gift.</p>
<p>

With reference to the last third of the money advanced by it, section
1 first acted as a buyer of circulating constituent parts of its constant
capital. With the same money I buys from it the remainder of its
commodities worth 100. This money, then, flows back to it (section 1 of
department II) because it acts as a vendor of commodities directly after
having acted as a buyer. If this money did not return, then II (section 1)
would have given to I, for commodities amounting to 100, first 100 in
money, and then into the bargain, 100 in commodities, i.e., II would
have given away its commodities to I as a present.</p>
<p>
On the other hand section 2, which laid out 100 in money receives
back 300 in money: 100 because first as a buyer it threw 100 in money
into circulation, and receives them back as a seller; 200, because it
functions only as a seller of commodities to that amount, but not as a
buyer. Hence the money cannot flow back to I. The fixed capital
depreciation is thus balanced by the money thrown into circulation by II
(section 1) in the purchase of elements of fixed capital. But it reaches
the hands of section 2 not as money of section 1, but as money
belonging to class I.</p>
<p class="fst">
b) On this assumption the remainder of II is so distributed that
section 1 has 200 in money and section 2 has 400 in commodities.</p>
<p>Section 1 has sold all of its commodities, but 200 in money are a
transformed shape of the fixed component part of its constant capital
which it has to renew in kind. Hence it acts here only as a buyer and
receives instead of its money commodity I to the same value in natural
elements of its fixed capital. Section 2 has to throw only £200 into
circulation, as a maximum (if I does not advance any money for
commodity-exchange between I and II), since for half of its commodity-value
it is only a seller to I, not a buyer from I. </p>
<p>
There return to section 2 from the circulation £400: 200, because it
has advanced them as a buyer and receives them back as a seller of
200 in commodities; 200, because it sells commodities to the value of
200 to I without obtaining an equivalent in commodities from I.</p>
<p class="fst">
c) Section 1 has 200 in money and 200 in commodities. Section 2
has 200 c (d) in commodities.</p>
<p>

On this supposition section 2 does not have any advance to make in
money, because vis-à-vis I it no longer acts at all as buyer but only as
seller, hence has to wait until someone buys from it.</p>
<p>
Section 1 advances £400 in money: 200 for mutual commodity-exchange
with I, 200 as mere buyer from I. With the last £200 in
money it purchases the elements of fixed capital.</p>
<p>
With £200 in money I buys from section 1 commodities for 200, so
that the latter thus recovers the £200 in money it had advanced for this
commodity-exchange. And I buys with the other £200, which it has
likewise received from section 1, commodities to the value of 200 from
section 2, whereby the latter’s wear and tear of fixed capital is
precipitated in the form of money.</p>
<p>
The matter is not altered in the least if it is assumed that, in case c),
class I instead of II (section 1) advances the 200 in money to promote
the exchange of the existing commodities. If I buys in that event first
200 in commodities from II, section 2, on the assumption that this
section has only this commodity remnant left to sell — then the £200 do
not return to I, since II, section 2, does not act again as buyer. But II,
section 1, has in that case £200 in money to spend in buying and 200
in commodities for exchange purposes, thus making a total of 400 for
trading with I, £200 in money then return to I from II, section 1. If I
again lays them out in the purchase of 200 in commodities from II,
section 1, they return to I as soon as II, section 1, takes the second half
of the 400 in commodities off I’s hands. Section 1 (II) has spent £200
in money as a mere buyer of elements of fixed capital; they therefore do
not return to it, but serve to turn the 200<sub>c</sub>, the commodity remnant of II,
section 2, into money, while the £200, the money laid out by I for the
exchange of commodities, return to I via II, section 1, not via II, section
2. In the place of its commodities of 400 there has returned to it a
commodity equivalent amounting to 400; the £200 in money advanced
by it for the exchange of 800 in commodities have likewise returned to
it. Everything is therefore all right.</p>
<hr class="section"/>
<p class="fst">
The difficulty encountered in the exchange</p>
<center><img align="middle" alt="equation" height="35" src="627.gif" width="90"/></center>
<p class="fst">
was reduced to the difficulty on exchanging
remainders:
<br><br>
I. ............400<sub>s</sub>.<br>
II. (1) 200 in money + 200<sub>c</sub> in commodities + (2) 200<sub>c</sub> in<br>

commodities. Or, to make the matter still clearer:<br>
I. 200<sub>s</sub> + 200<sub>s</sub>.<br>
II. (1) 200 in money + 200<sub>c</sub> in commodities + (2) 200<sub>c</sub> in commodities.</p>
<p>
Since in II, section 1, 200<sub>c</sub> in commodities are exchanged for 200 I<sub>s</sub> (in commodities) and since all the money circulating in this exchange of
400 in commodities between I and II returns to him who advanced it, I
or II, this money, being an element of the exchange between I and II, is
actually not an element of the problem which is troubling us here. Or, to
present it differently: Supposing in the exchange between 200 I<sub>s</sub>
(commodities) and 200 II<sub>c</sub> (commodities of II, section 1) the money
functions as a means of payment, not as a means of purchase and
therefore also not as a “medium of circulation,” in the strictest sense of
the words. It is then clear, since the commodities 200 I<sub>s</sub> and 200 II<sub>c</sub> (section 1) are equal in magnitude of value, that means of production
worth 200 are exchanged for articles of consumption worth 200, that
money functions here only ideally, and that neither side really has to
throw any money into the circulation for the payment of any balance.
Hence the problem presents itself in its pure form only when we strike
off on both sides, I and II, the commodities 200 I<sub>s</sub> and their equivalent,
the commodities 200 II<sub>c</sub> (section 1).</p>
<p>
After the elimination of these two amounts of commodities of equal
value (I and II), which balance each other, there is left for exchange a
remainder in which the problem evinces its pure form, namely,</p>
<p class="fst">
I. 200<sub>s</sub> in commodities.</p>
<p class="fst">
II. (1) 200<sub>c</sub> in money plus (2) 200<sub>c</sub> in commodities.</p>
<p>
It is evident here that II, section 1, buys with 200 in money the
component parts of its fixed capital, 200 I<sub>s</sub>. The fixed capital of II,
section 1, is thereby renewed in kind and the surplus-value of I, worth
200, is converted from the commodity-form (means of production, or,
more precisely, elements of fixed capital) into the money-form. With
this money I buys articles of consumption from II, section 2, and the
result for II is that for section I a fixed component part of its constant
capital has been renewed in kind, and that for section 2 another
component part (which compensates for the depreciation of its fixed
capital) has been precipitated in money-form. And this continues every
year until this last component part, too, has to be renewed in kind.</p>
<p>
The condition precedent is here evidently that this fixed component
part of constant capital II, which is reconverted into money to the full
extent of its value and therefore must be renewed in kind each year
(section 1), should be equal to the annual depreciation of the other fixed
component part of constant capital II, which continues to function in its
old bodily form and whose wear and tear, depreciation in value, which it
transfers to the commodities in whose production it is engaged, is first to
be compensated in money. Such a balance would seem to be a law of
reproduction on the same scale. This is equivalent to saying that in class
I, which puts out the means of production, the proportional division of
labour must remain unchanged, since it produces on the one hand
circulating and on the other fixed component parts of the constant
capital of department II.</p>
<p>
Before we analyse this more closely we must see what turn the
matter takes if the remainder of II<sub>c</sub> (1) is not equal to the remainder of II<sub>c</sub> (2), and may be larger or smaller. Let us study the two cases one after
the other.</p>
<h5>First Case</h5>
<p class="fst">
I. 200<sub>s</sub>.</p>
<p class="fst">
II. (1) 220<sub>c</sub> (in money) plus (2) 200<sub>c</sub> (in commodities).</p>
<p>
In this case II<sub>c</sub> (1) buys with £200 in money the commodities 200 I<sub>s</sub>, and I buys with the same money the commodities 200 II<sub>c</sub> (2), i.e., that portion of the fixed capital which is to be precipitated in money. This
portion is thus converted into money. But 20 II<sub>c</sub> (1) in money cannot be
reconverted into fixed capital in kind.</p>
<p>
It seems this misfortune can be remedied by setting the remainder of
I<sub>s</sub> at 220 instead of at 200, so that only 1,780 instead of 1,800 of the
2,000 I would be disposed of by former exchange. We should then
have:</p>
<p class="fst">
I. 220<sub>s</sub>.</p>
<p class="fst">
II. (1) 220<sub>c</sub> (in money) plus (2) 200<sub>c</sub> (in commodities).</p>
<p>
II<sub>c</sub>, section 1, buys with £220 in money the 220 I<sub>s</sub> and I buys then with £200 the 200 II<sub>c</sub> (2) in commodities. But now £20 in money remain on the side of I, a portion of surplus-value which it can hold on to only in the form of money, without being able to spend it for articles
of consumption. The difficulty is thus merely transferred from II<sub>c</sub>, section
1, to I<sub>s</sub>.</p>
<p>
Let us now assume on the other hand that II<sub>c</sub>, section 1, is smaller
than II<sub>c</sub>, section 2: then we have the</p>
<h5>Second Case</h5>
<p class="fst">
I. 200<sub>s</sub> (in commodities).</p>
<p class="fst">
I. (1) 180<sub>c</sub> (in money) plus (2) 200<sub>c</sub> (in commodities).</p>
<p>
With £180 in money II (section 1) buys commodities, 180 I<sub>s</sub>. With
this money I buys commodities of the same value from II (section 2),
hence 180 II<sub>c</sub> (2). There remain 20 I<sub>s</sub> unsaleable on one side, and also 20 II<sub>c</sub> (2) on the other — commodities worth 40, not convertible into money.</p>
<p>
It would not help us to make the remainder of I equal to 180. True,
no surplus would then be left in 1, but now as before a surplus of 20
would remain in II<sub>c</sub> (section 2), unsaleable, inconvertible into money.
In the first case, where II (1) is greater than II (2), there remains on
the side of II<sub>c</sub> (1) a surplus in money-form not reconvertible into fixed
capital; or, if the remainder I<sub>s</sub> is assumed to be equal to II<sub>c</sub> (1), there remains on the side of I<sub>s</sub> the same surplus in money-form, not
convertible into articles of consumption.</p>
<p>
In the second case, where II<sub>c</sub> (1) is smaller than II<sub>c</sub> (2), there remains a money deficit on the side of 200 I<sub>s</sub> and II<sub>c</sub> (2), and an equal surplus of commodities on both sides, or, if the remainder of I<sub>s</sub> is assumed to be equal to II<sub>c</sub> (1), there remains a money deficit and a surplus of commodities on the side of II<sub>c</sub> (2).</p>
<p>
If we assume the remainders of I, always to be equal to II<sub>c</sub> (1) — since production is determined by orders and reproduction is not altered in any
way if one year there is a greater output of fixed component parts and
the next a greater output of circulating component part of constant
capitals II and I — then in the first case I<sub>s</sub> can be reconverted into articles of consumption only if I buys with it a portion of the surplus-value of II
and II accumulates it in money instead of consuming it; and in the
second case matters can be remedied only if I spends the money itself,
an assumption we have already rejected.</p>
<p>
If II<sub>c</sub> (1) is greater than II<sub>c</sub> (2), foreign commodities must be imported to realise the money-surplus in I<sub>s</sub>. If, conversely, II<sub>c</sub> (1) is smaller than II<sub>c</sub> (2), commodities II (articles of consumption) will have to be exported to realise the depreciation part of II<sub>c</sub> in means of production. Consequently in either case foreign trade is necessary.</p>
<p>
Even granted that for a study of reproduction on an unchanging scale
it is to be supposed that the productivity of all lines of industry, hence
also the proportional value-relations of their commodities, remain
constant, the two last-named cases, in which II<sub>c</sub> (1) is either greater or
smaller than II<sub>c</sub> (2), will nevertheless always be of interest for production
on an enlarged scale where these cases may infallibly be encountered.</p>
<a id="11.3"></a>
<h5>3. Results</h5>
<p class="fst">
The following is to be noted with reference to replacement of fixed
capital:</p>
<p>
If — all other things, and not only the scale of production, but above
all the productivity of labour, remaining the same — a greater part of the
fixed element of II<sub>c</sub> expires than did the year before, and hence a greater
part must be renewed in kind, then that part of the fixed capital which is
as yet only on the way to its demise and is to be replaced meanwhile in
money until its day of expiry, must shrink in the same proportion,
inasmuch as it was assumed that the sum (and the sum of the value) of
the fixed part of capital functioning in II remains the same. This however
brings with it the following circumstances. <i>First</i>: If the greater part of
commodity-capital I consists of elements of the fixed capital of II<sub>c</sub>, then a
correspondingly smaller portion consists of circulating component parts
of II<sub>c</sub>, because the total production of I for II<sub>c</sub> remains unchanged. If one of these parts increases the other decreases, and vice versa. On the
other hand the total production of class II also retains the same volume.
But how is this possible if its raw materials, semi-finished products, and
auxiliary materials (i.e., the circulating elements of constant capital II)
decrease? <i>Second</i>: the greater part of fixed capital II<sub>c</sub>, restored in its money-form, flows to I to be reconverted from its money-form into its
bodily form. So there is a greater flow of money to I, aside from the
money circulating between I and II merely for the exchange of their
commodities; more money which is not instrumental in effecting mutual
commodity exchange, but acts only one-sidedly in the function of a
means of purchase. But then the mass of commodities of II<sub>c</sub>, which is
the bearer of the wear-and-tear equivalent — and thus the mass of
commodities II that must only be exchanged for money I and not for
commodities I — would also shrink proportionately. More money would
have flown from II to I as mere means of purchase, and there would be
fewer commodities II in relation to which I would have to function as a
mere buyer. A greater portion of I<sub>s</sub>  — for I<sub>v</sub> is already converted into commodities II — would not therefore be convertible into commodities II, but would persist in the form of money.</p>
<p>
The opposite case, in which the reproduction of demises of fixed
capital II in a certain year is less and on the contrary the depreciation
part greater, needs no further discussion.</p>
<p>
There would be a crisis — a crisis of over-production — in spite of
reproduction on an unchanging scale.</p>
<p>
In short, if under simple reproduction and other unchanged
conditions — particularly under unchanged productive power, total
volume and intensity of labour — no constant proportion is assumed
between expiring fixed capital (to be renewed) and fixed capital still
continuing to function in its old bodily form (merely adding to the
products value in compensation of its depreciation), then, in the one
case the mass of circulating component parts to be reproduced would
remain the same while the mass of fixed component parts to be
reproduced would be increased. Therefore the total production I would
have to grow or, even aside from money-relations, there would be a
deficit in reproduction.</p>
<p>
In the other case, if the size of fixed capital II to be reproduced in
kind should proportionately decrease and hence the component part of
fixed capital II, which must now be replaced only in money, should
increase in the same ratio, then the quantity of the circulating
component parts of constant capital II reproduced by I would remain
unchanged, while that of the fixed component parts to be reproduced
would decrease. Hence either decrease in aggregate production of I, or
surplus (as previously deficit) and surplus that is not to be converted into
money.</p>
<p>
True, the same labour can, in the first case, turn out a greater
product through increasing productivity, extension or intensity, and the
deficit could thus be covered in that case. But such a change would not
take place without a shifting of capital and labour from one line of
production of I to another, and every such shift would call forth
momentary disturbances. Furthermore (in so far as extension and
intensification of labour would mount), I would have for exchange more
of its own value for less of II’s value. Hence there would be a
depreciation of the product of I.</p>
<p>
The reverse would take place in the second case, where I must curtail
its production, which implies a crisis for its labourers and capitalists, or
produce a surplus, which again spells crisis. Such surplus is not an evil
in itself, but an advantage; however it is an evil under capitalist
production.</p>
<p>
Foreign trade could help out in either case: in the first case in order to
convert commodities I held in the form of money into articles of
consumption, and in the second case to dispose of the commodity
surplus. But since foreign trade does not merely replace certain elements
(also with regard to value), it only transfers the contradictions to a wider
sphere and gives them greater latitude.</p>
<p>
Once the capitalist form of reproduction is abolished, it is only a
matter of the volume of the expiring portion — expiring and therefore to
be reproduced in kind — of fixed capital (the capital which in our
illustration functions in the production of articles of consumption)
varying in various successive years. If it is very large in a certain year (in
excess of the average mortality, as is the case with human beings), then
it is certainly so much smaller in the next year. The quantity of raw
materials, semi-finished products, and auxiliary materials required for
the annual production of the articles of consumption — provided other
things remain equal — does not decrease in consequence. Hence the
aggregate production of means of production would have to increase in
the one case and decrease in the other. This can be remedied only by a
continuous relative over-production. There must be on the one hand a
certain quantity of fixed capital produced in excess of that which is
directly required; on the other hand, and particularly, there must be a
supply of raw materials, etc., in excess of the direct annual requirements
(this applies especially to means of subsistence). This sort of over-production
is tantamount to control by society over the material means
of its own reproduction. But within capitalist society it is an element of
anarchy.</p>
<p>
This illustration of fixed capital, on the basis of an unchanged scale of
reproduction, is striking. A disproportion of the production of fixed and
circulating capital is one of the favourite arguments of the economists in
explaining crises. That such a disproportion can and must arise even
when the fixed capital is merely preserved, that it can and must do so
on the assumption of ideal normal production on the basis of simple
reproduction of the already functioning social capital is something new
to them.</p>

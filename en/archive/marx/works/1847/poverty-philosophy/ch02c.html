M. Proudhon begins by defending the eternal necessity
of competition against those who wish to replace it by <i>emulation</i>
[Engels: The Fourierists].</p>
<p class="quoteb">There is no “purposeless emulation,” and as “the object of every passion
is necessarily analogous to the passion itself – a woman for the lover,
power for the ambitious, gold for the miser, a garland for the poet –
the object of industrial emulation is necessarily profit. Emulation is
nothing but competition itself.” </p>
<p class="inline">[I 187]

</p>
<p>
Competition is emulation with a view to profit. Is industrial emulation
necessarily emulation with a view to profit, that is, competition?? M.
Proudhon proves it by affirming it. We have seen that, for him, to affirm
is to prove, just as to suppose is to deny.</p>
<p>If the immediate <i>object</i> of the lover is the woman, the
immediate object of industrial emulation is the product and not the profit.</p>
<p>Competition is not industrial emulation, it is commercial emulation.
In our time industrial emulation exists only in view of commerce. There
are even phases in the economic life of modern nations when everybody is
seized with a sort of craze for making profit without producing. This speculation
craze, which recurs periodically, lays bare the true character of competition,
which seeks to escape the need for industrial emulation.</p>
<p>If you had told an artisan of the 14th century that the privileges
and the whole feudal organization of industry were going to be abrogated
in favor of industrial emulation, called competition, he would have replied
that the privileges of the various corporations, guilds and fraternities
were organized competition. M. Proudhon does not impose upon this when
he affirms that “emulation is nothing but competition itself.” </p>
<p class="quoteb">“Decree that from the first of January 1847, labor and wages shall
be guaranteed to everybody: immediately an immense relaxation will succeed
the high tension of industry.” </p>
<p class="inline">[I 189]</p>
<p>
Instead of a supposition, an affirmation and a negation, we have now a
decree that M. Proudhon issues purposely to prove the necessity of competition,
its eternity as a category, etc.</p>
<p>If we imagine that decrees are all that is needed to get away
from competition, we shall never get away from it. And if we go so far
as to propose to abolish competition while retaining wages, we shall be
proposing nonsense by royal decree. But nations do not proceed by royal
decree. Before framing such ordinances, they must at least have changed
from top to bottom the conditions of their industrial and political existence,
and consequently their whole manner of being.</p>
<p>M. Proudhon will reply, with his imperturbable assurance, that
it is the hypothesis of “a transformation of our nature without historical
antecedents,” and that he would be right in “excluding is from the discussion,” 
we know not in virtue of which ordinance.</p>
<p>M. Proudhon does not know that all history is nothing but a continuous
transformation of human nature.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Let us stick to the facts. The French Revolution was made for industrial
liberty as much as for political liberty; and although France, in 1789,
had not perceived – let us say it openly – all the consequences of the
principle whose realization it demanded, it was mistaken neither in its
wishes nor in its expectations. Whoever attempts to deny this loses, in
my view, the right to criticism. I will never dispute with an adversary
who puts as principle the spontaneous error of 25 million men....</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Why then, if competition had not been a principle of social economy,
a decree of fate, a necessity of the human soul, why, instead of abolishing
corporations, guilds and brotherhoods, did nobody think rather of repairing
the whole??” </p>
<p class="inline">[I 191, 192]</p>
<p>
So, since the French of the 18th century abolished corporations, guilds,
and fraternities instead of modifying them, the French of the 19th century
must modify competition instead of abolishing it. Since competition was
established in France in the 18th century as a result of historical needs,
this competition must not be destroyed in the 19th century because of other
historical needs. M. Proudhon, not understanding that the establishment
of competition was bound up with the actual development of the men of the
18th century, makes of competition a necessity of the <i>human soul</i>,
in <i>partibus infidelium</i> <span class="inote">[literally, “territory of the infidels”; here,
meaning, “beyond the realm of reality.”]</span> What would he have made of the
great Colbert for the 17th century??</p>
<p>After the revolution comes the present state of affairs. M. Proudhon
equally draws facts from it to show the eternity of competition, by proving
that all industries in which this category is not yet sufficiently developed,
as in agriculture, are in a state of inferiority and decrepitude.

<p>To say that there are industries which have not yet reached the
stage of competition, that others gains are below the level of bourgeois
production, is drivel which gives not the slightest proof of the eternity
of competition.</p>
<p>All M. Proudhon’s logic amounts to is this: competition is a social
relation in which we are now developing our productive forces. To this
truth, he gives no logical development, but only forms, often very well
developed, when he says that competition is industrial emulation, the present-day
mode of freedom, responsibility in labor, constitution of value, a condition
for the advent of equality, a principle of social economy, a decree of
fate, a necessity of the human soul, an inspiration of eternal justice,
liberty in division, division on liberty, an economic category.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Competition and association support each other. Far from excluding
each other they are not even divergent. Whoever says competition already
supposes a common aim. Competition is therefore not egoism, and the most
deplorable error committed by socialism is to have regarded it as the
overthrow of society.” </p>
<p class="inline">[I 223]</p>
<p>
Whoever says competition says common aim, and that proves, on the one hand,
that competition is association; on the other, that competition is not
egoism. And whoever says <i>egoism</i>, does he not say common aim?? Every
egoism operates in society and by the fact of society. Hence it presupposes
society, that is to say, common aims, common needs, common means of production,
etc., etc. Is it, then, be mere chance that the competition and association
which the Socialists talk about are not even divergent??</p>
<p>Socialists know well enough that present-day society is founded
on competition. How could they accuse competition of overthrowing present-day
society which they want to overthrow themselves?? And how could they accuse
competition of overthrowing the society to come, in which they see, on
the contrary, the overthrow of competition??</p>
<p>M. Proudhon says, later on, that competition is the <i>opposite
of monopoly</i>, and consequently cannot be the <i>opposite of association</i>.</p>
<p>Feudalism was, from its origins, opposed to patriarchal monarchy;
it was thus not opposed to competition, which was not yet in existence.
Does it follow that competition is not opposed to feudalism??</p>
<p>In actual fact, <i>society</i>, <i>association</i> are denominations
which can be given to every society, to feudal society as well as to bourgeois
society which is association founded on competition. How then can there
be Socialists, who, by the single word <i>association</i>, think they can
refute competition?? And how can M. Proudhon himself wish to defend competition
against socialism by describing competition by the single word <i>association</i>??</p>
<p>All we have just said makes up the beautiful side of competition
as M. Proudhon sees it. Now let us pass on to the ugly side, that is the
negative side, of competition, its drawbacks, its destructive, subversive
elements, its injurious qualities.</p>
<p>There is something dismal about the picture M. Proudhon draws
of it.</p>
<p>Competition engenders misery, it foments civil war, it “changes
natural zones,” mixes up nationalities, causes trouble in families, corrupts
the public conscience, “subverts the notion of equity, of justice,” of
morality, and what is worse, it destroys free, honest trade, and does not
even give in exchange <i>synthetic value</i>, fixed, honest price. It disillusions
everyone, even economists. It pushes things so far as to destroy its very
self.</p>
<p>After all the ill M. Proudhon says of it, can there be for the
relations of bourgeois society, for its principles and its illusions, a
more disintegrating, more destructive element than competition??</p>
<p>It must be carefully noted that competition always becomes the
more destructive for bourgeois <i>relations</i> in proportion as it urges
on a feverish creation of new productive forces, that is, of the material
conditions of a new society. In this respect at least, the bad side of
competition would have its good points.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Competition as an economic position or phase, considered in its origin,
is the necessary result... of the theory of the reduction of general expenses.” </p>
<p class="inline">[I 235]

</p>
<p>
For M. Proudhon, the circulation of the blood must be a consequence of
Harvey’s theory.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Monopoly is the inevitable end of competition, which engenders it
by a continual negation of itself. This generation of monopoly is in itself
a justification of it....</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Monopoly is the natural opposite of competition... but as soon
as competition is necessary, it implies the idea of monopoly, since monopoly
is, as it were, the seat of each competing individuality.” </p>
<p class="inline">[I 236, 237]</p>
<p>
We rejoice with M. Proudhon that he can for once at least properly apply
his formula to thesis and antithesis. Everyone knows that modern monopoly
is engendered by competition itself.</p>
<p>As for the content, M. Proudhon clings to poetic images. Competition
made “of every subdivision of labor a sort of sovereignty in which each
individual stood with his power and his independence.” Monopoly is “the
seat of every competing individuality.” The sovereignty is worth at least
as much as the seat.</p>
<p>M. Proudhon talks of nothing but modern monopoly engendered by
competition. But we all know that competition was engendered by feudal
monopoly. Thus competition was originally the opposite of monopoly and
not monopoly the opposite of competition. So that modern monopoly is not
a simple antithesis, it is on the contrary the true synthesis.</p>
<p><i>Thesis</i>: Feudal monopoly, before competition.</p>
<p><i>Antithesis</i>: Competition.</p>
<p><i>Synthesis</i>: Modern monopoly, which is the negation of feudal monopoly,
in so far as it implies the system of competition, and the negation of
competition in so far as it is monopoly.</p>
<p>Thus modern monopoly, bourgeois monopoly, is synthetic monopoly,
the negation of the negation, the unity of opposites. It is monopoly in
the pure, normal, rational state.</p>
<p>M. Proudhon is in contradiction with his own philosophy when he
turns bourgeois monopoly into monopoly in the crude, primitive, contradictory,
spasmodic state. M. Rossi, whom M. Proudhon quotes several times on the
subject of monopoly, seems to have a better grasp of the synthetic character
of bourgeois monopoly. In his <i>Cours d’economie politique</i>, he distinguishes
between artificial monopolies and natural monopolies. Feudal monopolies,
he says, are artificial, that is, arbitrary; bourgeois monopolies are natural,
that is, rational.</p>
<p>Monopoly is a good thing, reasons M. Proudhon, since it is an
economic category, an emanation “from the impersonal reason of humanity.”
Competition, again, is a good thing since it also is an economic category.
But what is not good is the reality of monopoly and the reality of competition.
What is still worse is that competition and monopoly devour each other.
What is to be done?? Look for the synthesis of these two eternal thoughts,
wrest it from the bosom of God, where is has been deposited from time immemorial.</p>
<p>In practical life we find not only competition, monopoly and the
antagonism between them, but also the synthesis of the two, which is not
a formula, but a movement. Monopoly produces competition, competition produces
monopoly. Monopolists are made from competition; competitors become monopolists.
If the monopolists restrict their mutual competition by means of partial
associations, competition increases among the workers; and the more the
mass of the proletarians grows as against the monopolists of one nation,
the more desperate competition becomes between the monopolists of different
nations. The synthesis is of such a character that monopoly can only maintain
itself by continually entering into the struggle of competition.</p>
<p>To make the dialectical transition to the <i>taxes</i> which come
after <i>monopoly</i>, M. Proudhon talks to us about the <i>social
genius</i> which, after <i>zigzagging intrepidly onward</i>,</p>
<p class="quoteb">“after striding with a jaunty step, <i>without repenting</i> and without 
halting, <i>reaches the corner of monopoly</i>, casts backward a <i>melancholy</i> glance,
and, after profound reflection, assails all the objects of production with
taxes, and creates a whole administrative organization, in order that <i>all
employments be given to the proletariat</i> and paid by the men of monopoly.” </p>
<p class="inline">[I 284, 285]</p>
<p>
What can we say of this genius, which, while fasting, walks about in a
zigzag?? And what can we say of this walking which has no other object
in view than that of destroying the bourgeois by taxes, whereas taxes are
the very means of giving the bourgeois the wherewithal to preserve themselves
as the ruling class??</p>
<p>Merely to give a glimpse of the manner in which M. Proudhon treats
economic details, it suffices to say that, according to him, the tax on
consumption was established with a view to equality, and to relieve the
proletariat.</p>
<p>The tax on consumption has assumed its true development only since
the rise of the bourgeoisie. In the hands of industrial capital, that is,
of sober and economical wealth, which maintains, reproduces, and increases
itself by the direct exploitation of labor, the tax on consumption was
a means of exploiting the frivolous, gay, prodigal wealth of the fine lords
who did nothing but consume, James Steuart clearly developed this original
purpose of the tax on consumption in his <i>Recherches des principes de
l’economie politique</i>, which he published 10 years before Adam Smith.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Under the pure monarchy, the prince seems jealous, as it were, of
growing wealth, and therefore imposes taxes upon people who are growing
richer. Under the limited government they are calculated chiefly to affect
those who from rich are growing poorer. Thus the monarch imposes a tax
upon industry, where everyone is rated in proportion to the gain he is
supposed to make by his profession. The poll-tax and <i>taille</i> are
likewise proportioned to the supposed opulence of everyone libel to them....
In limited governments, impositions are more generally laid upon consumption.” </p>
<p class="inline">[II 190-91]</p>
<p>
As for the <i>logical sequence</i> of taxes, of the balance of trade, of
credit – in the understanding of M. Proudhon – we could only remark that
the English bourgeoisie, on attaining its political constitution under
William of Orange, created all at once a new system of taxes, public credit,
and the system of protective duties, as soon as it was in a position freely
to develop its conditions of existence.</p>
<p>This brief summary will suffice to give the reader a true idea
of M. Proudhon’s lubrications on the police or on taxes, the balance of
trade, credit, communism, and population. We defy the most indulgent criticism
to treat these chapters seriously.</p>

Strikes and Combinations of Workers
</h3>
<p class="skip"> </p>
<p class="quoteb">“Every upward movement in wages can have no other effect than a rise
in the price of corn, wine, etc., that is, the effect of a dearth. For
what are wages? They are the cost price of corn, etc.; they are the integrant
price of everything. We may go even further: wages are the proportion
of the elements composing wealth and consumed reproductively every day
by the mass of the workers. Now, to double wages ... is to attribute to
each one of the producers a greater share than his product, which is contradictory,
and if the rise extends only to a small number of industries, it brings
a general disturbance in exchange; in a word, a dearth....</p>
<p class="quoteb">“It is impossible, I declare, for strikes followed by an increase
in wages not to culminate in a general rise in prices: this is as certain
as that two and two make four.” </p>
<p class="inline">(Proudhon, Vol. I, pp. 110 and 111)</p>
<p>
We deny all these assertions, except that two and
two make four.</p>
<p>In the first place, there is no <i>general rise in prices</i>.
If the price of everything doubles at the same time as wages, there is
no change in price, the only change is in terms.</p>
<p>Then again, a general rise in wages can never produce a more or
less general rise in the price of goods. Actually, if every industry employed
the same number of workers in relation to fixed capital or to the instruments
used, a general rise in wages would produce a general fall in profits and
the current price of goods would undergo no alteration.</p>
<p>But as the relation of manual labour to fixed capital is not the
same in different industries, all the industries which employ a relatively
greater mass of capital and fewer workers, will be forced sooner or later
to lower the price of their goods. In the opposite case, in which the price
of their goods is not lowered, their profit will rise above the common
rate of profits. Machines are not wage-earners. Therefore, the general
rise in wages will affect less those industries, which, compared with the
others, employ more machines than workers. But as competition always tends
to level the rate of profits, those profits which rise above the average
rate cannot but be transitory. Thus, apart from a few fluctuations, a general
rise in wages will lead, not as M. Proudhon says, to a general increase
in prices, but to a partial fall – that is a fall in the current price
of the goods that are made chiefly with the help of machines.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of profits and wages expresses merely the proportion
in which capitalists and workers share in the product of a day's work,
without influencing in most instances the price of the product. But that
 “strikes followed by an increase in wages culminate in a general rise in
prices, in a dearth even” – those are notions which can blossom only in
the brain of a poet who has not been understood.</p>
<p>In England, strikes have regularly given rise to the invention
and application of new machines. Machines were, it may be said, the weapon
employed by the capitalist to quell the revolt of specialized labour. The
<i>self-acting mule</i>, the greatest invention of modern industry, put
out of action the spinners who were in revolt. If combinations and strikes
had no other effect than that of making the efforts of mechanical genius
react against them, they would still exercise an immense influence on the
development of industry.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“I find,” continues M. Proudhon, “in an article published by M. Leon
Faucher... September 1845, that for some time the British workers have
got out the habit of combination, which is assuredly a progress for which
one cannot but congratulate them: but this improvement in the morale
of the workers comes chiefly from their economic education. ‘It is not
on the manufacturers,’ cries a spinning-mill worker at a Bolton meeting,
 ‘that wages depend. In periods of depression the masters are, so to speak,
merely the whip with which necessity arms itself, and whether they want
to or not, they have to deal blows. The regulative principle is the relation
of supply and demand; and the masters have not this power’ ....</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “Well done!” cries M. Proudhon. “These are well-trained workers,
model workers, etc., etc., etc. Such poverty did not exist in Britain;
it will not cross the Channel.”</p>
<p class="inline">(Proudhon, Vol. I, pp. 261 and 262)</p>
<p>
Of all the towns in England, Bolton is the one in which the radicalism
is the most developed. The Bolton workers are known to be the most revolutionary
of all. At the time of the great agitation in England for the abolition
of the Corn Laws, the English manufacturers thought that they could cope
with the landowners only by thrusting the workers to the fore. But as the
interests of the workers were no less opposed to those of the manufacturers
than the interests of the manufacturers were to those of the landowners,
it was natural that the manufacturers should fare badly in the workers'
meetings. What did the manufacturers do? To save appearances they organized
meetings composed, to a large extent, of foremen, of the small number of
workers who were devoted to them, and of the real <i>friends of trade</i>.
When later on the genuine workers tried, as in Bolton and Manchester, to
take part in these sham demonstrations, in order to protest against them,
they were forbidden admittance on the ground that it was a <i>ticket meeting</i>
– a meeting to which only persons with entrance cards were admitted. Yet
the posters placarded on the walls had announced public meetings. Every
time one of these meetings was held, the manufacturers' newspapers gave
a pompous and detailed account of the speeches made. It goes without saying
that it was the foremen who made these speeches. The London papers reproduced
them word for word. M. Proudhon has the misfortune to take foremen for
ordinary workers, and enjoins them not to cross the Channel.</p>
<p>If in 1844 and 1845 strikes drew less attention than before, it
was because 1844 and 1845 were the first two years of prosperity that British
industry had had since 1837. Nevertheless none of the <i>trades unions</i>
had been dissolved.</p>
<p>Now let us listen to the foremen of Bolton. According to them
manufacturers have no command over wages because they have no command over
the price of products, and they have no command over the price of products
because they have no command over the world market. For this reason, they
wish it to be understood that combinations should not be formed to extort
an increase in wages from the masters. M. Proudhon, on the contrary, forbids
combinations for fear they should be followed by a rise in wages which
would bring with it a general dearth. We have no need to say that on one
point there is an <i>entente cordiale</i> between the foremen and M. Proudhon:
that a rise in wages is equivalent to a rise in the price of products.</p>
<p>But is the fear of a dearth the true cause of M. Proudhon's rancour?
No. Quite simple, he is annoyed with the Bolton foremen because they determine
value by <i>supply and demand</i> and hardly take any account of <i>constituted
value</i>, of value which has passed into the state of constitution, of
the constitution of value, including permanent exchangeability and all
the other proportionalities of relations and relations of proportionality,
with Providence at their side.</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “A workers' strike is illegal, and it is not only the Penal Code that
says so, it is the economic system, the necessity of the established order....</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “That each worker individually should dispose freely over his
person and his hands, this can be tolerated, but that workers should undertake
by combination to do violence to monopoly, is something society cannot
permit.” </p>
<p class="inline">(Vol. I, pp. 334 and 335)</p>
<p>
M. Proudhon wants to pass off an article of the Penal Code as a necessary
and general result of bourgeois relations of production.</p>
<p>In England, combination is authorized by an Act of Parliament,
and it is the economic system which has forced Parliament to grant this
legal authorization. In 1825, when, under the Minister Huskisson, Parliament
had to modify the law in order to bring it more and more into line with
the conditions resulting from free competition, it had of necessity to
abolish all laws forbidding combinations of workers. The more modern industry
and competition develop, the more elements there are which call forth and
strengthen combination, and as soon as combination becomes an economic fact,
daily gaining in solidity, it is bound before long to become a legal fact.</p>
<p>Thus the article of the Penal Code proves at the most that modern
industry and competition were not yet well developed under the Constituent
Assembly and under the Empire. <span class="note"><a href="#1" id="1b">[1]</a></span></p>
<p>Economists and socialists <span class="note"><a href="#2" id="2b">[*1]</a></span> are
in agreement on one point: the condemnation of <i>combination</i>. Only
they have different motives for their act of condemnation.</p>
<p>The economists say to workers:</p>
<p class="quoteb">Do not combine. By combination you hinder the regular progress
of industry, you prevent manufacturers from carrying out their orders,
you disturb trade and you precipitate the invasion of machines which, by
rendering your labour in part useless, force you to accept a still lower
wage. Besides, whatever you do, your wages will always be determined by
the relation of hands demanded to hands supplied, and it is an effort as
ridiculous as it is dangerous for you to revolt against the eternal laws
of political economy.</p>
<p>The socialists say to the workers:</p>
<p class="quoteb">Do not combine, because what will you gain by it anyway? A rise
in wages? The economists will prove to you quite clearly that the few ha'pence
you may gain by it for a few moments if you succeed will be followed by
a permanent fall. Skilled calculators will prove to you that it would take
you years merely to recover, through the increase in your wages, the expenses
incurred for the organization and upkeep of the combinations.</p>
<p>And we, as socialists, tell you that, apart from the money question,
you will continue nonetheless to be workers, and the masters will still
continue to be the masters, just as before. So no combination! No politics!
For is not entering into combination engaging in politics?</p>
<p>The economists want the workers to remain in society as it is
constituted and as it has been signed and sealed by them in their manuals.</p>
<p>The socialists want the workers to leave the old society alone,
the better to be able to enter the new society which they have prepared
for them with so much foresight.</p>
<p>In spite of both of them, in spite of manuals and utopias, combination
has not yet ceased for an instant to go forward and grow with the development
and growth of modern industry. It has now reached such a stage, that the
degree to which combination has developed in any country clearly marks
the rank it occupies in the hierarchy of the world market. England, whose
industry has attained the highest degree of development, has the biggest
and best organized combinations.</p>
<p>In England, they have not stopped at partial combinations which
have no other objective than a passing strike, and which disappear with
it. Permanent combinations have been formed, <i>trades unions</i>, which
serve as ramparts for the workers in their struggles with the employers.
And at the present time all these local <i>trades unions</i> find a rallying point
in the <a href="../../../../../glossary/orgs/n/a.html#naut" target=_blank><i>National Association of United Trades</i></a>, the central committee of
which is in London, and which already numbers 80,000 members. The organization of these strikes, combinations, and <i>trades unions</i> went on simultaneously with the political
struggles of the workers, who now constitute a large political party, under
the name of <i>Chartists</i>.</p>
<p>The first attempt of workers to associate among themselves always
takes place in the form of combinations.</p>
<p>Large-scale industry concentrates in one place a crowd of people
unknown to one another. Competition divides their interests. But the maintenance
of wages, this common interest which they have against their boss, unites
them in a common thought of resistance – <i>combination</i>. Thus combination
always has a double aim, that of stopping competition among the workers,
so that they can carry on general competition with the capitalist. If the
first aim of resistance was merely the maintenance of wages, combinations,
at first isolated, constitute themselves into groups as the capitalists
in their turn unite for the purpose of repression, and in the face of always
united capital, the maintenance of the association becomes more necessary
to them than that of wages. This is so true that English economists are
amazed to see the workers sacrifice a good part of their wages in favor
of associations, which, in the eyes of these economists, are established
solely in favor of wages. In this struggle – a veritable civil war –
all the elements necessary for a coming battle unite and develop. Once
it has reached this point, association takes on a political character.</p>
<p>Economic conditions had first transformed the mass of the people
of the country into workers. The combination of capital has created for
this mass a common situation, common interests. This mass is thus already
a class as against capital, but not yet for itself. In the struggle, of
which we have noted only a few phases, this mass becomes united, and constitutes
itself as a class for itself. The interests it defends become class interests.
But the struggle of class against class is a political struggle.</p>
<p>In the bourgeoisie we have two phases to distinguish: that in
which it constituted itself as a class under the regime of feudalism and
absolute monarchy, and that in which, already constituted as a class, it
overthrew feudalism and monarchy to make society into a bourgeois society.
The first of these phases was the longer and necessitated the greater efforts.
This too began by partial combinations against the feudal lords.</p>
<p>Much research has been carried out to trace the different historical
phases that the bourgeoisie has passed through, from the commune up to
its constitution as a class.</p>
<p>But when it is a question of making a precise study of strikes,
combinations and other forms in which the proletarians carry out before
our eyes their organization as a class, some are seized with real fear
and others display a <i>transcendental</i> disdain.</p>
<p>An oppressed class is the vital condition for every society founded
on the antagonism of classes. The emancipation of the oppressed class thus
implies necessarily the creation of a new society. For the oppressed class
to be able to emancipate itself, it is necessary that the productive powers
already acquired and the existing social relations should no longer be
capable of existing side by side. Of all the instruments of production,
the greatest productive power is the revolutionary class itself. The organization
of revolutionary elements as a class supposes the existence of all the
productive forces which could be engendered in the bosom of the old society.</p>
<p>Does this mean that after the fall of the old society there will
be a new class domination culminating in a new political power? No.</p>
<p>The condition for the emancipation of the working class is the
abolition of every class, just as the condition for the liberation of the
third estate, of the bourgeois order, was the abolition of all estates
and all orders. <span class="note"><a href="#3" id="3b">[*2]</a></span>
</p>
<p>The working class, in the course of its development, will substitute
for the old civil society an association which will exclude classes and
their antagonism, and there will be no more political power properly so-called,
since political power is precisely the official expression of antagonism
in civil society.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the antagonism between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie
is a struggle of class against class, a struggle which carried to its highest
expression is a total revolution. Indeed, is it at all surprising that
a society founded on the <i>opposition</i> of classes should culminate in brutal
<i>contradiction</i>, the shock of body against body, as its final denouement?</p>
<p>Do not say that social movement excludes political movement. There
is never a political movement which is not at the same time social.</p>
<p>It is only in an order of things in which there are no more classes
and class antagonisms that <i>social evolutions</i> will cease to be <i>political
revolutions</i>. Till then, on the eve of every general reshuffling of
society, the last word of social science will always be:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “Le combat ou la mort; la lutte sanguinaire ou le neant. C’est ainsi
que la quéstion est invinciblement posée.” </p>
<p class="inline">[From the novel <i>Jean Siska</i> by George Sand:<br>
 “Combat or Death: bloody struggle or extinction. It is thus that the question is inexorably put.”]</p>

The laws in operation at that time
in France – the so-called Le Chapelier law adopted in 1791 during the
revolution by the Constituent Assembly and the criminal code
elaborated under the Napoleonic Empire – forbade the workers to form labour
unions or to go on strike. The prohibition of trade unions was abolished in France in 1884.

Estates here in the historical sense of the estates of
feudalism, estates with definite and limited privileges. The revolution
of the bourgeoisie abolished the estates and their privileges. Bourgeois
society knows only <i>classes</i>. It was, therefore, absolutely in contradiction
with history to describe the proletariat as the “fourth estate.” [– Engels,
1885 German edition.]

4. Property or Ground Rent
</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>
In each historical epoch, property has developed
differently and under a set of entirely different social relations. Thus
to define bourgeois property is nothing else than to give an exposition
of all the social relations of bourgeois production.

<p>To try to give a definition of property as of an independent relation,
a category apart, an abstract and eternal idea, can be nothing but an illusion
of metaphysics or jurisprudence.

<p>M. Proudhon, while seeming to speak of property in general, deals
only with <i>landed property</i>, with <i>ground rent</i>.

<p class="quoteb"> “The origin of rent, as property, is, so to speak, extra- economic:
it rests in psychological and moral considerations which are only very
distantly connected with the production of wealth.” 

</p>
<p class="inline">(Vol. II, p. 265)

</p>
<p>
So M. Proudhon declares himself incapable of understanding the economic
origin of rent and of property. He admits that this incapacity obliges
him to resort to psychological and moral considerations, which, indeed,
while only distantly connected with the production of wealth, have yet
a very close connection with the narrowness of his historical views. M.
Proudhon affirms that there is something <i>mystical</i> and <i>mysterious</i>
about the origin of property. Now, to see mystery in the origin of property
– that is, to make a mystery of the relation between production itself
and the distribution of the instruments of production – is not this, to
use M. Proudhon’s language, a renunciation of all claims to economic science? 


<p class="quoteb"> M. Proudhon “confines himself to recalling that at the seventh epoch
of economic evolution – credit – when fiction had caused reality to vanish,
and human activity threatened to lose itself in empty space, it had become
necessary to bind man more closely to nature. Now, rent was the price of
this new contract.” 

</p>
<p class="inline">(Vol. II, p. 269)

</p>
<p>
<i>L’homme aux quarante écus</i> <span class="note"><a href="#1" id="1b">[1]</a></span> foresaw a M.
Proudhon of the future:


<p class="quoteb"> “Mr. Creator, by your leave: everyone is master in his own world: but
you will never make me believe that the one we live in is made of glass.” 

</p>
<p>
In your world, where credit was a means of losing oneself in empty space,
it is very possible that property became necessary in order to bind man
to nature. In the world of real production, where landed property always
precedes credit, M. Proudhon’s <i>horror vacui</i> <span class="context">[horror of a vacuum]</span> could not exist.

<p>The existence of rent once admitted, whatever its origin, it becomes
a subject of mutually antagonistic negotiations between the farmer and
the landed proprietor. What is the ultimate result of these negotiations,
in other words, what is the average amount of rent? This is what M. Proudhon
says:


<p class="quoteb"> “Ricardo’s theory answers this question. In the beginning of society,
when man, new to earth, had before him nothing but huge forests, when the
earth was vast and when industry was beginning to come to life, rent must
have been nil. Land, as yet unformed by labour, was an object of utility;
it was not an exchange value, it was common, not social. Little by little,
the multiplication of families and the progress of agriculture caused the
price of land to make itself felt. Labour came to give the soil its worth;
from this, rent came into being. The more fruit a field yielded with the
same amount of labour, the higher it was valued; hence the tendency of proprietors
was always to arrogate to themselves the whole amount of the fruits of
the soil, less the wages of the farm – that is, less the costs of production. 
Thus property followed on the heels of labour to take from it all
the product that exceeded the actual expenses. As the proprietor fulfils
a mystic duty and represents the community as against the <i>colonus</i>,
that farmer is, by the dispensation of Providence, no more than a responsible
labourer, who must account to society for all he reaps above his legitimate
wage. ...

<p class="quoteb"> “In essence and by destination, then, rent is an instrument of
distributive justice, one of the thousand means that the genius of economy
employs to attain to equality. It is an immediate land valuation which
is carried out contradictorily by landowners and farmers, without any
possible collusion, in a higher interest, and whose ultimate result must
be to equalize the possession of the land between the exploiters of the
soil and the industrialists....

<p class="quoteb"> “It needed no less than this magic of property to snatch from
the <i>colonus</i> the surplus of his product which he cannot help regarding
as his own and of which he considers himself to be exclusively the author.
Rent, or rather property, has broken down agricultural egoism and created
a solidarity that no power, no partition of the land could have brought
into being....

<p class="quoteb"> “The moral effect of property having been secured, at present
what remains to be done is to distribute the rent.” 

</p>
<p class="inline">[Vol. II, pp. 270-272]

</p>
<p>
All this tumult of words may be reduced firstly to this: Ricardo says that
the excess of the price of agricultural products over their cost of production,
including the ordinary profit and interest on the capital, gives the measure
of the rent. M. Proudhon does better. He makes the landowner intervene,
like a <i>Deus ex machina</i>, and snatch from the <i>colonus</i> all the
surplus of his production over the cost of production. He makes use of
the intervention of the landowner to explain property,
of the intervention of the rent-receiver to explain rent.
He answers the problem by formulating the same problem and adding an extra
syllable. <span class="note"><a href="#2" id="2b">[2]</a></span>
<p>Let us note also that in determining rent by the difference in
fertility of the soil, M. Proudhon assigns a new origin to it, since land,
before being assessed according to different degrees of fertility, “was
not,” in his view, “an exchange value, but was common.” What, then, has
happened to the fiction about rent having come into being through the necessity
of bringing back to the land man who was about to lose himself in the infinity
of empty space?

<p>Now let us free Ricardo’s doctrine from the providential, allegorical,
and mystical phrases in which M. Proudhon has been careful to wrap it.

<p>Rent, in the Ricardian sense, is property in land in its bourgeois
state; that is, feudal property which has become subject to the conditions
of bourgeois production.

<p>We have seen that, according to the Ricardian doctrine, the price
of all objects is determined ultimately by the cost of production, including
the industrial profit; in other words, by the labour time employed. In manufacturing
industry, the price of the product obtained by the minimum of labour regulates
the price of all other commodities of the same kind, seeing that the cheapest
and most productive instruments of production can be multiplied to infinity
and that competition necessarily gives rise to a market price – that is,
a common price for all products of the same kind.

<p>In agricultural industry, on the contrary, it is the price of
the product obtained by the greatest amount of labour which regulates the
price of all products of the same kind. In the first place, one cannot,
as in manufacturing industry, multiply at will the instruments of production
possessing the same degree of productivity, that is, plots of land with
the same degree of fertility. Then, as population increases, land of an
inferior quality begins to be exploited, or new outlays of capital, proportionately
less productive than before, are made upon the same plot of land. In both
cases a greater amount of labour is expended to obtain a proportionately
smaller product. The needs of the population having rendered necessary
this increase of labour, the product of the land whose exploitation is the
more costly has as certain a sale as that of a piece of land whose exploitation
is cheaper. As competition levels the market price, the product of the
better soil will be paid for as dearly as that of the inferior. It is the
excess of the price of the products of the better soil over the cost of
their production that constitutes rent. If one could always have at one’s
disposal plots of land of the same degree of fertility; if one could, as
in manufacturing industry, have recourse continually to cheaper and more
productive machines, or if the subsequent outlays of capital produced as
much as the first, then the price of agricultural products would be determined
by the price of commodities produced by the best instruments of production,
as we have seen with the price of manufactured products. But, from this
moment rent would have disappeared also.

<p>For the Ricardian doctrine – “once the premises granted” – to be generally true,
it is moreover essential that capital should be freely applicable to different
branches of industry; that a strongly developed competition among the capitalists
should have brought profits to an equal level; that the farmer should be
no more than an industrial capitalist claiming for the use of his capital
on the land, a profit equal to that which he would draw from his capital
if it were applied in any kind of manufacture; that agricultural exploitation
should be subjected to the regime of large-scale industry; and finally,
that the landowner himself should aim at nothing beyond the money return. 

<p>It may happen, as in Ireland, that rent does not yet exist, although
the letting of land has reached an extreme development there. Rent being
the excess not only over wages, but also over industrial profit, it cannot
exist where the landowner’s revenue is nothing but a mere levy on wages.

<p>Thus, far from converting the exploiter of the land, the farmer,
into a <i>simple labourer</i>, and “snatching from the cultivator the surplus
of his product, which he cannot help regarding as his own,” rent confronts
the landowner, not with the slave, the serf, the payer of tribute, the
wage labourer, but with the industrial capitalist.

<p>Once constituted as ground rent, ground property has in its possession
only the surplus over production costs, which are determined not only by
wages but also by industrial profit. It is therefore from the landowner
that ground rent snatched a part of his income. Thus, there was a big lapse
of time before the feudal farmer was replaced by the industrial capitalist.
In Germany, for example, this transformation began only in the last third
of the 18th century. It is in England alone that this relation between
the industrial capitalist and the landed proprietor has been fully developed.

<p>So long as there was only M. Proudhon’s <i>colonus</i>, there
was no rent. The moment rent exists, the <i>colonus</i> is no longer
the farmer, but the worker, the farmer’s <i>colonus</i>. The abasement
of the labourer, reduced to the role of a simple worker, day labourer, wage-earner,
working for the industrial capitalist; the invention of the industrial
capitalist, exploiting the land like any other factory; the transformation
of the landed proprietor from a petty sovereign into a vulgar usurer; these
are the different relations expressed by rent.

<p>Rent, in the Ricardian sense, is patriarchal agriculture transformed
into commercial industry, industrial capital applied to land, the town
bourgeoisie transplanted into the country. Rent, instead of <i>binding
man to nature</i>, has merely bound the exploitation of the land to competition.
Once established as rent, landed property itself is the <i>result of competition</i>,
since from that time onwards it depends on the market value of agricultural
produce. As rent, landed property is mobilized and becomes an article of
commerce. Rent is possible only from the moment when the development of
urban industry, and the social organization resulting therefrom, force
the landowner to aim solely at cash profits, at the monetary relation of
his agricultural products – in fact to look upon his landed property only
as a machine for coining money. Rent has so completely divorced the landed
proprietor from the soil, from nature, that he has no need even to know
his estates, as is to be seen in England. As for the farmer, the industrial
capitalist and the agricultural worker, they are no more bound to the land
they exploit than are the employer and the worker in the factories to the
cotton and wool they manufacture; they feel an attachment only for the
price of their production, the monetary product. Hence the jeremiads of
the reactionary parties, who offer up all their prayers for the return
of feudalism, of the good old patriarchal life, of the simple manners and
the fine virtues of our forefathers. The subjection of the soil to the
laws which dominate all other industries is and always will be the subject
of interested condolences. Thus it may be said that rent has become the
motive power which has introduced idyll into the movement of history.

<p>Ricardo, after postulating bourgeois production as necessary for
determining rent, applies the conception of rent, nevertheless, to the
landed property of all ages and all countries. This is an error common
to all the economists, who represent the bourgeois relations of production
as eternal categories.

<p>From the providential aim of rent – which is, for M. Proudhon,
the transformation of the <i>colonus</i> into a <i>responsible worker</i>,
he passes to the equalized reward of rent.

<p>Rent, as we have just seen, is constituted by the <i>equal price</i>
of the products of lands of <i>unequal fertility</i>, so that a hectolitre
of corn which has cost 10 francs is sold for 20 francs if the cost of production
rises to 20 francs upon soil of inferior quality.

<p>So long as necessity forces the purchase of all the agricultural
products into the market, the market price is determined by the cost of
the most expensive product. Thus it is this equalization of price, resulting
from competition and not from the different fertilities of the lands, that
secures to the owner of the better soil a rent of 10 francs for every
hectolitre that his tenant sells.

<p>Let us suppose for a moment that the price of corn is determined
by the labour time needed to produce it, and at once the hectolitre of corn
obtained from the better soil will sell at 10 francs, while the hectolitre
of corn obtained on the inferior soil will cost 20 francs. This being admitted,
the average market price will be 15 francs, whereas, according to the law
of competition, it is 20 francs. If the average price were 15 francs, there
would be no occasion for any distribution, whether equalized or otherwise,
for there would be no rent. Rent exists only when one can sell for 20 francs
the hectolitre of corn which has cost the producer 10 francs. M. Proudhon
supposes equality of the market price, with unequal costs of production,
in order to arrive at an equalized sharing out of the product of inequality.

<p>We understand such economists as Mill, Cherbuliez, Hilditch, and
others demanding that rent should be handed over to the state to serve
in place of taxes. That is a frank expression of the hatred the industrial
capitalist bears towards the landed proprietor, who seems to him a useless
thing, an excrescence upon the general body of bourgeois production.

<p>But first to make the price of the hectolitre of corn 20 francs
in order then to make a general distribution of the 10 francs overcharge
levied on the consumer, is indeed enough to make the <i>social genius</i>
pursue <i>its zigzag course mournfully</i> – and knock its head against
some <i>corner</i>.


<p class="quoteb"> Rent becomes, under M. Proudhon’s pen, “an immense land valuation,
which is carried out contradictorily by land-owners and farmers... in
a higher interest, and whose ultimate result must be to equalize the possession
of land between exploiters of the soil and the industrialists.” 

</p>
<p class="inline">[Vol. II, p. 271]

</p>
<p>
For any land valuation based upon rent to be of practical value, the conditions
of present society must not be departed from.

<p>Now, we have shown that the farm rent paid by the farmer to the
landlord expresses the rent with any exactitude only in the countries most
advanced in industry and commerce. And even this rent often includes interest
paid to the landlord on capital incorporated in the land. The location
of the land, the vicinity of towns, and many other circumstances influence
the farm rent and modify the ground rent. These peremptory reasons would
be enough to prove the inaccuracy of a land valuation based on rent.

<p>Thus history, far from supplying, in rent, a ready-made land valuation,
does nothing but change and turn topsy-turvy the land valuations already
made.

<p>Finally, fertility is not so natural a quality as might be thought;
it is closely bound up with the social relations of the time. A piece of
land may be very fertile for corn growing, and yet the market price may
decide the cultivator to turn it into an artificial pastureland and thus
render it infertile.

<p>M. Proudhon has improvised his land valuation, which has not even
the value of an ordinary land valuation, only to give substance to the
<i>providentially equalitarian aim</i> of rent.

<p>
<p class="quoteb"> “Rent,” continues M. Proudhon, “is the interest paid on a capital which
never perishes, namely – land. And as the capital is capable of no increase
in matter, but only of an indefinite improvement in its use, it comes about
that while the interest or profit on a loan (<i>mutuum</i>) tends to diminish
continually through abundance of capital, rent tends always to increase
through the perfecting of industry, from which results the improvement
in the use of the land.... Such, in its essence, is rent.” 

</p>
<p class="inline">(Vol. II, p. 265)

</p>
<p>
This time, M. Proudhon sees in rent all the characteristics of interest,
save that it is derived from capital of a specific nature. This capital
is land, an eternal capital, “which is capable of no increase in matter,
but only an indefinite improvement in its use.” In the progressive advance
of civilization, interest has a continual tendency to fall, whilst rent
continually tends to rise. Interest falls because of the abundance of capital;
rent rises owning to the improvements brought about in industry, which
results in an ever better utilization of land.

<p>Such, in its essence, is the opinion of M. Proudhon.

<p>Let us first examine how far it is true to say that rent is interest
on capital.

<p>For the landed proprietor himself, rent represents the interest
on the capital that the land has cost him, or that he would draw from it
if he sold it. But in buying or selling land he only buys or sells rent.
The price he pays to make himself a receiver of rent is regulated by the
rate of interest in general and has nothing to do with actual nature
of rent. The interest on capital invested in land is in general lower 
than the interest on capital invested in manufacture or commerce. Thus,
for those who make no distinction between the interest that the land represents
to the owner and the rent itself, the interest on land capital diminishes
still more than does the interest on other capital. But it is not a question
of the purchase or sale price of rent, of the marketable value of rent,
of capitalized rent, it is a question of rent itself.

<p>Farm rent can imply again, apart from rent proper, the interest
on the capital incorporated in the land. In this instance the landlord
receives this part of the farm rent, not as a landlord but as a capitalist;
but this is not the rent proper that we are to deal with.

<p>Land, so long as it is not exploited as a means of production,
is not capital. Land as capital can be increased just as much as all the
other instruments of production. Nothing is added to its matter, to use
M. Proudhon’s language, but the lands which serve as instruments of production
are multiplied. The very fact of applying further outlays of capital to
land already transformed into means of production increases land as capital
without adding anything to land as matter – that is, to the extent of
the land. M. Proudhon’s land as matter is the Earth in its limitation.
As for the eternity he attributes to land, we grant readily it has this
virtue as matter. Land as capital is no more eternal than any other capital.

<p>Gold and silver, which yield interest, are just as lasting and
eternal as land. If the price of gold and silver falls, while that of land
keeps rising, this is certainly not because of its more or less eternal
nature.

<p>Land as capital is fixed capital; but fixed capital gets used
up just as much as circulating capital. Improvements to the land need production
and upkeep; they last only for a time; and this they have in common with
all other improvements used to transform matter into means of production.
If land as capital were eternal, some lands would present a very different
appearance from what they do today, and we should see the Roman Campagna,
Sicily, Palestine, in all the splendour of their former prosperity.

<p>There are even instances when land as capital might disappear,
even though the improvements remain incorporated in the land.

<p>In the first place, this occurs every time rent proper is wiped
out by the competition of new and more fertile soils; secondly, the improvements
which might have been valuable at one time cease to be of value the moment
they become universal owing to the development of agronomy.

<p>The representative of land as capital is not the landlord, but
the farmer. The proceeds yielded by land as capital are interest and industrial
profit, not rent. There are lands which yield such interest and profit
but still yield no rent.

<p>Briefly, land in so far as it yields interest, is land capital,
and as land capital it yields no rent, it is not landed property. Rent
results from the social relations in which the exploitation of the land
takes place. It cannot be a result of the more or less solid, more or less
durable nature of the soil. Rent is a product of society and not of the
soil.

<p>According to M. Proudhon, “improvement in the use of the land” 
– a consequence “of the perfecting of industry” – causes the continual
rise in rent. On the contrary, this improvement causes its periodic fall.

<p>Wherein consists, in general, any improvement, whether in agriculture
or in manufacture? In producing more with the same labour; in producing
as much, or even more, with less labour. Thanks to these improvements, the
farmer is spared from using a greater amount of labour for a relatively
smaller product. He has no need, therefore, to resort to inferior soils,
and instalments of capital applied successively to the same soil remain
equally productive.

<p>Thus, these improvements, far from continually raising rent as
M. Proudhon says, become on the contrary so many temporary obstacles preventing
its rise.

<p>The English landowners of the 17th century were so well aware
of this truth, that they opposed the progress of agriculture for fear of
seeing their incomes diminish. (See Petty, an English economist of the
time of Charles II.)

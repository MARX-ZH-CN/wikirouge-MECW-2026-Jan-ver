<h3>2. Constituted Value or Synthetic Value</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>
Value (marketable value) is the corner-stone
of the economic structure. “Constituted” value is the corner-stone of
the system of economic contradictions.

<p>What then is this “constituted value” which is all M. Proudhon
has discovered in political economy?

<p>Once utility is admitted, labor is the source of all value. The
measure of labor is time. The relative value of products is determined
by the labor time required for their production. Price is the monetary
expression of the relative value of a product. Finally, the the constituted
value of a product is purely and simply the value which is constituted
by the labor time incorporated in it.

<p>Just as Adam Smith discovered the division of labor, so he, M.
Proudhon, claims to have discovered “constituted value.” This is not exactly
 “something unheard of,” but then it must be admitted that there is nothing
unheard of in any discovery of economic science. M. Proudhon, who fully appreciates
the importance of his own invention, seeks nevertheless to
tone down the merit therefore “in order to reassure the reader to as his
claims to originality, and to win over minds whose timidity renders them
little favorable to new ideas.” But in apportioning the contribution made
by each of his predecessors to the understanding of value, he is forced
to confess openly that the largest portion, the lion’s share, of the merit
falls to himself.

<p class="quoteb">
 “The synthetic idea of value had been vaguely perceived by Adam Smith....
But with Adam Smith the idea of value was entirely intuitive. Now, society
does not change its habits merely on the strength of intuitions: its decisions
are made only on the authority of facts. The antinomy had to be stated
more palpably and more clearly: J.B. Say was its chief interpreter." 
</p>
<p class="inline">[I 66]</p>
<p>
Here, in a nutshell, is the history of the discovery of synthetic value:
Adam Smith – vague intuition; J. B. Say – antinomy; M. Proudhon – constituting
and “constituted” truth. And let there be no mistake about it: all the
other economists, from Say to Proudhon, have merely been trudging along
in the rut of antimony.

<p class="quoteb">  “It is incredible that for the last 40 years so many men of sense should
have fumed and fretted at such a simple idea. But no, values are compared
without there being any point of comparison between them and with no unit
of measurements; this, rather than embrace the revolutionary theory of
equality, is what the economists of the 19th century are resolved to uphold
against all comers. What will posterity say about it?" 

</p>
<p class="inline">(Vol.I, p.68)</p>
<p>
Posterity, so abruptly invoked, will begin by getting muddled over the
chronology. It is bound to ask itself: are not Ricardo and his school economists
of the 19th century? Ricardo’s system, putting as a principle that “the
relative value of commodities corresponds exclusively to their production",
dates from 1817. Ricardo is the head of a whole school dominant in England
since the Restoration. <span class="inote">[The Restoration began after the termination
of the Napoleonic wars and the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty in France
in 1815.]</span> The Ricardian doctrine summarizes severely, remorselessly, the
whole of the English bourgeoisie. “What will posterity say about it?” It
will not say that M. Proudhon did not know Ricardo, for he talks about
him, he talks at length about him, he keeps coming back to him, and concludes
by calling his system “trash". If ever posterity does interfere, it will
say perhaps that M. Proudhon, afraid of offending his readers’ Anglophobia,
preferred to make himself the responsible editor of Ricardo’s ideas. In
any case, it will think it very naive that M. Proudhon should give as a
"revolutionary theory of the future” what Ricardo expounded scientifically
as the theory of present-day society, of bourgeois society, and that he
should thus take for the solution of the antinomy between utility and exchange
value what Ricardo and his school presented long before him as the scientific
formula of one single side of this antinomy, that of exchange value. But
let us leave posterity alone once and for all, and confront M. Proudhon
with his predecessor Ricardo. Here are some extracts from this author which
summarize his doctrine on value:

<p class="quoteb"> “Utility then is not the measure of exchangeable value, although it
is absolutely essential to it." 

</p>
<p class="inline">(Vol.I, p.3, <i>Principles de l’economie</i>
<br><i>politique, etc.</i>, translated from the
<br>English by F.S. Constancio, Paris 1835)</p>
<p>
<p class="quoteb"> “Possessing utility, commodities derive their exchangeable value from
two sources: from their scarcity, and from the quantity of labor required
to obtain them. There are some commodities, the value of which is determined
by their scarcity alone. No labor can increase the quantity of such goods,
and therefore their value cannot be lowered by an increased supply. Some
rare statues and pictures, scarce books... are all of this description.
Their value... varies with the varying wealth and inclinations of those
who are desirous to possess them." 

</p>
<p class="inline">(Vol.I, pp.4 and 5, l. c.)</p>
<p>
<p class="quoteb"> “These commodities, however, form a very small part of the mass of
commodities daily exchanged in the market. By far the greatest part of
these goods which are the objects of desire, are procured by labor; and
they may be multiplied, not in one country alone, but in many, almost without
any assignable limit, if we are disposed to bestow the labor necessary
to obtain them.” 

</p>
<p class="inline">(Vol.I, pp.5, l. c.)</p>
<p>
<p class="quoteb"> “In speaking then of commodities, of their exchangeable value, and
of the laws which regulate their relative prices, we mean always such commodities
only as can be increased in quantity by the exertion of human industry,
and on the production of which competition operates without restraint.” 

</p>
<p class="inline">(Vol.I, pp.5)</p>
<p>
Ricardo quotes Adam Smith, who, according to him, “so accurately defined
the original source of exchangeable value” (Adam Smith, <i>Wealth of Nations</i>,
Book I, Chap 5 <span class="inote">[<i>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes
of the Wealth of Nations</i>, first edition appearing in London, 1776]</span>),
and he adds:

<p class="quoteb"> “That this (i.e., labor time) is really the foundation of the exchangeable
value of all things, excepting those which cannot be increased by human
industry, is a doctrine of the utmost importance in political economy;
for from no source do so many errors, and so much difference of opinion
in that science proceed, as from the vague ideas which are attached to
the word value.” 

</p>
<p class="inline">(Vol.I, p.8)</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “If the quantity of labor realized in commodities regulate their exchangeable
value, every increase of the quantity of labor must augment the value of
that commodity on which it is exercised, as every diminution must lower
it.” 

</p>
<p class="inline">(Vol.I, p.8)</p>
<p>
Ricardo goes on to reproach Smith:

<p class="quote-list">
1. With having “himself erected another standard measure of value” than labor.
 “Sometimes he speaks of corn, at other times of labor, as a standard measure;
not the quantity of labor bestowed on the production of any object, but
the quantity it can command in the market.” (Vol.I, pp.9 and 10)</p>
<p class="quote-list">
2. With having “admitted the principle without qualification and at the same
time restricted its application to that early and rude state of society,
which precedes both the accumulation of stock and the appropriation of
land.” (Vol.I, p.21)</p>
<p>
Ricardo sets out to prove that the ownership of land, that is, ground rent,
cannot change the relative value of commodities and that the accumulation
of capital has only a passing and fluctuation effect on the relative values
determined by the comparative quantity of labor expended on their production.
In support of this thesis, he gives his famous theory of ground rent, analyses
capital, and ultimately finds nothing in it but accumulated labor. Then
he develops a whole theory of wages and profits, and proves that wages
and profits rise and fall in inverse ratio to each other, without affecting
the relative value of the product. He does not neglect the influence that
the accumulation of capital and its different aspects (fixed capital and
circulating capital), as also the rate of wages, can have on the proportional
value of products. In fact, they are the chief problems with which Ricardo
is concerned.
</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “Economy in the use of labor never fails to reduce the relative value
<span class="note"><a href="#1" id="1b">[*1]</a></span> of a commodity, whether the saving be in the labor
necessary to the manufacture of the commodity itself, or in that necessary
to the formation of the capital, by the aid of which it is produced." 

</p>
<p class="inline">(Vol.I, p.28)</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “Under such circumstance the value of the deer, the produce of the
hunter’s day’s labor, would be exactly equal to the value of the fish,
the produce of the fisherman’s day’s labor. The comparative value of the
fish and the game would be entirely regulated by the quantity of labor
realized in each, whatever might be the quantity of production, or however
high or low general wages or profits might be.” 

</p>
<p class="inline">(Vol.I, p.28)</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “In making labor the foundation of the value of commodities and the
comparative quantity of labor which is necessary to their production, the
rule which determines the respective quantities of goods which shall be
given in exchange for each other, we must not be supposed to deny the accidental
and temporary deviations of the actual or market price of commodities from
this, their primary and natural price.” 

</p>
<p class="inline">(Vol.I, p.105, l. c.)

<p>
<p class="quoteb"> “It is the cost of production which must ultimately regulate the price
of commodities, and not, as has been often said, the proportion between
supply and demand.” 

</p>
<p class="inline">(Vol.II, p.253)</p>
<p>
Lord Lauderdale had developed the variations of exchange value according
to the law of supply and demand, or of scarcity and abundance relatively
to demand. In his opinion the value of a thing can increase when its quantity
decreases or when the demand for it increases; it can decrease owing to
an increase of its quantity or owing to the decrease in demand. Thus the
value of a thing can change through eight different causes, namely, four
causes that apply to money or to any other commodity which serves as a
measure of its value. Here is Ricardo’s refutation:

<p class="quoteb"> “Commodities which are monopolized, either by an individual, or by
a company, vary according to the law which Lord Laudersdale has laid down:
they fall in proportion as the sellers augment their quantity, and rise
in proportion to the eagerness of the buyers to purchase them; their price
has no necessary connexion with their natural value; but the prices of
commodities, which are subject to competition, and whose quantity may be
increased in any moderate degree, will ultimately depend, not on the state
of demand and supply, but on the increased or diminished cost of their
production.” 

</p>
<p class="inline">(Vol.II, p.259)</p>
<p>
We shall leave it to the reader to make the comparison between this simple,
clear, precise language of Ricardo’s and M. Proudhon’s rhetorical attempts
to arrive at the determination of relative value by labor time.

<p>Ricardo shows us the real movement of bourgeois production, which
constitutes value. M. Proudhon, leaving the real movement out of account,
 “fumes and frets” in order to invent new processes and to achieve the reorganization
of the world on a would-be new formula, which formula is no more than the
theoretical expression of the real movement which exists and which is so
well described by Ricardo. Ricardo takes his starting point from present-day
society to demonstrate to us how it constitutes value – M. Proudhon takes
constituted value as his starting point to construct a new social world
with the aid of this value. For him, M. Proudhon, constituted value must
move around and become once more the constituting factor in a world already
completely constituted according to this mode of evaluation. The determination
of value by labor time, is, for Ricardo, the law of exchange value; for
M. Proudhon. it is the synthesis of use value and exchange value. Ricardo’s
theory of values is the scientific interpretation of actual economic life;
M. Proudhon’s theory of values is the utopian interpretation of Ricardo’s
theory. Ricardo establishes the truth of his formula by deriving it from
all economic relations, and by explaining in this way all phenomena, even
those like ground rent, accumulation of capital and the relation of wages
to profits, which at first sight seems to contradict it; it is precisely
that which makes his doctrine a scientific system: M. Proudhon, who has
rediscovered this formula of Ricardo’s by means of quite arbitrary hypotheses,
is forced thereafter to seek out isolated economic facts which he twists
and falsifies to pass them off as examples, already existing applications,
beginning of realization of his regenerating idea. (See our <a href="ch01c.html" target=_blank>S.3. Application of Constituted Value</a>)

<p>Now let us pass on to the conclusions M. Proudhon draws from value
constituted (by labor time).

<p class="quotec">
- A certain quantity of labor is equivalent to the product created by this
same quantity of labor.</p>
<p class="quotec">
- Each day’s labor is worth as much as another day’s labor; that is to say,
if the quantities are equal, one man’s labor is worth as much as another
man’s labor: there is no qualitative difference. With the same quantity
of work, one man’s product can be given in exchange for another man’s product.
All men are wage workers getting equal pay for an equal time of work. Perfect
equality rules the exchanges.</p>
<p>
Are these conclusions the strict, natural consequences of value “constituted" 
or determined by labor time?

<p>If the relative value of a commodity is determined by the quantity
of labor required to produce it, it follows naturally that the relative
value of labor, or wages, is likewise determined by the quantity of labor
needed to produce the wages. Wages, that is, the relative value or the
price of labor, are thus determined by the labor time needed to produce
all that is necessary for the maintenance of the worker.

<p class="quoteb"> "Diminish the cost of production of hats, and their price will ultimately
fall to their own new natural price, although the demand should be doubled,
trebled, or quadrupled. Diminish the cost of subsistence of men, by diminishing
the natural price of food and clothing, by which life is sustained, and
wages will ultimately fall, notwithstanding the demand for laborers may
very greatly increase." 

</p>
<p class="inline">(Ricardo, Vol.II, p.253)</p>
<p>
Doubtless, Ricardo’s language is as cynical as can be. To put the cost
of manufacture of hats and the cost of maintenance of men on the same plane
is to turn men into hats. But do not make an outcry at the cynicism of
it. The cynicism is in the facts and not in the words which express the
facts. French writers like M.M. Droz, Blanqui, Rossi and others take an
innocent satisfaction in proving their superiority over the English economists,
by seeking to observe the etiquette of a “humanitarian” phraseology; if
they reproach Ricardo and his school for their cynical language, it is
because it annoys them to see economic relations exposed in all their crudity,
to see the mysteries of the bourgeoisie unmasked.

<p>To sum up: Labor, being itself a commodity, is measured as such
by the labor time needed to produce the labor-commodity. And what is needed
to produce this labor-commodity? Just enough labor time to produce the
objects indispensable to the constant maintenance of labor, that is, to
keep the worker alive and in a condition to propagate his race. The natural
price of labor is no other than the wage minimum. <span class="note"><a href="#2" id="2b">[*2]</a></span>
If the current rate of wages rises above this natural price, it is precisely
because the law of value put as a principle by M. Proudhon happens to be
counterbalanced by the consequences of the varying relations of supply
and demand. But the minimum wage is nonetheless the centre towards which
the current rates of wages gravitate.

<p>Thus relative value, measured by labor time, is inevitably the
formula of the present enslavement of the worker, instead of being, as
M. Proudhon would have it, the “revolutionary theory” of the emancipation
of the proletariat.

<p>Let us now see to what extent the application of labor time as
a measure of value is incompatible with the existing class antagonism and
the unequal distribution of the product between the immediate worker and
the owner of accumulated labor.

<p>Let us take a particular product: broadcloth, which has required
the same quantity of labor as the linen.

<p>If there is an exchange of these two products, there is an exchange
of equal quantities of labor. In exchanging these equal quantities of labor
time, one does not change the reciprocal position of the producers, any
more than one changes anything in the situation of the workers and manufacturers
among themselves. To say that this exchange of products measured by labor
time results in an equality of payment for all the producers is to suppose
that equality of participation in the product existed before the exchange.
When the exchange of broadcloth for linen has been accomplished, the producers
of broadcloth will share in the linen in a proportion equal to that in
which they previously shared in the broadcloth.

<p>M. Proudhon’s illusion is brought about by his taking for a consequence
what could be at most but a gratuitous supposition.

<p>Let us go further.

<p>Does labor time, as the measure of value, suppose at least that
the days are equivalent, and that one man’s day is worth as much as another’s?
No.

<p>Let us suppose for a moment that a jeweller’s day is equivalent
to three days of a weaver; the fact remains that any change in the value
of jewels relative to that of woven materials, unless it be the transitory
result of the fluctuations of supply and demand, must have as its cause
a reduction or an increase in the labor time expended in the production
of one or the other. If three working days of different workers be related
to one another in the ratio of 1:2:3, then every change in the relative
value of their products will be a change in this same proportion of 1:2:3.
Thus values can be measured by labor time, in spite of the inequality of
value of different working days; but to apply such a measure we must have
a comparative scale of the different working days: it is competition that
sets up this scale.

<p>Is your hour’s labor worth mine? That is a question which is decided
by competition.

<p>Competition, according to an American economist, determines how
many days of simple labor are contained in one day’s compound labor. Does
not this reduction of days of compound labor to days of simple labor suppose
that simple labor is itself taken as a measure of value? If the mere quantity
of labor functions as a measure of value regardless of quality, it presupposes
that simple labor has become the pivot of industry. It presupposes that
labor has been equalized by the subordination of man to the machine or
by the extreme division of labor; that men are effaced by their labor;
that the pendulum of the clock has become as accurate a measure of the
relative activity of two workers as it is of the speed of two locomotives.
Therefore, we should not say that one man’s hour is worth another man’s
hour, but rather that one man during an hour is worth just as much as another
man during an hour. Time is everything, man is nothing; he is, at the most,
time’s carcase. Quality no longer matters. Quantity alone decides everything;
hour for hour, day for day; but this equalizing of labor is not by any
means the work of M. Proudhon’s eternal justice; it is purely and simply
a fact of modern industry.

<p>In the automatic workshop, one worker’s labor is scarely distinguishable
in any way from another worker’s labor: workers can only be distinguished
one from another by the length of time they take for their work. Nevertheless,
this quantitative difference becomes, from a certain point of view, qualitative,
in that the time they take for their work depends partly on purely material
causes, such as physical constitution, age and sex; partly on purely negative
moral causes, such as patience, imperturbability, diligence. In short,
if there is a difference of quality in the labor of different workers,
it is at most a quality of the last kind, which is far from being a distinctive
speciality. This is what the state of affairs in modern industry amounts
to in the last analysis. It is upon this equality, already realized in
automatic labor, that M. Proudhon wields his smoothing-plane of “equalization,” 
which he means to establish universally in “time to come!”  

<p>All the “equalitarian” consequences which M. Proudhon deduces
from Ricardo's doctrine are based on a fundamental error. He confounds
the value of commodities measured by the quantity of labor embodied in
them with the value of commodities measured by “the value of labor.” If
these two ways of measuring the value of commodities were equivalent, it
could be said indifferently that the relative value of any commodity is
measured by the quantity of labor embodied in it; or that it is measured
by the quantity of labor it can buy; or again that it is measured by the
quantity of labor which can acquire it. But this is far from being so.
The value of labor can no more serve as a measure of value than the value
of any other commodity. A few examples will suffice to explain still better
what we have just stated.

<p>If a quarter of corn cost two days' labor instead of one, it
would have twice its original value; but it would not set in operation
double the quantity of labor, because it would contain no more nutritive
matter than before. Thus the value of the corn, measured by the quantity
of labor used to produce it, would have doubled; but measured either by
the quantity of labor it can buy or the quantity of labor with which it
can be bought, it would be far from having doubled. On the other hand,
if the same labor produced twice as many clothes as before, their relative
value would fall by half; but, nevertheless, this double quantity of clothing
would not thereby be reduced to disposing over only half the quantity of
labor, nor could the same labor command the double quantity of clothing;
for half the clothes would still go on rendering the worker the same service
as before.

<p>Thus it is going against economic facts to determine the relative
value of commodities by the value of labor. It is moving in a vicious circle,
it is to determine relative value by a relative value which itself needs
to be determined.

<p>It is beyond doubt that M. Proudhon confuses the two measures,
measure by the labor time needed for the production of a commodity and
measure by the value of the labor. “Any man's labor,” he says, “can buy
the value it represents.” Thus, according to him, a certain quantity of
labor embodied in a product is equivalent to the worker's payment, that
is, to the value of labor. It is the same reasoning that makes him confuse
cost of production with wages.

<p class="quoteb"> “What are wages? They are the cost price of corn, etc., the integral
price of all things.” 

<p>
Let us go still further.

<p class="quoteb"> “Wages are the proportionality of the elements which compose wealth.” 
What are wages? They are the value of labor.

<p>
Adam Smith takes as the measure of value, now the time of labor needed
for the production of a commodity, now the value of labor. Ricardo exposes
this error by showing clearly the disparity of these two ways of measuring.
M. Proudhon goes one better than Adam Smith in error by identifying the
two things which the latter had merely put in juxtaposition.

<p>It is in order to find the proper proportion in which workers
should share in the products, or, in other words, to determine the relative
value of labor, that M. Proudhon seeks a measure for the relative value
of commodities. To find out the measure for the relative value of commodities he
can think of nothing better than to give as the equivalent of a certain
quantity of labor the sum total of the products it has created, which is
as good as supposing that the whole of society consists merely of workers
who receive their own produce as wages. In the second place, he takes for
granted the equivalence of the working days of different workers. In short,
he seeks the measure of the relative value of commoditiesin order to arrive at equal payment for the workers, and he takes the equality of wages as an already established fact, in order to go off on the search for the relative value of commodities. What admirable dialectics!

<p class="quoteb"> “Say and the economists after him have observed that labor being itself
subject to valuation, being a commodity like any other commodity, it is
moving in a vicious circle to treat it as the principle and the determining
cause of value. In so doing, these economists, if they will allow me to
say so, show a prodigious carelessness. Labor is said to have value not
as a commodity itself, but in view of the values which it is supposed potentially
to contain. The value of labor is a figurative expression, an anticipation
of the cause for the effect. It is a fiction of the same stamp as the productivity
of capital. Labor produces, capital has value....

<p class="quoteb"> “By a sort of ellipsis one speaks of the value of labor....

<p class="quoteb"> “Labor like liberty... is a thing vague and indeterminate by nature,
but defined qualitatively by its object, that is to say, it becomes a reality
by the product.” 

</p>
<p class="inline">[I 61]</p>
<p>
<p class="quoteb"> “But is there any need to dwell on this? The moment the economist (read
M. Proudhon) changes the name of things, vera rerum vocabula <span class="inote">[the true
name of things]</span>, he is implicitly confessing his impotence and proclaiming
himself not privy to the cause." 

</p>
<p class="inline">(Proudhon, I, 188)</p>
<p>
We have seen that M. Proudhon makes the value of labor the “determining
cause” of the value of products to such an extent that for him wages, the
official name for the “value of labor,” form the integral price of all
things: that is why Say's objection troubles him. In labor as a commodity,
which is a grim reality, he sees nothing but a grammatical ellipsis. Thus
the whole of existing society, founded on labor as a commodity, is henceforth
founded on a poetic licence, a figurative expression. If society wants
to “eliminate all the drawbacks” that assail it, well, let it eliminate
all the ill-sounding terms, change the language; and to this end it has
only to apply to the Academy for a new edition of its dictionary. After
all that we have just seen, it is easy for us to understand why M. Proudhon,
in a work on political economy, has to enter upon long dissertations on
etymology and other parts of grammar. Thus he is still learnedly discussing
the antiquated derivation of <i>servus</i> <span class="inote">[a slave, servant]</span> from <i>servare</i> <span class="inote">[To preserve]</span>. These philological
dissertations have a deep meaning, an esoteric meaning – they form an
essential part of M. Proudhon's argument.

<p>Labor <span class="note"><a href="#3" id="3b">[3]</a></span>, inasmuch as it is bought and sold,
is a commodity like any other commodity, and has, in consequence, an exchange
value. But the value of labor, or labor as a commodity, produces as little
as the value of wheat, or wheat as a commodity, serves as food.

<p>Labor “is worth” more or less, according to whether food commodities
are more or less dear, whether the supply and demand of hands exist to
such or such a degree, etc., etc.

<p>Labor is not a “vague thing"; it is always some definite labor,
it is never labor in general that is bought and sold. It is not only labor
that is qualitatively defined by the object; but also the object which
is determined by the specific quality of labor.

<p>Labor, in so far as it is bought and sold, is itself a commodity.
Why is it bought? “Because of the values it is supposed potentially to
contain.” But if a certain thing is said to be a commodity, there is no
longer any question as to the reason why it is bought, that is, as to the
utility to be derived from it, the application to be made of it. It is
a commodity as an object of traffic. All M. Proudhon's arguments are limited
to this: labor is not bought as an immediate object of consumption. No,
it is bought as an instrument of production, as a machine would be bought.
As a commodity, labor has no value and does not produce. M. Proudhon might
just as well have said that there is no such thing as a commodity, since
every commodity is obtained merely for some utilitarian purpose, and never
as a commodity in itself.

<p>In measuring the value of commodities by labor, M. Proudhon vaguely
glimpses the impossibility of excluding labor from this same measure, in
so far as labor has a value, as labor is a commodity. He has a misgiving
that it is turning the wage minimum into the natural and normal price of
immediate labor, that it is accepting the existing state of society. So,
to get away from this fatal consequence, he faces about and asserts that
labor is not a commodity, that it cannot have value. He forgets that he
himself has taken the value of labor as a measure, he forgets that his
whole system rests on labor as a commodity, on labor which is bartered,
bought, sold, exchanged for produce, etc., on labor, in fact, which is
an immediate source of income for the worker. He forgets everything.

<p>To save his system, he consents to sacrifice its basis.


<p>
Et propter vitam vivendi perdere causas!
</p>
<p>We now come to a new definition of “constituted value.” 

<p class="quoteb"> “Value is the proportional relation of the products which constitute
wealth.” 

<p>
Let us note in the first place that the single phrase “relative or exchange
value” implies the idea of some relation in which products are exchanged
reciprocally. By giving the name “proportional relation” to this relation,
no change is made in the relative value, except in the expression. Neither
the depreciation nor the enhancement of the value of a product destroys
its quality of being in some “proportional relation” with the other products
which constitute wealth.

<p>Why then this new term, which introduces no new idea?

<p> “Proportional relation” suggests many other economic relations,
such as proportionality in production, the true proportion between supply
and demand, etc., and M. Proudhon is thinking of all that when he formulates
this didactic paraphrase of marketable value.

<p>In the first place, the relative value of products being determined
by the comparative amount of labor used in the production of each of them,
proportional relations, applied to this special case, stand for the respective
quota of products which can be manufactured in a given time, and which
in consequence are given in exchange for one another.

<p>Let us see what advantage M. Proudhon draws from this proportional
relation.

<p>Everyone knows that when supply and demand are evenly balanced,
the relative value of any product is accurately determined by the quantity
of labor embodied in it, that is to say, that this relative value expresses
the proportional relation precisely in the sense we have just attached
to it. M. Proudhon inverts the order of things. Begin, he says, by measuring
the relative value of a product by the quantity of labor embodied in it,
and supply and demand will infallibly balance one another. Production will
correspond to consumption, the product will always be exchangeable. Its
current price will express exactly its true value. Instead of saying like
everyone else: when the weather is fine, a lot of people are to be seen
going out for a walk. M. Proudhon makes his people go out for a walk in
order to be able to ensure them fine weather.

<p>What M. Proudhon gives as the consequence of marketable value
determined a priori by labor time could be justified only by a law couched
more or less in the following terms:

<p>Products will in future be exchanged in the exact ratio of the
labor time they have cost. Whatever may be the proportion of supply to
demand, the exchange of commodities will always be made as if they had
been produced proportionately to the demand. Let M. Proudhon take it upon
himself to formulate and lay down such a law, and we shall relieve him
of the necessity of giving proofs. If, on the other hand, he insists on
justifying his theory, not as a legislator, but as an economist, he will
have to prove that the time needed to create a commodity indicates exactly
the degree of its utility and marks its proportional relation to the demand,
and in consequence, to the total amount of wealth. In this case, if a product
is sold at a price equal to its cost of production, supply and demand will
always be evenly balanced; for the cost of production is supposed to express
the true relation between supply and demand.

<p>Actually, M. Proudhon sets out to prove that labor time needed
to create a product indicates its true proportional relation to needs,
so that the things whose production costs the least time are the most immediately
useful, and so on, step by step. The mere production of a luxury object
proves at once, according to this doctrine, that society has spare time
which allows it to satisfy a need for luxury.

<p>M. Proudhon finds the very proof of his thesis in the observation
that the most useful things cost the least time to produce, that society
always begins with the easiest industries and successively “starts on the
production of objects which cost more labor time and which correspond to
a higher order of needs.” 

<p>M. Proudhon borrows from M. Dunoyer the example of extractive
industry – fruit-gathering, pasturage, hunting, fishing, etc. – which
is the simplest, the least costly of industries, and the one by which man
began “the first day of his second creation.”  The first day of his first
creation is recorded in Genesis, which shows God as the world's first manufacturer.

<p>Things happen in quite a different way from what M. Proudhon imagines.
The very moment civilization begins, production begins to be founded on
the antagonism of orders, estates, classes, and finally on the antagonism
of accumulated labor and actual labor. No antagonism, no progress. This
is the law that civilization has followed up to our days. Till now the
productive forces have been developed by virtue of this system of class
antagonisms. To say now that, because all the needs of all the workers
were satisfied, men could devote themselves to the creation of products
of a higher order – to more complicated industries – would be to leave
class antagonism out of account and turn all historical development upside
down. It is like saying that because, under the Roman emperors, muraena
were fattened in artificial fishponds, therefore there was enough to feed
abundantly the whole Roman population. Actually, on the contrary, the Roman
people had not enough to buy bread with, while the Roman aristocrats had
slaves enough to throw as fodder to the muraena.

<p>The price of food has almost continuously risen, while the price
of manufactured and luxury goods has almost continuously fallen. Take the
agricultural industry itself; the most indispensable objects, like corn,
meat, etc., rise in price, while cotton, sugar, coffee, etc., fall in a
surprising proportion. And even among comestibles proper, the luxury articles,
like artichokes, asparagus, etc., are today relatively cheaper than foodstuffs
of prime necessity. In our age, the superfluous is easier to produce than
the necessary. Finally, at different historical epochs, the reciprocal
price relations are not only different, but opposed to one another. In
the whole of the Middle Ages, agricultural products were relatively cheaper
than manufactured products; in modern times they are in inverse ratio.
Does this mean that the utility of agricultural products has diminished
since the Middle Ages?

<p>The use of products is determined by the social conditions in
which the consumers find themselves placed, and these conditions themselves
are based on class antagonism.

<p>Cotton, potatoes and spirits are objects of the most common use.
Potatoes have engendered scrofula; cotton has to a great extent driven
out flax and wool, although wool and flax are, in many cases, of greater
utility, if only from the point of view of hygiene; finally, spirits have
got the upper hand of beer and wine, although spirits used as an alimentary
substance are everywhere recognized to be poison. For a whole century,
governments struggled in vain against the European opium; economics prevailed,
and dictated its orders to consumption.

<p>Why are cotton, potatoes and spirits the pivots of bourgeois society?
Because the least amount of labor is needed to produce them, and, consequently,
they have the lowest price. Why does the minimum price determine the maximum
consumption? Is it by any chance because of the absolute utility of these
objects, their intrinsic utility, their utility insomuch as they correspond,
in the most useful manner, in the needs of the worker as a man, and not
to the man as a worker? No, it is because in a society founded on poverty
the poorest products have the fatal prerogative of being used by the greatest
number.

<p>To say now that because the least costly things are in greater
use, they must be of greater utility, is saying that the wide use of spirits,
because of their low cost of production, is the most conclusive proof of
their utility; it is telling the proletarian that potatoes are more wholesome
for him than meat; it is accepting the present state of affairs; it is,
in short, making an apology, with M. Proudhon, for a society without understanding
it.

<p>In a future society, in which class antagonism will have ceased,
in which there will no longer be any classes, use will no longer be determined
by the minimum time of production; but the time of production devoted to
different articles will be determined by the degree of their social utility.

<p>To return to M. Proudhon's thesis: the moment the labor time necessary
for the production of an article ceases to be the expression of its degree
of utility, the exchange value of this same article, determined beforehand
by the labor time embodied in it, becomes quite usable to regulate the
true relation of supply to demand, that is, the proportional relation in
the sense M. Proudhon at the moment attributes to it.

<p>It is not the sale of a given product at the price of its cost
of production that constitutes the “proportional relation” of supply to
demand, or the proportional quota of this product relatively to the sum
total of production; it is the variations in supply and demand that show
the producer what amount of a given commodity he must produce in order
to receive in exchange at least the cost of production. And as these variations
are continually occurring, there is also a continual movement of withdrawl
and application of capital in the different branches of industry.

<p class="quoteb"> “It is only in consequence of such variations that capital is apportioned
precisely, in the requisite abundance and no more, to the production of
the different commodities which happen to be in demand. With the rise or
fall of price, profits are elevated above, or depressed below their general
level, and capital is either encouraged to enter into, or is warned to
depart from, the particular employment in which the variation has taken
place.” 

<p class="quoteb"> “When we look at the markets of a large town, and observe how
regularly they are supplied both with home and foreign commodities, in
the quantity in which they are required, under all the circumstances of
varying demand, arising from the caprice of taste, or a change in the amount
of population, without often producing either the effects of a glut from
a too abundant supply, or an enormously high price from the supply being
unequal to the demand, we must confess that the principle which apportions
capital to each trade in the precise amount that is required, is more active
than is generally supposed.” 

</p>
<p class="inline">(Ricardo, Vol.I, pp.105 and 108)</p>
<p>
If M. Proudhon admits that the value of products is determined by labor
time, he should equally admit that it is the fluctuating movement alone
that in society founded on individual exchanges make labor the measure
of value. There is no ready-made constituted “proportional relation,” but
only a constituting movement.

<p>We have just seen in what sense it is correct to speak of “proportion” 
as of a consequence of value determined by labor time. We shall see now
how this measure by time, called by M. Proudhon the “law of proportion,” 
becomes transformed into a law of <i>disproportion</i>.

<p>Every new invention that enables the production in one hour of
that which has hitherto been produced in two hours depreciates all similar
products on the market. Competition forces the producer to sell the product
of two hours as cheaply as the product of one hour. Competition carries
into effect the law according to which the relative value of a product
is determined by the labor time needed to produce it. Labor time serving
as the measure of marketable value becomes in this way the law of the continual
depreciation of labor. We will say more. There will be depreciation not
only of the commodities brought into the market, but also of the instruments
of production and of whole plants. This fact was already pointed out by
Ricardo when he said:

<p class="quoteb"> “By constantly increasing the facility of production, we constantly
diminish the value of some of the commodities before produced.” 

</p>
<p class="inline">(Vol.II, p.59)</p>
<p>
Sismondi goes further. He sees in this “value constituted” by labor time,
the source of all the contradictions of modern industry and commerce.

<p class="quoteb"> “Mercantile value,” he says, “is always determined in the long run
by the quantity of labor needed to obtain the thing evaluated: it is not
what it has actually cost, but what it would cost in the future with, perhaps,
perfected means; and this quantity, although difficult to evaluate, is
always faithfully established by competition....

<p class="quoteb"> “It is on this basis that the demand of the seller as well as
the supply of the buyer is reckoned. The former will perhaps declare that
the thing has cost him 10 days' labor; but if the latter realizes that
it can henceforth be produced with eight days' labor, in the event of competition
proving this to the two contracting parties, the value will be reduced,
and the market price fixed at eight days only. Of course, each of the parties
believes that the thing is useful, that it is desired, that without desire
there would be no sale; but the fixing of the price has nothing to do with
utility." 

</p>
<p class="inline">(<i>Etudes, etc.</i>, Vol.II, p.267)</p>
<p>
It is important to emphasize the point that what determines value is not
the time taken to produce a thing, but the minimum time it could possibly
be produced in, and the minimum is ascertained by competition. Suppose
for a moment that there is no more competition and consequently no longer
any means to ascertain the minimum of labor necessary for the production
of a commodity; what will happen? It will suffice to spend six hours' work on
the production of an object, in order to have the right, according to M.
Proudhon, to demand in exchange six times as much as the one who has taken
only one hour to produce the same object.

<p>Instead of a “proportional relation,” we have a disproportional
relation, at any rate if we insist on sticking to relations, good or bad.

<p>The continual depreciation of labor is only one side, one consequence
of the evaluation of commodities by labor time. The excessive raising of
prices, overproduction and many other features of industrial anarchy have
their explanation in this mode of evaluation.

<p>But does labor time used as a measure of value give rise at least
to the proportional variety of products that so delights M. Proudhon?

<p>On the contrary, monopoly in all its monotony follows in its wake
and invades the world of products, just as to everybody's knowledge monopoly
invades the world of the instruments of production. It is only in a few
branches of industry, like the cotton industry, that very rapid progress
can be made. The natural consequence of this progress is that the products
of cotton manufacture, for instance, fall rapidly in price: but as the
price of cotton goes down, the price of flax will be replaced by cotton.
In this way, flax has been driven out of almost the whole of North America.
And we have obtained, instead of the proportional variety of products,
the dominance of cotton.

<p>What is left of this “proportional relation"? Nothing but the
pious wish of an honest man who would like commodities to be produced in
proportions which would permit of their being sold at an honest price.
In all ages good-natured bourgeois and philanthropic economists have taken
pleasure in expressing this innocent wish.

<p>Let us hear what old Boisguillebert says:

<p class="quoteb"> “The price of commodities,” he says, “must always be proportionate;
for it is such mutual understanding alone that can enable them to exist
together so as to give themselves to one another at any moment (here is
M. Proudhon's continual exchangeability) and reciprocally give birth to
one another. ...

<p class="quoteb"> "As wealth, then, is nothing but this continual intercourse between
man and man, craft and craft, etc., it is a frightful blindness to go looking
for the cause of misery elsewhere than in the cessation of such traffic
brought about by a disturbance of proportion in prices."

Let us listen also to a modern economist:

<p class="quoteb"> “The great law as necessary to be affixed to production, that is, the
law of proportion, which alone can preserve the continuity of value....

<p class="quoteb"> “The equivalent must be guaranteed....

<p class="quoteb"> “All nations have attempted, at various periods of their history,
by instituting numerous commercial regulations and restrictions, to effect,
in some degree, the object here explained....

<p class="quoteb"> “But the natural and inherent selfishness of man... has urged him
to break down all such regulations. Proportionate Production is the realization
of the entire truth of the Science of Social Economy."

<br>London 1840, pp.170-95)</p>
<p>
<i>Fuit Troja</i>. <span class="inote">[Troy is no more.]</span> This true proportion between supply
and demand, which is beginning once more to be the object of so many wishes,
ceased long ago to exist. It has passed into the stage of senility. It
was possible only at a time when the means of production were limited,
when the movement of exchange took place within very restricted bounds.
With the birth of large-scale industry this true proportion had to come
to an end, and production is inevitably compelled to pass in continuous
succession through vicissitudes of prosperity, depression, crisis, stagnation,
renewed prosperity, and so on.

<p>Those who, like Sismondi, wish to return to the true proportion
of production, while preserving the present basis of society, are reactionary,
since, to be consistent, they must also wish to bring back all the other
conditions of industry of former times.

<p>What kept production in true, or more or less true, proportions?
It was demand that dominated supply, that preceded it. Production followed
close on the heels of consumption. Large-scale industry, forced by the
very instruments at its disposal to produce on an ever-increasing scale,
can no longer wait for demand. Production precedes consumption, supply
compels demands.

<p>In existing society, in industry based on individual exchange,
anarchy of production, which is the source of so much misery, is at the
same time the source of all progress.

<p>Thus, one or the other:

<p class="quoteb"> Either you want the true proportions of past centuries with present-day
means of production, in which case you are both reactionary and utopian.

<p>Or you want progress without anarchy: in which case, in order
to preserve the productive forces, you must abandon individual exchange.

<p>
Individual exchange is suited only to the small-scale industry of past
centuries with its corollary of “true proportion,” or else to large-scale
industry with all its train of misery and anarchy.

<p>After all, the determination of value by labor time – the formula
M. Proudhon gives us as the regenerating formula of the future – is therefore
merely the scientific expression of the economic relations of present-day
society, as was clearly and precisely demonstrated by Ricardo long before
M. Proudhon.

<p>But does the “equalitarian” application of this formula at least
belong to M. Proudhon? Was he the first to think of reforming society by
transforming all men into actual workers exchanging equal amounts of labor?
Is it really for him to reproach the Communists – these people devoid
of all knowledge of political economy, these “obstinately foolish men,” 
these “paradise dreamers” – with not having found, before him, this “solution
of the problem of the proletariat”?

<p>Anyone who is in any way familiar with the trend of political
economy in England cannot fail to know that almost all the Socialists in
that country have, at different periods, proposed the equalitarian application
of the Ricardian theory. We quote for M. Proudhon: Hodgskin, <i>Political
Economy</i>, 1827; William Thompson, <i>An Inquiry into the Principles
of the Distribution of Wealth Most Conducive to Human Happiness</i>, 1824;
T. R. Edmonds, <i>Practical Moral and Political Economy</i>, 1828 [18],
etc., etc., and four pages more of etc. We shall content ourselves with
listening to an English Communist, Mr. Bray. We shall give the decisive
passages in his remarkable work, <i>Labor's Wrongs and Labor's Remedy</i>,
Leeds, 1839, and we shall dwell some time upon it, firstly, because Mr.
Bray is still little known in France, and secondly, because we think that
we have discovered in him the key to the past, present and future works
of M. Proudhon.

<p class="quoteb"> “The only way to arrive at truth is to go at once to First Principles....
Let us... go at once to the source from whence governments themselves have
arisen.... By thus going to the origin of the thing, we shall find that
every form of government, and every social and governmental wrong, owes
its rise to the existing social system – to the institution of property
as it at present exists – and that, therefore, if we would end our wrongs
and our miseries at once and for ever, the present arrangements of society
must be totally subverted.... By thus fighting them upon their own ground,
and with their own weapons, we shall avoid that senseless clatter respecting
 ‘visionaries' and ‘theorists', with which they are so ready to assail all
who dare move one step from that beaten track which ‘by authority', has
been pronounced to be the right one. Before the conclusions arrived at
by such a course of proceeding can be overthrown, the economists must unsay
or disprove those established truths and principles on which their own
arguments are founded."

<p class="inline">(Bray, pp.17 and 41)</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “It is labor alone which bestows value....

<p class="quoteb"> “Every man has an undoubted right to all that his honest labor
can procure him. When he thus appropriates the fruits of his labor, he
commits no injustice upon any other human being; for he interferes with
no other man's right of doing the same with the produce of his labor....

<p class="quoteb"> “All these ideas of superior and inferior – of master and man
– may be traced to the neglect of First Principles, and to the consequent
rise of inequality of possessions; and such ideas will never be subverted,
so long as this inequality is maintained. Men have hitherto blindly hoped
to remedy the present unnatural state of things... by destroying existing
inequality; but it will be shortly seen... that misgovernment is not a
cause, but a consequence – that it is not the creator, but the created
– that is is the offspring of inequality of possessions; and that the
inequality of possessions is inseparably connected with our present social
system.”

<p class="quoteb"> “Not only are the greatest advantages, but strict justice also, on
the side of a system of equality.... Every man is a link, in the chain
of effects – the beginning of which is but an idea, and the end, perhaps,
the production of a piece of cloth. Thus, although we may entertain different
feelings towards the several parties, it does not follow that one should
be better paid for his labor than another. The inventor will ever receive,
in addition to his just pecuniary reward, that which genius only can obtain
from us – the tribune of our admiration....

<p class="quoteb"> “From the very nature of labor and exchange, strict justice not
only requires that all exchangers should be mutually, but that they should
likewise be equally, benefited. Men have only two things which they can
exchange with each other, namely, labor, and the produce of labor....

<p class="quoteb"> “If a just system of exchanges were acted upon, the value of articles
would be determined by the entire cost of production; and equal values
should always exchange for equal values. If, for instance, it takes a hatter
one day to make a hat, and a shoemaker the same time to make a pair of
shoes – supposing the material used by each to be of the same value –
and they exchange these articles with each other, they are not only mutually
but equally benefited: the advantage derived by either party cannot be
a disadvantage to the other, as each has given the same amount of labor,
and the materials made use of by each were of equal value. But if the hatter
should obtain two pair of shoes for one hat – time and value of material
being as before – the exchange would clearly be an unjust one. The hatter
would defraud the shoemaker of one day's labor; and were the former to
act thus in all his exchanges, he would receive, for the labor of half
a year, the product of some other person's whole year. We have heretofore
acted upon no other than this most unjust system of exchanges – the workmen
have given the capitalist the labor of a whole year, in exchange for the
value of only half a year – and from this, and not from the assumed inequality
of bodily and mental powers in individuals, has arisen the inequality of
wealth and power which at present exists around us. It is an inevitable
condition inequality of exchanges – of buying at one price and selling
at another – that capitalists shall continue to be capitalists, and working
men to be working men – the one a class of tyrants and the other a class
of slaves – to eternity....

<p class="quoteb"> “The whole transaction, therefore, plainly shews that the capitalists
and proprietors do no more than give the working man, for his labor of
one week, a part of the wealth which they obtained from him the week before!
– which amounts to giving him nothing for something....

<p class="quoteb"> “The whole transaction, therefore, between the producer and the
capitalist is a palpable deception, a mere farce: it is, in fact, in thousands
of instances, no other than a barefaced though legalized robbery."

<p class="quoteb"> “... the gain of the employer will never cease to be the loss of the
employed – until the exchanges between the parties are equal; and exchanges
never can be equal while society is divided into capitalists and producers

of that labor.

<p class="quoteb">  “It is plain that, establish whatever form
of government we will... we may talk of morality and brotherly love...
no reciprocity can exist where there are unequal exchanges. Inequality
of exchanges, as being the cause of inequality of possessions, is the secret
enemy that devours us."

<p class="quoteb"> “It has been deduced, also, from a consideration of the intention and
end of society, not only that all men should labor, and thereby become
exchangers, but that equal values should always exchange for equal values
– and that, as the gain of one man ought never to be the loss of another,
value should be determined by cost of production. But we have seen, that,
under the present arrangements of society... the gain of the capitalist
and the rich man is always the loss of the workman – that this result
will invariably take place, and the poor man be left entirely at the mercy
of the rich man, under any and every form of government, so long as there
is inequality of exchanges – and that equality of exchanges can be ensured
only under social arrangements in which labor is universal....

of labor and exchanges – can alter this state of rights....

every effort for their own redemption be made – and their chains will
be snapped asunder forever....

be the loss of another; for every exchange is then simply a transfer, and
not a sacrifice of labor and wealth. Thus, although under a social system
based on equal exchanges, a parsimonious man may become rich, his wealth
will be no more than the accumulated produce of his own labor. He may exchange
his wealth, or he may give it to others... but a rich man cannot continue
wealthy for any length of time after he has ceased to labor. Under equality
of exchanges, wealth cannot have, as it now has, a procreative and apparently
self-generating power, such as replenishes all waste from consumption;
for, unless it be renewed by labor, wealth, when once consumed, is given
up for ever. That which is now called profit and interest cannot exist
as such in connection with equality of exchanges; for producer and distributor
would be alike remunerated, and the sum total of their labor would determine
the value of the article created and brought to the hands of the consumer....

nature ensure universal labor."

<p>
After having refuted the objections of the economists to communism, Mr.
Bray goes on to say:

<p class="quoteb"> “If, then a changed character be essential to the success of the social
system of community in its most perfect form – and if, likewise, the present
system affords no circumstances and no facilities for effecting the requisite
change of character and preparing man for the higher and better state desired
– it is evident that these things must necessarily remain as they are....
or else some preparatory step must be discovered and made use of – some
movement partaking partly of the present and partly of the desired system
– some intermediate resting place, to which society may go with all its
faults and its follies, and from which it may move forward, imbued with
those qualities and attributes without which the system of community and
equality cannot as such have existence.” 

</p>
<p class="inline">(Bray, p.134)</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “The whole movement would require only co-operation in its simplest
form.... Cost of production would in every instance determine value; and
equal values would always exchange for equal values. If one person worked
a whole week, and another worked only half a week, the first would receive
double the remuneration of the last; but this extra pay of the one would
not be at the expense of the other, nor would the loss incurred by the
last man fall in any way upon the first. Each person would exchange the
wages he individually received for commodities of the same value as his
respective wages; and in no case could the gain of one man or one trade
be a loss to another man or another trade. The labor of every individual
would alone determine his gains of his losses....

<p class="quoteb"> “... By means of general and local boards of trade... the quantities
of the various commodities required for consumption – the relative value
of each in regard to each other – the number of hands required in various
trades and descriptions of labor – and all other matters connected with
production and distribution, could in a short time be as easily determined
for a nation as for an individual company under the present arrangements....

<p class="quoteb"> “As individuals compose families, and families towns, under the
existing system, so likewise would they after the joint-stock change had
been effected. The present distribution of people in towns and villages,
bad as it is, would not be directly interfered with....

<p class="quoteb"> “Under this joint-stock system, the same as under that now existing,
every individual would be at liberty to accumulate as much as he pleased,
and to enjoy such accumulations when and where he might think proper....

<p class="quoteb"> “The great productive section of the community... is divided into
an indefinite number of smaller sections, all working, producing and exchanging
their products on a footing of the most perfect equality....

<p class="quoteb"> “And the joint-stock modification (which is nothing but a concession
to present-day society in order to obtain communism), by being so constituted
as to admit of individual property in productions in connection with a
common property in productive powers – making every individual dependent
on his own exertions, and at the same time allowing him an equal participation
in every advantage afforded by nature and art – is fitted to take society
as it is, and to prepare the way for other and better changes."

We now only need to reply in a few words to Mr. Bray who without us and
in spite of us had managed to supplant M. Proudhon, except that Mr. Bray,
far from claiming the last word on behalf of humanity, proposes merely
measures which he thinks good for a period of transition between existing
society and a community regime.

<p>One hour of Peter's labor exchanges for one hour of Paul's labor.
That is Mr. Bray's fundamental axiom.

<p>Let us suppose Peter has 12 hours' labor before him, and Paul
only six. Peter will consequently have six hours' labor left over. What
will he do with these six hours' labor?

<p>Either he will do nothing with them – in which case he will have
worked six hours for nothing; or else he will remain idle for another six
hours to get even; or else, as a last resource, he will give these six
hours' labor, which he has no use for, to Paul into the bargain.

<p>What in the end will Peter have earned more than Paul? Some hours
of labor? No! He will have gained only hours of leisure; he will be forced
to play the loafer for six hours. And in order that this new right to loaf
might be not only relished but sought after in the new society, this society
would have to find in idleness its highest bliss, and to look upon labor
as a heavy shackle from which it must break free at all costs.

<p>And indeed, to return to our example, if only these hours of leisure
that Peter had gained in excess of Paul were really a gain! Not in the
least. Paul, beginning by working only six hours, attains by steady and
regular work a result that Peter secures only by beginning with an excess
of work. Everyone will want to be Paul, there will be a competition to
occupy Paul's position, a competition in idleness.

<p>Well, then! What has the exchange of equal quantities of labor
brought us? Overproduction, depreciation, excess of labor followed by unemployment;
in short, economic relations such as we see in present-day society, minus
the competition of labor.

<p>No! We are wrong! These is still an expedient which may save this
new society of Peters and Pauls. Peter will consume by himself the product
of the six hours' labor which he has left. But from the moment he has no
longer to exchange because he has produced, he has no need to produce for
exchange; and the whole hypothesis of a society founded on the exchange
and division of labor will fall to the ground. Equality of exchange will
have been saved by the simple fact that exchange will have ceased to be:
Paul and Peter would arrive at the position of Robinson.

<p>Thus, if all the members of society are supposed to be actual
workers, the exchange of equal quantities of hours of labor is possible
only on condition that the number of hours to be spent on material production
is agreed on before hand. But such an agreement negates individual exchange.

<p>We still come to the same result, if we take as our starting point
not the distribution of the products created but the act of production.
In large-scale industry, Peter is not free to fix for himself the time
of his labor, for Peter's labor is nothing without the co-operation of
all the Peters and all the Pauls who make up the workshop. This explains
very well the dogged resistance which the English factory owners put up
to the <a href="../../../../../glossary/terms/t/e.html#ten-hours-bill" target=_blank>Ten Hours' Bill</a>. They knew only too well that a two-hours' reduction
of labor granted to women and children would carry
with it an equal reduction of working hours for adult men. It is in the
nature of large-scale industry that working hours should be equal for all.
What is today the result of capital and the competition of workers among
themselves will be tomorrow, if you sever the relation between labor and
capital, an actual agreement based upon the relation between the sum of
productive forces and the sum of existing needs.

<p>But such an agreement is a condemnation of individual exchange,
and we are back again at our first conclusion!

<p>In principle, there is no exchange of products – but there is
the exchange of the labor which co-operated in production. The mode of
exchange of products depends upon the mode of exchange of the productive
forces. In general, the form of exchange of products corresponds to the
form of production. Change the latter, and the former will change in consequence.
Thus in the history of society we see that the mode of exchanging products
is regulated by the mode of producing them. Individual exchange corresponds
also to a definite mode of production which itself corresponds to class
antagonism. There is thus no individual exchange without the antagonism
of classes.

<p>But the respectable conscience refuses to see this obvious fact.
So long as one is a bourgeois, one cannot but see in this relation of antagonism
a relation of harmony and eternal justice, which allows no one to gain
at the expense of another. For the bourgeois, individual exchange can exist
without any antagonism of classes. For him, these are two quite unconnected
things. Individual exchange, as the bourgeois conceives it, is far from
resembling individual exchange as it actually exists in practice.

<p>Mr. Bray turns the illusion of the respectable bourgeois into
an ideal he would like to attain. In a purified individual exchange, freed
from all the elements of antagonism he finds in it, he sees an “equalitarian" 
relation which he would like society to adopt generally.

<p>Mr. Bray does not see that this equalitarian relation, this corrective
ideal that he would like to apply to the world, is itself nothing but the
reflection of the actual world; and that therefore it is totally impossible
to reconstitute society on the basis of what is merely an embellished shadow
of it. In proportion as this shadow takes on substance again, we perceive
that this substance, far from being the transfiguration dreamt of, is the
actual body of existing society. <span class="note"><a href="#4" id="4b">[*3]</a></span>

Ricardo, as is well known, determines the value of a commodity by the quantity
of labor necessary for its production. Owing, however, to the prevailing
form of exchange in every mode of production based on production of commodities,
including therefore the capitalist mode of production, this value is not
expressed directly in quantities of labor but in quantities of some other
commodity. The value of a commodity expressed in a quantity of some other
commodity (whether money or not) is termed by Ricardo its relative value. [Note by Engels to 1885 German edition]

The thesis that the “natural,” i.e., normal, price of labor
power coincides with the wage minimum, i.e., with the equivalent in value
of the means of subsistence absolutely indispensable for the life and procreation
of the worker, was first put forward by me in <i><a href="../../1844/df-jahrbucher/outlines.html" target=_blank>Sketches for a Critique
of Political Economy</a></i> (<a href="../../1844/df-jahrbucher/index.html" target=_blank>Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher </a>, Paris 1844) and in <i><a href="../../1845/condition-working-class/index.html" target=_blank>The Condition of the Working Class in England
in 1844</a></i>. As seen here, Marx at that time excepted the thesis. Lassalle
took it over from both of us. Although, however, in reality wages have
a constant tendency to approach the minimum, the above thesis is nevertheless
incorrect. The fact that labor is regularly and on the average paid below
its value cannot alter its value. In <i>Capital</i>, Marx has put the above
thesis right (Section on <a href="../../1867-c1/ch06.html" target=_blank>Buying and Selling Labor of Power</a>) and also (Chapter
25: <a href="../../1867-c1/ch25.html" target=_blank>The General Law of Capitalist Accumulation</a>) analyzed the circumstances
which permit capitalist production to depress the price of labor power
more and more below its value.[Note by Engels to 1885 German edition]

 In the copy Marx presented to N. Utina
in 1876 after this word “labor” Marx adds “labor power"; this addition
is found in the 1896 French edition.

Mr. Bray's theory,
like all theories, has found supporters who have allowed themselves to
be deluded by appearances. Equitable labor-exchange bazaars have been set
up in London, Sheffield, Leeds and many other towns in England. These bazaars
have all ended in scandalous failures after having absorbed considerable
capital. The taste for them has gone for ever. You are warned, M. Proudhon! 
[Note by Marx]
</p>
<p>
It is known
that Proudhon did not take this warning to heart. In 1849 he himself made
an attempt with a new Exchange Bank in Paris. The bank, however, failed
before it had got going properly: a court case against Proudhon had to
serve to cover its collapse. [Note by Engels, 1885 German Edition]

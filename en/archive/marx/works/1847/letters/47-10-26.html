<h4>Brussels, 26 October 1847<br>
rue d'Orléans, 42, Faubourg Namur</h4>
<p>Dear Herwegh,</p>
<p>I wanted to give Engels a letter to bring you, but there was so much pressing business on the day of his departure that this was lost sight of and forgotten.</p>
<p>I had further been asked by Countess Hatzfeld to write you a few lines of introduction for her. I imagine that by now you will already have made her acquaintance. For a <i>German woman</i>, she has developed great vigour sparring with her husband.<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#179" target=_blank>[179]</a></sup></p>
<p>Here in Brussels we have founded two public democratic societies.</p>
<p>1. A German Workers’ Society<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#158" target=_blank>[158]</a></sup> which already has about 100 members. Besides debates of quite a parliamentary nature, there is also social entertainment with singing, recitation, theatricals and the like.</p>
<p>2. A smaller cosmopolitan-democratic society to which Belgians, French, Poles, Swiss and Germans belong. <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#159" target=_blank>[159]</a></sup></p>
<p>If you come up here again you'll find that even in little Belgium more can be done by way of direct propaganda than in big France. Moreover, I believe that, however minor it may be, public activity is infinitely refreshing for everyone.</p>
<p>It is possible, there being now a <i>liberal</i> ministry <span class="context">[formed in August 1847]</span> at the helm, that we shall run into some trouble with the police, for liberals always remain liberals.</p>
<p>But we shall be able to deal with them. Here it is not as in Paris, where foreigners confront the government in isolation.</p>
<p>Since it is impossible in present circumstances to make any use of the book trade in Germany, I have agreed with Germans from Germany to produce a review-monthly — supported by subscriptions to shares.<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#167" target=_blank>[167]</a></sup> In the Rhine Province and Baden a number of shares have already been bought up. We intend to make a start as soon as there’s enough money to last 3 months.</p>
<p>If subscriptions in any way permitted, we would establish our own type-setting room here, Which could also be used for printing separate works.</p>
<p>Now I should like you to tell me:</p>
<p>1. Whether you, for your part, would also be prepared to drum up a few subscriptions for shares (25 talers per share).</p>
<p>2. Whether you are prepared to collaborate and to figure as a collaborator on the title page.</p>
<p>But I would ask you, since you have in any case long owed me a letter, to overcome for once your aversion to writing and to reply <i>soon</i>. I also wanted to request you to ask <i>Bakunin</i> by what route, to what address and by what means a letter can be conveyed to <i>Tolstoy.</i></p>
<p>My wife sends her warm regards to you and your wife.</p>
<p>The strange business of the Prussian Embassy in Paris<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#180" target=_blank>[180]</a></sup> is certainly indicative of our sovereign’s <span class="context">[Frederick William IV of Prussia]</span> mounting and impotent rage.</p>
<p>Farewell.</p>
<p>Your<br>
Marx</p>

<p>Dear Herwegh,</p>

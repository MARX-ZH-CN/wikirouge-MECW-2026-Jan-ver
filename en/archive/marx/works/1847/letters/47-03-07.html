<h4>Brussels, 7 March 1847</h4>
<p>Dear Daniels,</p>
<p><i>You or one of the others in Cologne</i> may get a letter from Hess about communist affairs. I would urgently ask that <i>none</i> of <i>you</i> should answer until I have provided you with documents and letters through W <span class="context">[probably Georg Weerth or Joseph Weydemeyer]</span>. At all events, I must again <i>urgently</i> request you to <i>come here. </i>I have some important things to tell you which cannot be communicated by post. If <i>you </i>can’t come, then H. Bürgers must spend a few days here. You or your representative will stay with me .... <span class="context">[remainder of the letter is missing, save for the next sentences, which are written in the margin. After the words ‘with me’ Marx added ‘see above']</span></p>
<p>So either you or H. Bürgers come to <i>Malines</i> as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Forward the enclosed letter to <i>Zulauff</i>,<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#145" target=_blank>[145]</a></sup> Grünstrasse, Elberfeld.</p>
<p>Do not come to <i>Brussels</i> but to <i>Malines</i> and write the day before to say when you or Bürgers are coming.</p>
<p>You can neglect your bourgeois affairs for a day or two.</p>
<p>Your<br>
Marx</p>

<p>Dear Herwegh,</p>
<p>Engels has just arrived here for a few weeks from Paris, <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#155" target=_blank>[155]</a></sup> whence he has brought the following anecdote; I should be glad if you would elucidate it at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>Bernays told Ewerbeck: Herwegh came to see me and said that Marx had welcomed him in such a friendly manner that he seemed <i>to want something </i>of him. Bernays then gave Ewerbeck his unqualified permission to pass on this <i>bon</i> <i>mot.</i></p>
<p>I would not, of course, put pen to paper on account of this piece of gossip had it not achieved a kind of notoriety among my acquaintances in Paris.</p>
<p>I would therefore request you to tell me categorically by return whether or not there is any truth in this.</p>
<p>Your<br>
Marx</p>

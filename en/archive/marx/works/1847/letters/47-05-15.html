<h4>Brussels, 15 May 1847</h4>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>As you know, Vogler has been under arrest in Aachen since the beginning of May. <span class="context">[The original is inaccurate: Vogler was arrested at the beginning of April 1847 and returned to Brussels on 17 June]</span> This has for the time being precluded the possibility of getting the pamphlet <span class="context">[Engels, The Constitutional Question in Germany]</span> you sent here into print. The first 1/3 of it I liked very much. The other 2/3 will in any case need some alteration. Something more specific on this point in my next.</p>
<p>I enclose the print of your cartoon. I sent it to the <i>Brüsseler-Zeitung</i>.<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#153" target=_blank>[153]</a></sup></p>
<p>As for the truly nauseous article by Grün or his associates in the <i>Trier’sche Zeitung</i> <span class="context">[Reference to a report from Paris of 13 April published in the section ‘Frankreich’ of the Trier’sche Zeitung, No. 107, 17 April 1847]</span> it is of course now too late; it would have been good if at the outset you had published a two-line counterstatement in the same rag.</p>
<p>I cannot go to London, not having sufficient funds. But we hope to send Wolff over. And then it will be enough that the two of you are there.<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#154" target=_blank>[154]</a></sup></p>
<p><i>Voce</i> <span class="context">[as regards]</span> money:</p>
<p>You will remember that <i>Hess </i>owes me and my brother-in-law Edgar <span class="context">[von Westphalen]</span> money from the <i>Gesellschaftsspiegel</i>. So I am drawing a bill on him from here, <i>payable </i>30 days at <i>sight. Bernays</i> likewise has owed me <i>150 fr</i>. since May of last year. So he too will also be presented with a bill.</p>
<p>I would therefore ask you to do the following:</p>
<p>1. First send me the addresses of both;</p>
<p>2. Inform both of them of the facts and tell the jackasses</p>
<p>3. that if they believe they will be unable to pay the respective sums by 15 June, they are nevertheless to <i>accept </i>the bills. I shall then arrange for <i>cover </i>in Paris. Naturally you will <i>only</i> inform the jackasses of the <i>latter</i> if absolutely unavoidable.</p>
<p>At the moment I'm in such financial straits that I have had to have recourse to drawing bills, and after all I don’t intend to make the two jackasses a present of anything. Should the asses only <i>feign</i> acceptance of the bills, I must, of course, know at once.</p>
<p>Since the matter is <i>very pressing, </i>I expect you not to let a day go by before setting everything in order and <i>informing</i> me.</p>
<p>Here in Brussels I have managed to hunt out an <i>escompteur. </i><span class="context">[bill discounter]</span></p>
<p>I cannot write to you at any greater length. About 12 days ago Breyer let a <i>vein</i>, but in my <i>right</i> arm instead of the <i>left. </i>Since I went on working as though nothing had happened, the wound festered instead of closing. The thing could have been dangerous and cost me my arm. Now it’s as good as healed. But the arm’s still weak. Mustn’t be overtaxed.</p>
<p>Your<br>
Marx</p>
<p class="quoteb">[From Gigot]</p>
<p class="quoteb">My dear Fritzchen,</p>
<p class="quoteb">I am just in the middle of reading your pamphlet — so far it has amused me greatly — and feel really happy that I ain’t no German. May God or Reason or Race preserve us from the petty bourgeoisie!</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>Avec laquelle j'ai l'honneur d'être</i>. <span class="context">[with which I have the honour to be]</span></p>
<p class="quoteb">Yours most truly<br>
Philippe</p>
<p class="quoteb">P.S. Do drop me <i>un demi mot</i> <span class="context">[a few words]</span> sometime.</p>

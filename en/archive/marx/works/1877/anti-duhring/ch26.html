<title>1877: Anti-Duhring - Distribution</title>

<p class="title">Anti-Dühring by Frederick Engels 1877<br>
Part III: Socialism</p>
<a id="c4"></a>
<h1>IV. Distribution</h1>
<p class="fst">We have already seen that Dühringian economics comes down to the
following proposition: the capitalist mode of <i>production is</i> quite
good, and can remain in existence, but the capitalist mode of <i>distribution
is</i> of evil, and must disappear. We now find that Herr Dühring's
“socialitarian” system is nothing more than the carrying through of
this principle in fantasy. In fact, it turned out that Herr Dühring has
practically nothing to take exception to in the mode of production — as
such — of capitalist society, that he wants to retain the old division of
labour in all its essentials, and that he consequently has hardly a word to say
in regard to production within his economic commune. Production is indeed a
sphere in which robust facts are dealt with, and in which consequently
“rational fantasy” {D. Ph. 46} should give but little scope to the
soaring of its free soul, because the danger of making a disgraceful blunder is
too great. It is quite otherwise with distribution — which in Herr
Dühring's view has no connection whatever with production and is determined not
by production but by a pure act of the will — distribution is the
predestined field of his “social alchemising” {D. K. G. 237}. <a id="117"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">To the equal obligation to produce corresponds the equal
right to consume, exercised in an organised manner in the economic commune and
in the trading commune embracing a large number of economic communes.
“Labour” is here “exchanged for other labour on the basis of
equal valuation... Service and counterservice represent here real equality
between quantities of labour” {D. C. 256}. And this “equalisation
of human energies” applies “whether the individuals have in fact
done more or less, or perhaps <i>even nothing at all”</i> {D. Ph. 281};
for all performances, in so far as they involve time and energy, can be
regarded as labour done — therefore even playing bowls or going for a
walk {see D. C. 266}. This exchange, however, does not take place between
individuals as the community is the owner of all means of production and
consequently also of all products; on the one hand it takes place between each
economic commune and its individual members, and on the other between the
various economic and trading communes themselves. “The individual
economic communes in particular will replace retail trade within their own
areas by completely planned sales” {326}. Wholesale trade will be
organised on the same lines: “The system of the free economic society ...
consequently remains a vast exchange institution, whose operations are carried
out on the basis provided by the precious metals. It is insight into the
inevitable necessity of this fundamental quality which distinguishes our scheme
from all those foggy notions which cling even to the most rational forms of
current socialist ideas” {324}. <a id="118"></a></p>
<p>For the purposes of this exchange, the economic commune, as the first
appropriator of the social products, has to determine, “for each type of
articles, a uniform price” {277}, based on the average production costs.
“The significance which the so-called costs of production ... have for
value and price today, will be provided” (in the socialitarian system)
“...by the estimates of the quantity of labour to be employed. These
estimates, by virtue of the principle of equal rights for each individual also
in the economic sphere, can be traced back, in the last analysis, to
consideration of the number of persons that participated in the labour; they
will result in the relation of prices corresponding both to the natural
conditions of production and to the social right of realisation. The output of
the precious metals will continue, as now, to determine the value of money...
It can be seen from this that in the changed constitution of society, one not
only does not lose the determining factor and measure, in the first place of
values, and, with value, of the exchange relations between products, but wins
them good and proper for the first time” {326-327}. <a id="119"></a></p>
<p class="fst">The famous “absolute value” {D. K. G. 499} is at
last realised. <a id="120"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">On the other hand, however, the commune must also put its
individual members in a position to buy from it the articles produced, by
paying to each, in compensation for his labour, a certain sum of money, daily,
weekly or monthly, but necessarily the same for all. “From the
socialitarian standpoint it is consequently a matter of indifference whether we
say that wages disappear, or, that they must become the exclusive form of
economic income” {D. C. 263}. Equal wages and equal prices, however,
establish “quantitative, if not qualitative equality of
consumption” {268}, and thereby the “universal principle of
justice” {282} is realised in the economic sphere. <a id="121"></a></p>
<p class="fst">As to how the level of this wage of the future is to be
determined, Herr Dühring tells us only</p>
<p class="quoted">that here too, as in all other cases, there will be an
exchange of “equal labour for equal labour” {D. C. 257}. For six
hours of labour, therefore, a sum of money will be paid which also embodies in
itself six hours of labour. <a id="122"></a></p>
<p class="fst">Nevertheless, the “universal principle of justice”
must not in any way be confounded with that crude levelling down which makes
the bourgeois so indignantly oppose all communism, and especially the
spontaneous communism of the workers. It is by no means so inexorable as it
would like to appear. <a id="123"></a></p>
<p>The “equality in principle of economic rights does not exclude the
<i>voluntary</i> addition to what justice requires of an expression of
special recognition and honour... Society <i>honours itself</i> in conferring
distinction on the higher types of professional ability by <i>a moderate
additional allocation</i> for consumption” {267}. <a id="124"></a></p>
<p>And Herr Dühring, too, honours himself, when combining the innocence of a
dove with the subtleness of a serpent, <span class="context">[Matthew 10:16.
— <i>Ed</i>]</span> he displays such touching concern for the moderate
additional consumption of the Dührings of the future. <a id="125"></a></p>
<p>This will finally do away with the capitalist mode of distribution. For <a id="126"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“supposing under such conditions someone actually had a
surplus of private means at his disposal, he would not be able to find any use
for it as capital. No individual and no group would acquire it from him for
production, except by way of exchange or purchase, but neither would ever have
occasion to pay him interest or profit” {264-65}. Hence
“inheritance conforming to the principle of equality” {289} would
be permissible. It cannot be dispensed with, for “a certain form of
inheritance will always be a necessary accompaniment of the family
principle”. But even the right of inheritance “will not be able to
lead to any amassing of considerable wealth, as the building up of property ...
can never again aim at the creation of means of production and purely
rentiers’ existences” {291}. <a id="127"></a></p>
<p class="fst">And this fortunately completes the economic commune. Let us now
have a look at how it works. <a id="128"></a></p>
<p>We assume that all of Herr Dühring's preliminary conditions are completely
realised; we therefore take it for granted that the economic commune pays to
each of its members, for six hours of labour a day, a sum of money, say twelve
marks, in which likewise six hours of labour are embodied. We assume further
that prices exactly correspond to values, and therefore, on our assumptions,
cover only the costs of raw materials, the wear and tear of machinery, the
consumption of instruments of labour and the wages paid. An economic commune of
a hundred working members would then produce in a day commodities to the value
of twelve hundred marks; and in a year of 300 working-days, 360,000 marks. It
pays the same sum to its members, each of whom does as he likes with his share,
which is twelve marks a day or 3,600 marks a year. At the end of a year, and at
the end of a hundred years, the commune is no richer than it was at the
beginning. During this whole period it will never once be in a position to
provide even the moderate additional allocation for Herr Dühring’s
consumption, unless it cares to take it from its stock of means of production.
Accumulation is completely forgotten. Even worse: as accumulation is a social
necessity and the retention of money provides a convenient form of
accumulation, the organisation of the economic commune directly impels its
members to accumulate privately, and thereby leads it to its own destruction.
<a id="129"></a></p>
<p>How can this conflict in the nature of the economic commune be avoided? It
might take refuge in his beloved “taxes” {24}, the price surcharge,
and sell its annual production for 480,000 instead of 360,000. But as all other
economic communes are in the same position, and would therefore act in the same
way, each of them, in its exchanges with the others, would have to pay just as
much “taxes” as it pockets itself, and the “tribute”
{374} would thus have to fall on its own members alone. <a id="130"></a></p>
<p>Or the economic commune might settle the matter without more ado by paying
to each member, for six hours of labour, the product of less than six hours,
say, of four hours, of labour; that is to say, instead of twelve marks only
eight marks a day, leaving the prices of commodities, however, at their former
level. In this case it does directly and openly what it strived to do in a
hidden and indirect way in the former case: it forms Marxian surplus-value to
the amount of 120,000 marks annually, by paying its members, on outright
capitalist lines, less than the value of what they produce, while it sells them
commodities, which they can only buy from it, at their full value. The economic
commune can therefore secure a reserve fund only by revealing itself as an
“ennobled” truck system <a href="notes.html#n*13" target=_blank><sup class="enote">*13</sup></a> on the widest possible communist basis. <a id="131"></a></p>
<p>So have your choice: Either the economic commune exchanges “equal
labour for equal labour” {257}, and in this case it cannot accumulate a
fund for the maintenance and extension of production, but only the individual
members can do this; or it does form such a fund, but in this case it does not
exchange “equal labour for equal labour”. <a id="132"></a></p>
<p>Such is the content of exchange in the economic commune. What of its form?
The exchange is effected through the medium of metallic money, and Herr Dühring
is not a little proud of the “world-historic import” {D. C. 341} of
this reform. But in the trading between the commune and its members the money
is <i>not</i> money at all, it does not function in any way as money. It
serves as a mere labour certificate; to use Marx's phrase, it is “merely
evidence of the part taken by the individual in the common labour, and of his
right to a certain portion of the common produce destined for
consumption”, and in carrying out this function, it is “no more
‘money’ than a ticket for the theatre”. It can therefore be
replaced by any other token, just as Weitling replaces it by a
“ledger”, in which the labour-hours worked are entered on one side
and means of subsistence taken as compensation on the other. <a href="footnotes.html#n121" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[121]</sup></a> In a word, in the
trading of the economic commune with its members it functions merely as
Owen’s “labour money”, that “phantom” which Herr
Dühring looks down upon so disdainfully, but nevertheless is himself compelled
to introduce into his economics of the future. Whether the token which
certifies the measure of fulfilment of the “obligation to produce”,
and thus of the earned “right to consume” {320} is a scrap of
paper, a counter or a gold coin is absolutely of no consequence for
<i>this</i> purpose. For other purposes, however, it is by no means
immaterial, as we shall see. <a id="133"></a></p>
<p>If therefore, in the trading of an economic commune with its members,
metallic money does not function as money but as a disguised labour
certificate, it performs its money function even less in exchange between the
different economic communes. In this exchange, on the assumptions made by Herr
Dühring, metallic money is totally superfluous. In fact, mere book-keeping
would suffice, which would effect the exchange of products of equal labour for
products of equal labour far more simply if it used the natural measure of
labour-time, with the labour-hour as unit — than if it first converted
the labour-hours into money. The exchange is in reality simple exchange in
kind; all balances are easily and simply settled by drafts on other communes.
But should a commune really have a deficit in its dealings with other communes,
all “the gold existing in the universe” {D. Ph. 96},
“money by nature” {D. C. 39} though it be, could not save
this commune from the fate of having to make good this deficit by increasing
the quantity of its own labour, if it does not want to fall into a position of
dependence on other communes on account of its debt. But let the reader always
bear in mind that we are not ourselves constructing any edifice of the future;
we are merely accepting Herr Dühring’s assumptions and drawing the inevitable
conclusions from them. <a id="134"></a></p>
<p>Thus neither in exchange between the economic commune and its members nor in
exchange between the different communes can gold, which is “money by nature”,
get to realise this its nature. Nevertheless, Herr Dühring assigns to it the
function of money even in the “socialitarian” system. Hence, we must see if
there is any other field in which its money function can be exercised. And this
field exists. Herr Dühring gives everyone a right to “quantitatively equal
consumption” {268}, but he cannot compel anyone to exercise it. On the
contrary, he is proud that in the world he has created everyone can do what he
likes with his money. He therefore cannot prevent some from setting aside a
small money hoard, while others are unable to make ends meet on the wage paid
to them. He even makes this inevitable by explicitly recognising in the right
of inheritance that family property should be owned in common; whence comes
also the obligation of the parents to maintain their children. But this makes a
wide breach in quantitatively equal consumption. The bachelor lives like a
lord, happy and content with his eight or twelve marks a day, while the widower
with eight minor children finds it very difficult to manage on this sum. On the
other hand, by accepting money in payment without any question, the commune
leaves open the door to the possibility that this money may have been obtained
otherwise than by the individual’s own labour. <i>Non olet</i>. <a href="footnotes.html#n122" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[122]</sup></a> The commune does
not know where it comes from. But in this way all conditions are created
permitting metallic money, which hitherto played the role of a mere labour
certificate, to exercise its real money function. Both the Opportunity and the
motive are present, on the one hand to form a hoard, and on the other to run
into debt. The needy individual borrows from the individual who builds up a
hoard. The borrowed money, accepted by the commune in payment for means of
subsistence, once more becomes what it is in present-day society, the social
incarnation of human labour, the real measure of labour, the general medium of
circulation. All the “laws and administrative regulations” {323} in the world
are just as powerless against it as they are against the multiplication table
or the chemical composition of water. And as the builder of the hoard is in a
position to extort interest from people in need, usury is restored along with
metallic money functioning as money. <a id="135"></a></p>
<p>Up to this point we have only considered the effects of a retention of
metallic money within the field of operation of the Dühring economic commune.
But outside this field the rest of the world, the profligate world, meanwhile
carries on contentedly in the old accustomed way. On the world market gold and
silver remain <i>world money</i>, a general means of purchase and payment the
absolute social embodiment of wealth. And this property of the precious metal
gives the individual members of the economic communes a new motive to
accumulate a hoard, get rich, exact usury; the motive to manoeuvre freely and
independently with regard to the commune and beyond its borders, and to realise
on the world market the private wealth which they have accumulated. The usurers
are transformed into dealers in the medium of circulation, bankers, controllers
of the medium of circulation and of world money, and thus into controllers of
production, and thus into controllers of the means of production, even though
these may still for many years be registered nominally as the property of the
economic and trading communes. And so that hoarders and usurers, transformed
into bankers, become the masters also of the economic and trading communes
themselves. Herr Dühring’s “socialitarian system” is indeed quite fundamentally
different from the “hazy notions” {D. K. G. 498} of the other socialists. It
has no other purpose but the recreation of high finance, under whose control
and for whose pecuniary advantage it will labour valiantly — if it should
ever happen to be established and to hold together. Its one hope of salvation
would lie in the amassers of hoards preferring, by means of their world money,
to run away from the commune with all possible speed. <a id="136"></a></p>
<p>Ignorance of earlier socialist thought is so widespread in Germany that an
innocent youth might at this point raise the question whether, for example,
Owen’s labour-notes might not lead to a similar abuse. Although we are here not
concerned with developing the significance of these labour-notes, space should
be given to the following for the purpose of contrasting Dühring's
“comprehensive schematism” {D. C. 341} with Owen's “crude feeble and meagre
ideas” {D. K. G. 295, 296}: In the first place, such a misuse of Owen's
labour-notes would require their conversion into real money, while Herr Dühring
presupposes real money, though attempting to prohibit it from functioning
otherwise than as mere labour certificate. While in Owen’s scheme there would
have to be a real abuse, in Dühring’s scheme the immanent nature of money,
which is independent of human volition, would assert itself; the specific,
correct use of money would assert itself in spite of the misuse which Herr
Dühring tries to impose on it owing to his own ignorance of the nature of
money. Secondly, with Owen the labour-notes are only a transitional form to
complete community and free utilisation of the resources of society; and
incidentally at most also a means designed to make communism plausible to the
British public. If therefore any form of misuse should compel Owen's society to
do away with the labour-notes, the society would take a step forward towards
its goal, entering upon a more perfect stage of its development. But if the
Dühringian economic commune abolishes money, it at one blow destroys its
“world-historic import”, it puts an end to its peculiar beauty, ceases to be
the Dühring economic commune and sinks to the level of the befogged notions to
lift it from which Herr Dühring has devoted so much of the hard labour of his
rational fantasy. <a href="notes.html#n*14" target=_blank><sup class="enote">*14</sup></a> <a id="137"></a></p>
<p>What, then, is the source of all the strange errors and entanglements amid
which the Dühring economic commune meanders? Simply the fog which, in Herr
Dühring’s mind, envelops the concepts of value and money, and finally drives
him to attempt to discover the value of labour. But as Herr Dühring has not by
any means the monopoly of such fogginess for Germany, but on the contrary meets
with many competitors, we will “overcome our reluctance for a moment and
solve the knot” {497} which he has contrived to make here. <a id="138"></a></p>
<p>The only value known in economics is the value of commodities. What are
commodities? Products made in a society of more or less separate private
producers, and therefore in the first place private products. These private
products, however, become commodities only when they are made, not for
consumption by their producers, but for consumption by others, that is, for
social consumption; they enter into social consumption through exchange. The
private producers are therefore socially interconnected, constitute a society.
Their products, although the private products of each individual, are therefore
simultaneously but unintentionally and as it were involuntarily, also social
products. In what, then, consists the social character of these private
products? Evidently in two peculiarities: first, that they all satisfy some
human want, have a use-value not only for the producers but also for others,
and secondly, that although they are products of the most varied individual
labour, they are at the same time products of human labour as such, of general
human labour. In so far as they have a use-value also for other persons, they
can, generally speaking enter into exchange; in so far as general human labour,
the simple expenditure of human labour-power is incorporated in all of them,
they can be compared with each other in exchange, be assumed to be equal or
unequal, according to the quantity of this labour embodied in each. In two
equal products made individually, social conditions being equal, an unequal
quantity of individual labour may be contained, but always only an equal
quantity of general human labour. An unskilled smith may make five horseshoes
in the time a skilful smith makes ten. But society does not form value from the
accidental lack of skill of an individual, it recognises as general human
labour only labour of a normal average degree of skill at the particular time.
In exchange therefore, one of the five horseshoes made by the first smith has
no more value than one of the ten made by the other in an equal time.
Individual labour contains general human labour only in so far as it is
socially necessary. <a id="139"></a></p>
<p>Therefore when I say that a commodity has a particular value, I say (1) that
it is a socially useful product; (2) that it has been produced by a private
individual for private account, (3) that although a product of individual
labour, it is nevertheless at the same time and as it were unconsciously and
involuntarily, also a product of social labour and, be it noted, of a definite
quantity of this labour, ascertained in a social way, through exchange; (4) I
express this quantity not in labour itself, in so and so many labour-hours, but
<i>in another commodity</i>. If therefore I say that this clock is worth as
much as that piece of cloth and each of them is worth fifty marks, I say that
an equal quantity of social labour is contained in the clock, the cloth and the
money. I therefore assert that the social labour-time represented in them has
been socially measured and found to be equal. But not directly, absolutely, as
labour-time is usually measured, in labour-hours or days, etc., but in a
roundabout way, through the medium of exchange, relatively. That is why I
cannot express this definite quantity of labour-time in labour-hours —
how many of them remains unknown to me — but also only in a roundabout
way, relatively, in another commodity, which represents an equal quantity of
social labourtime. The clock is worth as much as the piece of cloth. <a id="140"></a></p>
<p>But the production and exchange of commodities, while compelling the society
based on them to take this roundabout way, likewise compel it to make the
detour as short as possible. They single out from the commonalty of commodities
one sovereign commodity in which the value of all other commodities can be
expressed once and for all; a commodity which serves as the direct incarnation
of social labour, and is therefore directly and unconditionally exchangeable
for all commodities — money. Money is already contained in embryo in the
concept of value; it is value, only in developed form. But since the value of
commodities, as opposed to the commodities themselves, assumes independent
existence in money, a new factor appears in the society which produces and
exchanges commodities, a factor with new social functions and effects. We need
only state this point at the moment, without going more closely into it. <a id="141"></a></p>
<p>The political economy of commodity production is by no means the only
science which has to deal with factors known only relatively. The same is true
of physics, where we do not know how many separate gas molecules are contained
in a given volume of gas, pressure and temperature being also given. But we
know that, so far as Boyle’s law is correct, such a given volume of any gas
contains as many molecules as an equal volume of any other gas at the same
pressure and temperature. We can therefore compare the molecular content of the
most diverse volumes of the most diverse gases under the most diverse
conditions of pressure and temperature; and if we take as the unit one litre of
gas at 0° C and 760 mm pressure, we can measure the above molecular content by
this unit. — In chemistry the absolute atomic weights of the various
elements are also not known to us. But we know them relatively, inasmuch as we
know their reciprocal relations. Hence, just as commodity production and its
economics obtain a relative expression for the unknown quantities of labour
contained in the various commodities, by comparing these commodities on the
basis of their relative labour content, so chemistry obtains a relative
expression for the magnitude of the atomic weights unknown to it by comparing
the various elements on the basis of their atomic weights, expressing the
atomic weight of one element in multiples or fractions of the other (sulphur,
oxygen, hydrogen). And just as commodity production elevates gold to the level
of the absolute commodity, the general equivalent of all other commodities, the
measure of all values, so chemistry promotes hydrogen to the rank of the
chemical money commodity, by fixing its atomic weight at 1 and reducing the
atomic weights of all other elements to hydrogen, expressing them in multiples
of its atomic weight. <a id="142"></a></p>
<p>Commodity production, however, is by no means the only form of social
production. In the ancient Indian communities and in the family communities of
the southern Slavs, products are not transformed into commodities. The members
of the community are directly associated for production; the work is
distributed according to tradition and requirements, and likewise the products
to the extent that they are destined for consumption. Direct social production
and direct distribution preclude all exchange of commodities, therefore also
the transformation of the products into commodities (at any rate within the
community) and consequently also their transformation into <i>values.</i> <a id="143"></a></p>
<p>From the moment when society enters into possession of the means of
production and uses them in direct association for production, the labour of
each individual, however varied its specifically useful character may be,
becomes at the start and directly social labour. The quantity of social labour
contained in a product need not then be established in a roundabout way; daily
experience shows in a direct way how much of it is required on the average.
Society can simply calculate how many hours of labour are contained in a
steam-engine, a bushel of wheat of the last harvest, or a hundred square yards
of cloth of a certain quality. It could therefore never occur to it still to
express the quantities of labour put into the products, quantities which it
will then know directly and in their absolute amounts, in a third product, in a
measure which, besides, is only relative, fluctuating, inadequate, though
formerly unavoidable for lack of a better one, rather than express them in
their natural, adequate and absolute measure, <i>time.</i> Just as little as
it would occur to chemical science still to express atomic weight in a
roundabout way, relatively, by means of the hydrogen atom, if it were able to
express them absolutely, in their adequate measure, namely in actual weights,
in billionths or quadrillionths of a gramme. Hence, on the assumptions we made
above, society will not assign values to products. It will not express the
simple fact that the hundred square yards of cloth have required for their
production, say, a thousand hours of labour in the oblique and meaningless way,
stating that they have the <i>value</i> of a thousand hours of labour. It is
true that even then it will still be necessary for society to know how much
labour each article of consumption requires for its production. It will have to
arrange its plan of production in accordance with its means of production,
which include, in particular, its labour-powers. The useful effects of the
various articles of consumption, compared with one another and with the
quantities of labour required for their production, will in the end determine
the plan. People will be able to manage everything very simply, without the
intervention of much-vaunted “value”. <a href="notes.html#n*15" target=_blank><sup class="enote">*15</sup></a> <a id="144"></a></p>
<p>The concept of value is the most general and therefore the most
comprehensive expression of the economic conditions of commodity production.
Consequently, this concept contains the germ, not only of money, but also of
all the more developed forms of the production and exchange of commodities. The
fact that value is the expression of the social labour contained in the
privately produced products itself creates the possibility of a difference
arising between this social labour and the private labour contained in these
same products. If therefore a private producer continues to produce in the old
way, while the social mode of production develops this difference will become
palpably evident to him. The same result follows when the aggregate of private
producers of a particular class of goods produces a quantity of them which
exceeds the requirements of society. The fact that the value of a commodity is
expressed only in terms of another commodity, and can only be realised in
exchange for it, admits of the possibility that the exchange may never take
place altogether, or at least may not realise the correct value. Finally, when
the specific commodity labour-power appears on the market, its value is
determined, like that of any other commodity, by the labour-time socially
necessary for its production. The value form of products therefore already
contains in embryo the whole capitalist form of production, the antagonism
between capitalists and wage-workers, the industrial reserve army, crises. To
seek to abolish the capitalist form of production by establishing "true value"
{D. K. G. 78} is therefore tantamount to attempting to abolish Catholicism by
establishing the "true" Pope, or to set up a society in which at last the
producers control their product, by consistently carrying into life an economic
category which is the most comprehensive expression of the enslavement of the
producers by their own product. <a id="145"></a></p>
<p>Once the commodity-producing society has further developed the value form,
which is inherent in commodities as such, to the money form, various germs
still hidden in value break through to the light of day. The first and most
essential effect is the generalisation of the commodity form. Money forces the
commodity form even on the objects which have hitherto been produced directly
for self-consumption; it drags them into exchange. Thereby the commodity form
and money penetrate the internal husbandry of the communities directly
associated for production; they break one tie of communion after another, and
dissolve the community into a mass of private producers. At first, as can be
seen in India, money replaces joint tillage of the soil by individual tillage;
at a later stage it puts an end to the common ownership of the tillage area,
which still manifests itself in periodical redistribution, by a final division
(for example in the village communities on the Mosel; and it is now beginning
also in the Russian village communes); finally, it forces the dividing-up of
whatever woodland and pasturage is still owned in common. Whatever other causes
arising in the development of production are also operating here, money always
remains the most powerful means through which their influence is exerted on the
communities. And, despite all “laws and administrative regulations” {D. C.
323}, money would with the same natural necessity inevitably break up the
Dühring economic commune, if it ever came into existence. <a id="146"></a></p>
<p>We have already seen above (“Political Economy”, VI) that it is a
contradiction in itself to speak of the value of labour. As under certain
social relations labour produces not only products but also value, and this
value is measured by labour, the latter can as little have a separate value as
weight, as such, can have a separate weight, or heat, a separate temperature.
But it is the characteristic peculiarity of all social confusion that ruminates
on "true value" {D. K. G. 78} to imagine that in existing society the worker
does not receive the full "value" of his labour, and that socialism is destined
to remedy this. Hence it is necessary in the first place to discover what the
value of labour is, and this is done by attempting to measure labour, not by
its adequate measure, time, but by its product. The worker should receive the
"full proceeds of labour" {D. C. 324}. <a href="footnotes.html#n124" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[124]</sup></a> Not only the labour product, but labour itself
should be directly exchangeable for products one hour’s labour for the product
of another hour's labour. This however, gives rise at once to a very “serious”
hitch. The <i>whole product is</i> distributed. The most important
progressive function of society, accumulation, is taken from society and put
into the hands, placed at the arbitrary discretion, of individuals. The
individuals can do what they like with their “proceeds”, but society at best
remains as rich or poor as it was. The means of production accumulated in the
past have therefore been centralised in the hands of society only in order that
all means of production accumulated in the future may once again be dispersed
in the hands of individuals. One knocks to pieces one’s own premises; one has
arrived at a pure absurdity. <a id="147"></a></p>
<p>Fluid labour, active labour-power, is to be exchanged for the product of
labour. Then labour-power is a commodity, just like the product for which it is
to be exchanged. Then the value of this labour-power is not in any sense
determined by its product, but by the social labour embodied in it, according
to the present law of wages. <a id="148"></a></p>
<p>But it is precisely this which must not be, we are told. Fluid labour,
labour-power, should be exchangeable for its full product. That is to say, it
should be exchangeable not for its <i>value</i>, but for its
<i>use-value;</i> the law of value is to apply to all other commodities, but
must be repealed so far as labour-power is concerned. Such is the
self-destructive confusion that lies behind the “value of labour”. <a id="149"></a></p>
<p>The “exchange of labour for labour on the principle of equal valuation”
{256}, in so far as it has any meaning, that is to say, the mutual
exchangeability of products of equal social labour, hence the law of value, is
the fundamental law of precisely commodity production, hence also of its
highest form, capitalist production. It asserts itself in present-day society
in the only way in which economic laws can assert themselves in a society of
private producers: as a blindly operating law of nature inherent in things and
relations, and independent of the will or actions of the producers. By
elevating this law to the basic law of his economic commune and demanding that
the commune should execute it in all consciousness, Herr Dühring converts the
basic law of existing society into the basic law of his imaginary society. He
wants existing society, but without its abuses. In this he occupies the same
position as Proudhon. Like him, he wants to abolish the abuses which have
arisen out of the development of commodity production into capitalist
production, by giving effect against them to the basic law of commodity
production, precisely the law to whose operation these abuses are due. Like
him, he wants to abolish the real consequences of the law of value by means of
fantastic ones. <a id="150"></a></p>
<p>Our modern Don Quixote, seated on his noble Rosinante, the “universal
principle of justice” {D. C. 282}, and followed by his valiant Sancho Panza,
Abraham Enss, sets out proudly on his knight errantry to win Mambrin's helmet,
the “value of labour”; but we fear, fear greatly, he will bring home nothing
but the old familiar barber’s basin. <a id="151"></a></p>

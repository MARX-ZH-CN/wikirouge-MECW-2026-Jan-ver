<h1>VI. Philosophy of Nature.<br>
Cosmogony, Physics, Chemistry</h1>
<a id="188"></a>
<p class="fst">Passing on, we come now to the theories concerning the manner in
which the present world came into existence.</p>
<a id="189"></a>
<p class="quoted">A state of universal dispersion of matter, we are told, was
the point of departure of the ionic philosophers, but later, particularly from
the time of Kant, the assumption of a primordial nebula played a new role,
gravitation and the radiation of heat having been instrumental in the gradual
formation of separate solid celestial bodies. The contemporary mechanical
theory of heat makes it possible to deduce the earlier states of the universe
in a far more definite form. However, “the state of gaseous dispersion
can be a starting-point for serious deductions only when it is possible to
characterise beforehand more definitely the mechanical system existing in it.
Otherwise not only does the idea in fact remain extremely nebulous, but also
the original nebula, as the deductions progress, really becomes ever thicker
and more impenetrable; ... meanwhile it all still remains in the vagueness and
formlessness of an idea of diffusion that cannot be more closely
determined”, and so “this gaseous universe” provides us with
“only an extremely airy conception” {D. Ph. 85-87}.</p>
<a id="190"></a>
<p class="fst">The Kantian theory of the origin of all existing celestial
bodies from rotating nebular masses was the greatest advance made by astronomy
since Copernicus. For the first time the conception that nature had no history
in time began to be shaken. Until then the celestial bodies were believed to
have been always, from the very beginning, in the same states and always to
have followed the same courses; and even though individual organisms on the
various celestial bodies died out, nevertheless genera and species were held to
be immutable. It is true that nature was obviously in constant motion, but this
motion appeared as an incessant repetition of the same processes. Kant made the
first breach in this conception, which corresponded exactly to the metaphysical
mode of thought, and he did it in such a scientific way that most of the proofs
furnished by him still hold good today. At the same time, the Kantian theory is
still, strictly considered, only a hypothesis. But the Copernican world system,
too, is still no more than this, <a href="footnotes.html#n38" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[38]</sup></a> and since the spectroscopic proof of the existence
of such red-hot gaseous masses in the starry heavens, proof that brooks no
contradiction, the scientific opposition to Kant ’s theory has been
silenced. Even Herr Dühring cannot complete his construction of the world
without such a nebular stage, but takes his revenge for this by demanding to be
shown the mechanical system existing in this nebular stage, and because no one
can show him this, he applies all kinds of depreciatory epithets to this
nebular stage of the universe. Contemporary science unfortunately cannot
describe this system to Herr Dühring ’s satisfaction. Just as little is
it able to answer many other questions. To the question: Why do toads have no
tails? — up to now it has only been able to answer: Because they have
lost them. But should anyone get excited over that and say that this is to
leave the whole question in the vagueness and formlessness of an idea of loss
which cannot be determined more closely, and that it is an extremely airy
conception, such an application of morality to natural science does not take us
one step further. Such expressions of dislike and bad temper can be used always
and everywhere, and just for that reason they should never be used anywhere.
After all, who is stopping Herr Dühring from himself discovering the mechanical
system of the primordial nebula?</p>
<a id="191"></a>
<p>Fortunately we now learn that</p>
<a id="192"></a>
<p class="quoted">the Kantian nebular mass “is far from coinciding with a
completely identical state of the world medium, or, to put it another way, with
the self-equal state of matter” {D. Ph. 87}.</p>
<a id="193"></a>
<p class="fst">It was really fortunate for Kant that he was able to content
himself with going back from the existing celestial bodies to the nebular ball,
and did not even dream of the self-equal state of matter! It may be remarked in
passing that when contemporary natural science describes the Kantian nebular
ball as primordial nebula, this, it goes without saying, is only to be
understood in a relative sense. It is primordial nebula, on the one hand, in
that it is the origin of the existing celestial bodies, and on the other hand
because it is the earliest form of matter which we have up to now been able to
work back to. This certainly does not exclude but rather implies the
supposition that before the nebular stage matter passed through an infinite
series of other forms.</p>
<a id="194"></a>
<p>Herr Dühring sees his advantage here. Where we, with science, stand still
for the time being at what for the time being is deemed primordial nebula, his
science of sciences helps him much further back to that</p>
<a id="195"></a>
<p class="quoted">“state of the world medium which cannot be understood
either as purely static in the present meaning of the idea, or as
dynamic” {87} — </p>
<a id="196"></a>
<p class="fst">which therefore cannot be understood at all.</p>
<a id="197"></a>
<p class="quoted">“The unity of matter and mechanical force which we call
the world medium is what might be termed a logical-real formula for indicating
the self-equal state of matter as the prerequisite of all innumerable stages of
evolution” {87-88}.</p>
<a id="198"></a>
<p class="fst">We are clearly not by a long shot rid of the self-equal
primordial state of matter. Here it is spoken of as the unity of matter and
mechanical force, and this as a logical-real formula, etc. Hence, as soon as
the unity of matter and mechanical force comes to an end, motion begins.</p>
<a id="199"></a>
<p>The logical-real formula is nothing but a lame attempt to make the Hegelian
categories “in itself ” <span class="context">[An sich]</span> and
"for itself" <span class="context">[Für sich]</span> usable in the philosophy
of reality. With Hegel, “in itself ” covers the original identity
of the hidden, undeveloped contradictions within a thing, a process or an idea,
and “for itself ” contains the distinction and separation of these
hidden elements and the starting-point of their conflict. We are therefore to
think of the motionless primordial state as the unity of matter and mechanical
force, and of the transition to movement as their separation and opposition.
What we have gained by this is not any proof of the reality of that fantastic
primordial state, but only the fact that it is possible to bring this state
under the Hegelian category of “in itself”, and its equally
fantastic termination under the category of “for itself”. Hegel
help us!</p>
<a id="200"></a>
<p>Matter, Herr Dühring says, is the bearer of all reality; accordingly, there
can be no mechanical force apart from matter. Mechanical force is furthermore a
state of matter {See D. Ph. 73}. In the original state, when nothing happened,
matter and its state, mechanical force, were one. Afterwards, when something
began to happen, this state must apparently have become different from matter.
So we are to let ourselves be dismissed with these mystical phrases and with
the assurance that the self-equal state was neither static nor dynamic, neither
in equilibrium nor in motion. We still do not know where mechanical force was
in that state, and how we are to get from absolute immobility to motion without
an impulse from outside, that is, without God.</p>
<a id="201"></a>
<p>The materialists before Herr Dühring spoke of matter and motion. He reduces
motion to mechanical force as its supposed basic form, and thereby makes it
impossible for himself to understand the real connection between matter and
motion, which moreover was also unclear to all former materialists. And yet it
is simple enough. <i>Motion is the mode of existence of matter.</i> Never
anywhere has there been matter without motion, nor can there be. Motion in
cosmic space, mechanical motion of smaller masses on the various celestial
bodies, the vibration of molecules as heat or as electrical or magnetic
currents, chemical disintegration and combination, organic life — at each
given moment each individual atom of matter in the world is in one or other of
these forms of motion, or in several forms at once. All rest, all equilibrium,
is only relative, only has meaning in relation to one or other definite form of
motion. On the earth, for example, a body may be in mechanical equilibrium, may
be mechanically at rest; but this in no way prevents it from participating in
the motion of the earth and in that of the whole solar system, just as little
as it prevents its most minute physical particles from carrying out the
vibrations determined by its temperature, or its atoms from passing through a
chemical process. Matter without motion is just as inconceivable as motion
without matter. Motion is therefore as uncreatable and indestructible as matter
itself; as the older philosophy (Descartes) expressed it, the quantity of
motion existing in the world is always the same. Motion therefore cannot be
created; it can only be transferred. When motion is transferred from one body
to another, it may be regarded, in so far as it transfers itself, is active, as
the- cause of motion, in so far as the latter is transferred, is passive. We
call this active motion <i>force</i>, and the passive, the <i>manifestation
of force.</i> Hence it is as clear as daylight that a force is as great as its
manifestation, because in fact the <i>same</i> motion takes place in both.</p>
<a id="202"></a>
<p>A motionless state of matter is therefore one of the most empty and
nonsensical of ideas — a <span class="duhring">“delirious fantasy
”</span> of the purest water. In order to arrive at such an idea it is
necessary to conceive the relative mechanical equilibrium, a state in which a
body on the earth may be, as absolute rest, and then to extend this equilibrium
over the whole universe. This is certainly made easier if universal motion is
reduced to purely mechanical force. And the restriction of motion to purely
mechanical force has the further advantage that a force can be conceived as at
rest, as tied up, and therefore for the moment inoperative. For if, as is very
often the case, the transfer of a motion is a somewhat complex process
containing a number of intermediate links, it is possible to postpone the
actual transmission to any moment desired by omitting the last link in the
chain. This is the case, for instance, if a man loads a gun and postpones the
moment when, by the pulling of the trigger, the discharge, the transfer of the
motion set free by the combustion of the powder, takes place. It is therefore
possible to imagine that during its motionless, self-equal state, matter was
loaded with force, and this, if anything at all, seems to be what Herr Dühring
understands by the unity of matter and mechanical force. This conception is
nonsensical, because it transfers to the entire universe a state as absolute,
which by its nature is relative and therefore can only affect <i>a part</i>
of matter at any one time. Even if we overlook this point, the difficulty still
remains: first, how did the world come to be loaded, since nowadays guns do not
load themselves; and second, whose finger was it then that pulled the trigger?
We may turn and twist as much as we like, but under Herr Dühring's guidance we
always come back again to — the finger of God.</p>
<a id="203"></a>
<p>From astronomy our philosopher of reality passes on to mechanics and
physics, and voices the lament that the mechanical theory of heat has not, in
the generation since its discovery, been materially advanced beyond the point
to which Robert Mayer had himself developed it, bit by bit. Apart from this,
the whole business is still very obscure;</p>
<a id="204"></a>
<p class="quoted">we must “always remember that in the states of motion
of matter, static relations are also present, and that these latter are not
measurable by the mechanical work ... if previously we described nature as a
great worker, and if we now construe this expression strictly, we must
furthermore add that the self-equal states and static relations do not
represent mechanical work. So once again we miss the bridge from the static to
the dynamic, and if so-called latent heat has up to now remained a
stumbling-block for the theory, we must recognise a defect in this too, which
can least be denied in its cosmic applications” {D. Ph. 90}.</p>
<a id="205"></a>
<p class="fst">This whole oracular discourse is once again nothing but the
outpouring of a bad conscience, which is very well aware that with its creation
of motion out of absolute immobility it got irretrievably stuck in the mud, but
is nevertheless ashamed to appeal to the only possible saviour, namely, the
creator of heaven and earth. If the bridge from the static to the dynamic, from
equilibrium to motion, cannot be found even in mechanics, including the
mechanics of heat, under what obligations is Herr Dühring to find the bridge
from his motionless state to motion? That would be a fortunate way for him to
get out of his plight.</p>
<a id="206"></a>
<p>In ordinary mechanics the bridge from the static to the dynamic is —
the external impulse. If a stone weighing a hundredweight is raised from the
ground ten yards into the air and is freely suspended in such a way that it
remains hanging there in a self-equal state and in a condition of rest, it
would be necessary to have an audience of sucklings to be able to maintain that
the present position of this body does not represent any mechanical work, or
that its distance from its previous position is not measurable by mechanical
work. Any passer-by will easily explain to Herr Dühring that the stone did not
rise of itself to the rope and any manual of mechanics will tell him that if he
lets the stone fall again it performs in falling just as much mechanical work
as was necessary to raise it the ten yards in the air. Even the simple fact
that the stone is hanging up there represents mechanical work, for if it
remains hanging long enough the rope breaks, as soon as chemical decomposition
makes it no longer strong enough to bear the weight of the stone. But it is to
such simple basic forms, to use Herr Dühring's language, that all mechanical
processes can be reduced, and the engineer is still to be born who cannot find
the bridge from the static to the dynamic, so long as he has at his disposal a
sufficient external impulse.</p>
<a id="207"></a>
<p>To be sure, it is a hard nut and a bitter pill for our metaphysician that
motion should find its measure in its opposite, in rest. That is indeed a
crying contradiction, and every <i>contradiction</i>, according to Herr
Dühring, is <i>nonsense</i> {D. Ph. 30}. It is none the less a fact that a
suspended stone represents a definite quantity of mechanical motion, which is
measurable exactly by the stone's weight and its distance from the ground, and
may be used in various ways at will, for example, by its direct fall, by
sliding down an inclined plane, or by turning a shaft. The same is true of a
loaded gun. From the dialectical standpoint, the possibility of expressing
motion in its opposite, in rest, presents absolutely no difficulty. From the
dialectical standpoint the whole antithesis, as we have seen, is only relative;
there is no such thing as absolute rest, unconditional equilibrium. Each
separate movement strives towards equilibrium, and the motion as a whole puts
an end again to the equilibrium. When therefore rest and equilibrium occur they
are the result of limited motion, and it is self-evident that this motion is
measurable by its result, can be expressed in it, and can be restored out of it
again in one form or another. But Herr Dühring cannot allow himself to be
satisfied with such a simple presentation of the matter. As a good
metaphysician he first tears open, between motion and equilibrium, a yawning
gulf which does not exist in reality and is then surprised that he cannot find
any bridge across this self-fabricated gulf. He might just as well mount his
metaphysical Rosinante <span class="context">[Don Quixote’s horse]</span>
and chase the Kantian “thing-in-itself”; for it is that and nothing
else which in the last analysis is hiding behind this undiscoverable bridge.</p>
<a id="208"></a>
<p>But what about the mechanical theory of heat and the tied-up or latent heat
which “has remained a stumbling-block” for this theory?</p>
<a id="209"></a>
<p>If, under normal atmospheric pressure, a pound of ice at the temperature of
the freezing point is transformed by heat into a pound of water of the same
temperature, a quantity of heat disappears which would be sufficient to warm
the same pound of water from 0° to 79.4° C, or to raise the temperature of 79.4
pounds of water by one degree. If this pound of water is heated to boiling
point, that is, to 100° C, and is then transformed into steam of 100° C, the
amount of heat that disappears, by the time the last of the water has changed
into steam, is almost seven times greater, sufficient to raise the temperature
of 537.2 pounds of water by one degree. The heat that disappears is called
<i>tied-up.</i> If, by cooling, the steam is again transformed into water,
and the water, in its turn, into ice, the same quantity of heat as was
previously tied up is now again set <i>free</i>, i.e., can be felt and
measured as heat. This setting free of heat on the condensation of steam and
the freezing of water is the reason why steam, when cooled to 100°, is only
gradually transformed into water, and why a mass of water of freezing point
temperature is only very gradually transformed into ice. These are the facts.
The question is, what happens to the heat while it is tied up?</p>
<a id="210"></a>
<p>The mechanical theory of heat, according to which heat consists in a greater
or lesser vibration, depending on the temperature and state of aggregation, of
the smallest physically active particles (molecules) of a body — a
vibration which under certain conditions can change into any other form of
motion — explains that the heat that has disappeared has done work, has
been transformed into work. When ice melts, the close and firm connection
between the individual molecules is broken, and transformed into a loose
juxtaposition; when water at boiling point becomes steam a state is reached in
which the individual molecules no longer have any noticeable influence on one
another, and under the influence of heat even fly apart in all directions. It
is clear that the single molecules of a body are endowed with far greater
energy in the gaseous state than they are in the fluid state, and in the fluid
state again more than in the solid state. The tied-up heat, therefore, has not
disappeared; it has merely been transformed, and has assumed the form of
molecular tension. As soon as the condition under which the separate molecules
are able to maintain their absolute or relative freedom in regard to one
another ceases to exist — that is, as soon as the temperature falls below
the minimum of 100° or 0°, as the case may be, this tension relaxes, the
molecules again press towards each other with the same force with which they
had previously flown apart; and this force disappears, but only to reappear as
heat, and as precisely the same quantity of heat as had previously been tied
up. This explanation is of course a hypothesis, as is the whole mechanical
theory of heat, inasmuch as no one has up to now ever seen a molecule, not to
mention one in vibration. Just for this reason it is certain to be full of
defects as this still very young theory is as a whole, but it can at least
explain what happens without in any way coming into conflict with the
indestructibility and uncreatability of motion, and it is even able to account
for the whereabouts of heat during its transformations. Latent, or tied-up,
heat is therefore in no way a stumbling-block for the mechanical theory of
heat. On the contrary, this theory provides the first rational explanation of
what takes place, and it involves no stumbling-block except in so far as
physicists continue to describe heat which has been transformed into another
form of molecular energy by means of the term “tied-up”, which has
become obsolete and unsuitable.</p>
<a id="211"></a>
<p>The self-equal states and conditions of rest in the solid, in the liquid and
in the gaseous state of aggregation therefore represent, to be sure, mechanical
work, in so far as mechanical work is the measure of heat. Both the solid crust
of the earth and the water of the ocean, in their present aggregate states,
represent a definite quantity of heat set free, to which of course corresponds
an equally definite quantity of mechanical force. In the transition of the
gaseous ball, from which the earth has developed, into the liquid and
subsequently into the largely solid aggregate state, a definite quantity of
molecular energy was radiated as heat into space. The difficulty about which
Herr Dühring mumbles in his mysterious manner therefore does not exist, and
though even in applying the theory cosmically we may come up against defects
and gaps — which must be attributed to our imperfect means of knowledge
— we nowhere come up against theoretically insuperable obstacles. The
bridge from the static to the dynamic is here, too, the external impulse
— the cooling or heating brought about by other bodies acting on an
object which is in a state of equilibrium. The further we explore this natural
philosophy of Dühring's, the more impossible appear all attempts to explain
motion out of immobility or to find the bridge over which the purely static,
the resting, can by <i>itself</i> pass to the dynamic, to motion.</p>
<a id="212"></a>
<p>With this we have fortunately rid ourselves for a time of the self-equal
primordial state. Herr Dühring passes on to chemistry, and takes the
opportunity to reveal to us three laws of nature's inertness which have so far
been discovered by his philosophy of reality, viz.:</p>
<a id="213"></a>
<p class="quoted">(1) the quantity of all matter in general, (2) that of the
simple (chemical) elements, and (3) that of mechanical force are constant {D.
Ph. 97}</p>
<a id="214"></a>
<p class="fst">Hence: the uncreatability and indestructibility of matter, and
also of its simple component parts, in so far as it is made up of such, as well
as the uncreatability and indestructibility of motion — these old facts
known the world over and expressed most inadequately — is the only
positive thing which Herr Dühring can provide us with as a result of his
natural philosophy of the inorganic world. We knew all this long ago. But what
we did not know was that they were “laws of inertness” and as such
“schematic properties of the system of things”. We are witnessing a
repetition of what happened above to Kant: Herr Dühring picks up some old
familiar quip, sticks a Dühring label on it, and calls the result:</p>
<a id="215"></a>
<p class="quoted">“from the ground up original conclusions and views ...
system-creating ideas {525} deep-rooted science” {200, 219; D. C.
555-56}.</p>
<a id="216"></a>
<p class="fst">But the need not by any means despair on this account. Whatever
defects even the most deep-rooted science and the best-ordered society may
have, Herr Dühring can at any rate assert one thing with confidence:</p>
<a id="217"></a>
<p class="quoted">“The amount of gold existing in the universe must at
all times have been the same, and it can have increased or diminished just as
little as can matter in general” {D. Ph. 96}.</p>
<a id="218"></a>
<p class="fst">Unfortunately Herr Dühring does not tell us what we can buy with
this “existing gold”.</p>

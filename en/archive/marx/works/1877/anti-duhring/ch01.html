<h1>Part I: Philosophy</h1>

<h1>III. Classification.<br>
Apriorism</h1>
<a id="082"></a>
<p class="quoted">Philosophy, according to Herr Dühring, is the development of
the highest form of consciousness of the world and of life {D. Ph. 2},and in a
wider sense embraces the <i>principles</i> of all knowledge and volition.
Wherever a series of cognitions or stimuli or a group of forms of being come to
be examined by human consciousness, the <i>principles</i> underlying these
manifestations of necessity become an object of philosophy. These principles
are the simple, or until now assumed to be simple, constituents of manifold
knowledge and volition {8}. Like the chemical composition of bodies, the
general constitution of things can be reduced to basic forms and basic
elements. These ultimate constituents or principles, once they have been
discovered, are valid not only for what is immediately known and accessible,
but also for the world which is unknown and inaccessible to us. Philosophical
principles consequently provide the final supplement required by the sciences
in order to become a uniform system by which nature and human life can be
explained {9}. Apart from the fundamental forms of all existence, philosophy
has only two specific subjects of investigation — nature and the world of
man {14}. Accordingly, our material arranges itself <i>quite naturally</i>
into three groups, namely, the general scheme of the universe, the science of
the principles of nature, and finally the science of mankind. This succession
at the same time contains <i>an inner logical sequence</i>, for the formal
principles which are valid for all being take precedence, and the realms of the
objects to which they are <i>to be applied</i> then follow in the degree of
their subordination {15}.</p>
<a id="083"></a>
<p class="fst">So far Herr Dühring, and almost entirely word for word.</p>
<a id="084"></a>
<p>What he is dealing with are therefore <i>principles</i>, formal tenets
derived from <i>thought</i> and not from the external world, which are to be
applied to nature and the realm of man, and to which therefore nature and man
have to conform. But whence does thought obtain these principles? From itself?
No, for Herr Dühring himself says: <span class="duhring">the realm of pure
thought is limited to logical schemata and mathematical forms</span> {42} (the
latter, moreover, as we shall see, is wrong). Logical schemata can only relate
to <i>forms of thought;</i> but what we are dealing with here is solely forms
of <i>being</i>, of the external world, and these forms can never be created
and derived by thought out of itself, but only from the external world. But
with this the whole relationship is inverted: the principles are not the
starting-point of the investigation, but its final result; they are not applied
to nature and human history, but abstracted from them, it is not nature and the
realm of man which conform to these principles, but the principles are only
valid in so far as they are in conformity with nature and history. That is the
only materialist conception of the matter, and Herr Dühring's contrary
conception is idealistic, makes things stand completely on their heads, and
fashions the real world out of ideas, out of schemata, schemes or categories
existing somewhere before the world, from eternity — just like a
<i>Hegel</i>.</p>
<a id="085"></a>
<p>In fact, let us compare Hegel’s <i>Encyclopaedia</i> <a href="footnotes.html#n30" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[30]</sup></a> and all its
delirious fantasies with Herr Dühring»s final and ultimate truths. With Herr
Dühring we have in the first place general world schematism, which Hegel calls
<i>Logic.</i> Then with both of them we have the application of these
schemata or logical categories to nature: the philosophy of nature; and finally
their application to the realm of man, which Hegel calls the philosophy of
mind. The <span class="duhring">“inner logical sequence”</span> of
the Dühring succession therefore leads us <span class="duhring">“quite
naturally”</span> {D. Ph. 15} back to Hegel’s
<i>Encyclopaedia</i>, from which it has been taken with a loyalty which would
move that wandering Jew of the Hegelian school, Professor Michelet of Berlin,
to tears. <a href="footnotes.html#n31" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[31]</sup></a></p>
<a id="086"></a>
<p>That is what comes of accepting “consciousness”,
“thought”, quite naturalistically, as something given, something
opposed from the outset to being, to nature. If that were so, it must seem
extremely strange that consciousness and nature, thinking and being, the laws
of thought and the laws of nature, should correspond so closely. But if the
further question is raised what thought and consciousness really are and where
they come from, it becomes apparent that they are products of the human brain
and that man himself is a product of nature, which has developed in and along
with its environment; hence it is self-evident that the products of the human
brain, being in the last analysis also products of nature, do not contradict
the rest of nature's interconnections but are in correspondence with them. <a href="footnotes.html#n32" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[32]</sup></a></p>
<a id="087"></a>
<p>But Herr Dühring cannot permit himself such a simple treatment of the
subject. He thinks not only in the name of humanity — in itself no small
achievement — but in the name of the conscious and reasoning beings on
all celestial bodies. Indeed, it would be </p>
<a id="088"></a>
<p class="quoted">“a degradation of the basic forms of consciousness and
knowledge to attempt to rule out or even to put under suspicion their sovereign
validity and their unconditional claim to truth, by applying the epithet
‘human’ to them” {2}.</p>
<a id="089"></a>
<p class="fst">Hence, in order that no suspicion may arise that on some
celestial body or other twice two makes five {30-31}, Herr Dühring dare not
designate thought as being human, and so he has to sever it from the only real
foundation on which we find it, namely, man and nature; and with that he
tumbles hopelessly into an ideology <a href="footnotes.html#n33" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[33]</sup></a> which reveals him as the epigone of the
“epigone” Hegel {197}. By the way, we shall often meet Herr Dühring
again on other celestial bodies.</p>
<a id="090"></a>
<p>It goes without saying that no materialist doctrine can be founded on such
an ideological basis. Later on we shall see that Herr Dühring is forced more
than once to endow nature surreptitiously with conscious activity, with what in
plain language is called God.</p>
<a id="091"></a>
<p>However, our philosopher of reality had also other motives for shifting the
basis of all reality from the real world to the world of thought. The science
of this general world schematism, of these formal principles of being, is
precisely the foundation of Herr Dühring's philosophy. If we deduce world
schematism not from our minds, but only <i>through</i> our minds from the
real world, if we deduce principles of being from what is, we need no
philosophy for this purpose, but positive knowledge of the world and of what
happens in it; and what this yields is also not philosophy, but positive
science. In that case, however, Herr Dühring's whole volume would be nothing
but love's labour lost.</p>
<a id="092"></a>
<p>Further: if no philosophy as such is any longer required, then also there is
no more need of any system, not even of any natural system of philosophy. The
perception that all the processes of nature are systematically connected drives
science on to prove this systematic connection throughout, both in general and
in particular. But an adequate, exhaustive scientific exposition of this
interconnection, the formation of an exact mental image of the world system in
which we live, is impossible for us, and will always remain impossible. If at
any time in the development of mankind such a final, conclusive system of the
interconnections within the world — physical as well as mental and
historical — were brought about, this would mean that human knowledge had
reached its limit, and, from the moment when society had been brought into
accord with that system, further historical development would be cut short
— which would be an absurd idea, sheer nonsense. Mankind therefore finds
itself faced with a contradiction: on the one hand, it has to gain an
exhaustive knowledge of the world system in all its interrelations; and on the
other hand, because of the nature both of men and of the world system, this
task can never be completely fulfilled. But this contradiction lies not only in
the nature of the two factors — the world, and man — it is also the
main lever of all intellectual advance, and finds its solution continuously,
day by day, in the endless progressive development of humanity, just as for
example mathematical problems find their solution in an infinite series or
continued fractions. Each mental image of the world system is and remains in
actual fact limited, objectively by the historical conditions and subjectively
by the physical and mental constitution of its originator. But Herr Dühring
explains in advance that his mode of reasoning is such that it excludes any
tendency to a subjectively limited conception of the world. We saw above that
he was omnipresent — on all possible celestial bodies. We now see that he
is also omniscient. He has solved the ultimate problems of science and thus
nailed boards across the future of all science.</p>
<a id="093"></a>
<p>As with the basic forms of being, so also with the whole of pure
mathematics: Herr Dühring thinks that he can produce it <i>a priori</i> that
is, without making use of the experience offered us by the external world, can
construct it in his head.</p>
<a id="094"></a>
<p class="quoted">In pure mathematics the mind deals “with its own free
creations and imaginations” {D. Ph. 43}; the concepts of number and
figure are “the adequate object of that pure science which it can create
of itself” {42}, and hence it has a “validity which is independent
of <i>particular</i> experience and of the real content of the world”
{43}.</p>
<a id="095"></a>
<p class="fst">That pure mathematics has a validity which is independent of the
<i>particular</i> experience of each individual is, for that matter, correct,
and this is true of all established facts in every science, and indeed of all
facts whatsoever. The magnetic poles, the fact that water is composed of
hydrogen and oxygen, the fact that Hegel is dead and Herr Dühring alive, hold
good independently of my own experience or that of any other individual, and
even independently of Herr Dühring’s experience, when he begins to sleep
the sleep of the just. But it is not at all true that in pure mathematics the
mind deals only with its own creations and imaginations. The concepts of number
and figure have not been derived from any source other than the world of
reality. The ten fingers on which men learnt to count, that is, to perform the
first arithmetical operation, are anything but a free creation of the mind.
Counting requires not only objects that can be counted, but also the ability to
exclude all properties of the objects considered except their number —
and this ability is the product of a long historical development based on
experience. Like the idea of number, so the idea of figure is borrowed
exclusively from the external world, and does not arise in the mind out of pure
thought. There must have been things which had shape and whose shapes were
compared before anyone could arrive at the idea of figure. Pure mathematics
deals with the space forms and quantity relations of the real world —
that is, with material which is very real indeed. The fact that this material
appears in an extremely abstract form can only superficially conceal its origin
from the external world. But in order to make it possible to investigate these
forms and relations in their pure state, it is necessary to separate them
entirely from their content, to put the content aside as irrelevant; thus we
get points without dimensions, lines without breadth and thickness, <i>a</i>
and <i>b</i> and <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, constants and variables; and only
at the very end do we reach the free creations and imaginations of the mind
itself, that is to say, imaginary magnitudes. Even the apparent derivation of
mathematical magnitudes from each other does not prove their <i>a priori</i>
origin, but only their rational connection. Before one came upon the idea of
deducing the <i>form</i> of a cylinder from the rotation of a rectangle about
one of its sides, a number of real rectangles and cylinders, however imperfect
in form, must have been examined. Like all other sciences, mathematics arose
out of the <i>needs</i> of men: from the measurement of land and the content
of vessels, from the computation of time and from mechanics. But, as in every
department of thought, at a certain stage of development the laws, which were
abstracted from the real world, become divorced from the real world, and are
set up against it as something independent, as laws coming from outside, to
which the world has to conform. That is how things happened in society and in
the state, and in this way, and not otherwise, <i>pure</i> mathematics was
subsequently <i>applied</i> to the world, although it is borrowed from this
same world and represents only one part of its forms of interconnection —
and it is only <i>just because of this</i> that it can be applied at all.</p>
<a id="096"></a>
<p>But just as Herr Dühring imagines that, out of the axioms of mathematics,</p>
<a id="097"></a>
<p class="quoted">“which also in accordance with pure logic neither
require nor are capable of substantiation” {34},</p>
<a id="098"></a>
<p class="fst">he can deduce the whole of pure mathematics without any kind of
empirical admixture, and then apply it to the world, so he likewise imagines
that he can, in the first place, produce out of his head the basic forms of
being, the simple elements of all knowledge, the axioms of philosophy, deduce
from these the whole of philosophy or world schematism, and then, by sovereign
decree, impose this constitution of his on nature and humanity. Unfortunately
nature is not at all, and humanity only to an infinitesimal degree, composed of
the Manteuffelite Prussians of 1850. <a href="footnotes.html#n34" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[34]</sup></a></p>
<a id="099"></a>
<p>Mathematical axioms are expressions of the scantiest thought-content, which
mathematics is obliged to borrow from logic. They can be reduced to two:</p>
<a id="100"></a>
<p>1) The whole is greater than its part. This statement is pure tautology, as
the quantitatively conceived idea “part” is from the outset definitely related
to the idea “whole”, and in fact in such a way that “part” simply means that
the quantitative “whole” consists of several quantitative “parts”. In stating
this explicitly, the so-called axiom does not take us a step further. This
tautology can even in a way <i>be proved</i> by saying: a whole is that which
consists of several parts; a part is that of which several make a whole; hence
the part is less than the whole — in which the inanity of repetition
brings out even more clearly the inanity of content.</p>
<a id="101"></a>
<p>2) If two quantities are equal to a third, they are equal to each other.
This statement, as Hegel has already shown, is a conclusion, the correctness of
which is vouched for by logic, and which is therefore proved, although outside
of pure mathematics. The remaining axioms relating to equality and inequality
are merely logical extensions of this conclusion.</p>
<a id="102"></a>
<p>These meagre principles do not cut much ice, either in mathematics or
anywhere else. In order to get any further, we are obliged to bring in real
relations, relations and space forms which are taken from real bodies. The
ideas of lines, planes, angles, polygons, cubes, spheres, etc., are all taken
from reality, and it requires a pretty good portion of naive ideology to
believe the mathematicians that the first line came into existence through the
movement of a point in space, the first plane through the movement of a line,
the first solid through the movement of a plane, and so on. Even language
rebels against such a conception. A mathematical figure of three dimensions is
called a solid body, <i>corpus solidum</i>, hence, in Latin, even a tangible
object; it therefore has a name derived from sturdy reality and by no means
from the free imagination of the mind.</p>
<a id="103"></a>
<p>But why all this prolixity? After Herr Dühring, on pages 42 and 43, <a href="footnotes.html#n35" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[35]</sup></a> has enthusiastically
sung the independence of pure mathematics from the world of experience, its
apriority, its preoccupation with the mind’s own free creations and
imaginations, he says on page 63:</p>
<a id="104"></a>
<p class="quoted">“It is, of course, easily overlooked that those mathematical
elements (number, magnitude, time, space and geometric motion) are <i>ideal
only in their form</i>, <i>... absolute magnitudes</i> are therefore
something completely <i>empirical</i>, no matter to what species they
belong”, ... but “mathematical schemata are capable of characterisation which
is adequate even though <i>divorced</i> from experience.”</p>
<a id="105"></a>
<p class="fst">The last statement is more or less true of <i>every</i>
abstraction, but does not by any means prove that it is not abstracted from
reality. In world schematism pure mathematics arose out of pure thought —
in the philosophy of nature it is something completely empirical, taken from
the external world and then divorced from it. Which are we to believe?</p>

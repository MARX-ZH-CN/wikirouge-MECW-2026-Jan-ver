<h1>VIII. Capital and Surplus-Value<br>
(Conclusion)</h1>
<p class="fst">“In Herr Marx’s view, wages represent only the
payment of that labour-time during which the labourer is actually working to
make his own existence possible. But only a small number of hours is required
for this purpose; all the rest of the working-day, often so prolonged, yields a
surplus in which is contained what our author calls
‘surplus-value’, or, expressed in everyday language, the earnings
of capital. If we leave out of account the labour-time which at each stage of
production is already contained in the instruments of labour and in the
pertinent raw material, this surplus part of the working-day is the share which
falls to the capitalist entrepreneur. The prolongation of the working-day is
consequently earnings of pure exploitation for the benefit of the
capitalist” {D. K. G. 500-01}. <a id="177"></a></p>
<p class="fst">According to Herr Dühring, therefore, Marx’s surplus-value
would be nothing more than what, expressed in everyday language, is known as
the earnings of capital, or profit. Let us see what Marx says himself. On page
195 of <i>Capital</i>, surplus-value is explained in the following words
placed in brackets after it: “Interest, Profit, Rent”. On page 210,
Marx gives an example in which a total surplus-value of £3.11.0. appears in the
different forms in which it is distributed: tithes, rates and taxes, £1.10;
rent £1.80; farmer’s profit and interest, £1.20; together making a total
surplus-value of £3.11.0.—On page 542, Marx points out as one of
Ricardo’s main shortcomings that he “has not {...} investigated
surplus-value as such, i.e., independently of its particular forms, such as
profit, rent, etc.”, and that he therefore lumps together the laws of the
rate of surplus-value and the laws of the rate of profit; against this Marx
announces: “I shall show in Book III that, with a given rate of
surplus-value, we may have any number of rates of profit, and that various
rates of surplus-value may, under given conditions, express themselves in a
single rate of profit.” On page 587 we find: “The capitalist who
produces surplus-value—i.e., who extracts unpaid labour directly from the
labourers, and fixes it in commodities, is, indeed, the first appropriator, but
by no means the ultimate owner, of this surplus-value. He has to share it with
capitalists, with landowners, etc., who fulfil other functions in the complex
of social production. Surplus-value, therefore, splits up into various parts.
Its fragments fall to various categories of persons, and take various forms,
independent the one of the other, such as profit, interest, merchants’
profit, rent, etc. It is only in Book III that we can take in hand these
modified forms of surplus-value.” And there are many other similar
passages. <a id="178"></a></p>
<p>It is impossible to express oneself more clearly. On each occasion Marx
calls attention to the fact that his surplus-value must not be confounded with
profit or the earnings of capital; that this latter is rather a subform and
frequently even only a fragment of surplus-value. And if in spite of this Herr
Dühring asserts that Marxian surplus-value, “expressed in everyday
language, is the earnings of capital”; and if it is an actual fact that
the whole of Marx’s book turns on surplus-value—then there are only
two possibilities: Either Herr Dühring does not know any better, and then it is
an unparalleled act of impudence to decry a book of whose main content he is
ignorant; or he knows what it is all about, and in that case he has committed a
deliberate act of falsification. <a id="179"></a></p>
<p>To proceed: <a id="180"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“The venomous hatred with which Herr Marx presents this
conception of the business of extortion is only too understandable. But even
mightier wrath and even fuller recognition of the exploitative character of the
economic form which is based on wage-labour is possible without accepting the
theoretical position expressed in Marx's doctrine of surplus-value” {D.
K. G. 501}. <a id="181"></a></p>
<p class="fst">The well-meant but erroneous theoretical position taken up by
Marx stirs in him a venomous hatred against the business of extortion; but in
consequence of his false “theoretical position” the emotion, in
itself ethical, receives an unethical expression, manifesting itself in ignoble
hatred and low venomousness, while the definitive and most strictly scientific
treatment {498} by Herr Dühring expresses itself in ethical emotion of a
correspondingly noble nature, in wrath which even in form is ethically superior
and in venomous hatred is also quantitatively superior, is a mightier wrath.
While Herr Dühring is gleefully admiring himself in this way, let us see where
this mightier wrath stems from. <a id="182"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">We read on: “Now the question arises, how the competing
entrepreneurs are able constantly to realise the full product of labour,
including the surplus-product, at a price so far above the natural outlays of
production as is indicated by the ratio, already mentioned, of the surplus
labour-hours. No answer to this is to be found in Marx's theory, and for the
simple reason that there could be no place in it for even raising that
question. The luxury character of production based on hired labour is not
seriously dealt with at all, and the social constitution with its exploitatory
features is in no way recognised as the ultimate basis of white slavery. On the
contrary, political and social matters are always to be explained by
economics” {501}. <a id="183"></a></p>
<p class="fst">Now we have seen from the above passages that Marx does not at
all assert that the industrial capitalist, who first appropriates the
surplus-product, sells it regardless of circumstances on the average at its
full value, as is here assumed by Herr Dühring. Marx says expressly that
merchants’ profit also forms a part of surplus-value, and on the
assumptions made this is only possible when the manufacturer sells his product
to the merchant <i>below</i> its value, and thus relinquishes to him a part
of the booty. The way the question is put here, there clearly could be no place
in Marx for even raising it. Stated in a rational way, the question is: How is
surplus-value transformed into its subforms: profit, interest, merchants'
profit, land rent, and so forth? And Marx, to be sure, promises to settle this
question in the third book. But if Herr Dühring cannot wait until the second
volume of <i>Capital</i> <a href="footnotes.html#n88" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[88]</sup></a> appears he should in the meantime take a closer
look at the first volume. In addition to the passages already quoted, he would
then see, for example on p. 323, that according to Marx the immanent laws of
capitalist production assert themselves in the external movements of individual
masses of capital as coercive laws of competition, and in this form are brought
home to the mind and consciousness of the individual capitalist as the
directing motives of his operations that therefore a scientific analysis of
competition is not possible before we have a conception of the inner nature of
capital, just as the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies are not
intelligible to any but him who is acquainted with their real motions, which
are not directly perceptible by the senses; and then Marx gives an example to
show how in a definite case, a definite law, the law of value, manifests itself
and exercises its motive power in competition. Herr Dühring might see from this
alone that competition plays a leading part in the distribution of
surplus-value, and with some reflection the indications given in the first
volume are in fact enough to make clear, at least in its main features, the
transformation of surplus-value into its subforms. <a id="184"></a></p>
<p>But competition is precisely what absolutely prevents Herr Dühring from
understanding the process. He cannot comprehend how the competing entrepreneurs
are able constantly to realise the full product of labour, including the
surplus-product, at prices so far above the natural outlays of production. Here
again we find his customary “strictness” {D. C. 95} of expression,
which in fact is simply slovenliness. In <i>Marx</i>, the surplus-product as
such has <i>absolutely no outlays of production;</i> it is the part of the
product which <i>costs nothing</i> to the capitalist. If therefore the
competing entrepreneurs desired to realise the surplus-product at its natural
outlays of production, they would have simply <i>to give it away.</i> But do
not let us waste time on such “micrological details” {D. K. G.
507}. Are not the competing entrepreneurs every day selling the product of
labour above its natural outlays of production? According to Herr Dühring, the
natural outlays of production consist <a id="185"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“in the expenditure of labour or energy, and this in
turn, in the last analysis, can be measured by the expenditure of food”
{D. C. 274}; <a id="186"></a></p>
<p class="fst">that is, in present-day society, these costs consist in the
outlays really expended on raw materials, means of labour, and wages, as
distinguished from the “tax” {D. C. 135}, the profit, the surcharge
levied sword in hand {23}. Now everyone knows that in the society in which we
live the competing entrepreneurs do <i>not</i> realise their commodities at
the natural outlays of production, but that they add on to these—and as a
rule also receive — the so-called surcharge, the profit. The question
which Herr Dühring thinks he has only to raise to blow down the whole Marxian
structure — as Joshua once blew down the walls of Jericho <a href="footnotes.html#n89" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[89]</sup></a> — this
question also exists for Herr Dühring's economic theory. Let us see how he
answers it. <a id="187"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“Capital ownership,” he says, “has no
practical meaning, and cannot be realised, unless indirect force against human
material is simultaneously incorporated in it. The product of this force is
earnings of capital, and the magnitude of the latter <i>will</i> therefore
depend on the range and intensity in which this power is exercised {179} ...
Earnings of capital are a political and social institution which exerts a more
powerful influence than competition. In relation to this the capitalists act as
a social estate, and each one of them maintains his position. A certain measure
of earnings of capital is a necessity under the prevailing mode of
economy” {180}. <a id="188"></a></p>
<p class="fst">Unfortunately even now we do not know how the competing
entrepreneurs are able constantly to realise the product of labour above the
natural outlays of production. It cannot be that Herr Dühring thinks so little
of his public as to fob it off with the phrase that earnings of capital are
above competition, just as the King of Prussia was above the law. <a href="footnotes.html#n90" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[90]</sup></a> We know the
manoeuvres by which the King of Prussia attained his position above the law;
the manoeuvres by which the earnings of capital succeed in being more powerful
than competition are precisely what Herr Dühring should explain to us, but what
he obstinately refuses to explain. And it is of no avail, if, as he tells us,
the capitalists act in this connection as an estate, and each one of them
maintains his position. We surely cannot be expected to take his word for it
that a number of people only need to act as an estate for each one of them to
maintain his position. Everyone knows that the guildsmen of the Middle Ages and
the French nobles in 1789 acted very definitely as estates and perished
nevertheless. The Prussian army at Jena <a href="footnotes.html#n91" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[91]</sup></a> also acted as an estate, but instead of
maintaining their position they had on the contrary to take to their heels and
afterwards even to capitulate in sections. Just as little can we be satisfied
with the assurance that a certain measure of earnings of capital is a necessity
under the prevailing mode of economy; for the point to be proved is precisely
<i>why</i> this is so. We do not get a step nearer to the goal when Herr
Dühring informs us: <a id="189"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“The domination of capital arose in close connection
with the domination of land. Part of the agricultural serfs were transformed in
the towns into craftsmen and ultimately into factory material. After the rent
of land, earnings of capital developed as a second form of rent of
possession” {176}. <a id="190"></a></p>
<p class="fst">Even if we ignore the historical inexactitude of this assertion,
it nevertheless remains a mere assertion, and is restricted to assuring us over
and over again of precisely what should be explained and proved. We can
therefore come to no other conclusion than that Herr Dühring is incapable of
answering his own question: how the competing entrepreneurs are able constantly
to realise the product of labour above the natural outlays of production; that
is to say, he is incapable of explaining the genesis of profit. He can only
bluntly decree: earnings of capital shall be the product of <i>force</i>
— which, true enough, is completely in accordance with Article 2 of the
Dühringian constitution of society: Force distributes. This is certainly
expressed very nicely; but now “the question arises” {D. K. G.
501}: Force distributes—what? Surely there must be something to
distribute, or even the most omnipotent force, with the best will in the world,
can distribute nothing. The earnings pocketed by the competing capitalists are
something very tangible and solid. Force can <i>seize</i> them, but cannot
<i>produce</i> them. And if Herr Dühring obstinately refuses to explain to us
<i>how</i> force seizes the earnings of capitalists, the question of
<i>whence</i> force takes them he meets only with silence, the silence of the
grave. Where there is nothing, the king, like any other force, loses his
rights. Out of nothing comes nothing, and certainly not profit. If capital
ownership has no practical meaning, and cannot be realised, unless indirect
force against human material is simultaneously embodied in it, then once again
the question arises, first, how capital-wealth got this force—a question
which is not settled in the least by the couple of historical assertions cited
above; secondly, how this force is transformed into an accession of capital
value, into profit; and thirdly, where it obtains this profit. <a id="191"></a></p>
<p>From whatever side we approach Dühringian economics, we do not get one step
further. For every obnoxious phenomenon—profit, land rent, starvation
wages, the enslavement of the workers—he has only one word of
explanation: force, and ever again force, and Herr Dühring's “mightier
wrath” {501} finally resolves itself into wrath at force. We have seen,
first, that this invocation of force is a lame subterfuge, a relegation of the
problem from the sphere of economics to that of politics, which is unable to
explain a single economic fact; and secondly, that it leaves unexplained the
origin of force itself—and very prudently so, for otherwise it would have
to come to the conclusion that all social power and all political force have
their source in economic preconditions, in the mode of production and exchange
historically given for each society at each period. <a id="192"></a></p>
<p>But let us see whether we cannot wrest from the inexorable builder of
“deeper foundations” {see D. C. 11} of political economy some
further disclosures about profit. Perhaps we shall meet with success if we
apply ourselves to his treatment of wages. On page 158 we find: <a id="193"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“Wages are the hire paid for the maintenance of
labour-power, and are at first taken into consideration only as a basis for the
rent of land and earnings of capital. In order to get absolute clarity as to
the relationships obtaining in this field, one must conceive the rent of land,
and subsequently also earnings of capital, first historically, without wages,
that is to say, on the basis of slavery or serfdom... Whether it is a slave or
a serf, or a wage-labourer who has to be maintained, only gives rise to a
difference in the mode of charging the costs of production. <i>In every case
the net proceeds obtained by the utilisation of labour-power constitute the
income of the master</i>... It can therefore be seen that... the chief
antithesis, by virtue of which there exists on the one hand some form of
<i>rent of possession</i> and on the other hand propertyless hired labour, is
not to be found exclusively in one of its members, but always only in both at
the same time.” <a id="194"></a></p>
<p class="fst">Rent of possession, however, as we learn on page 188, is a
phrase which covers both land rent and earnings of capital. Further, we find on
page 174: <a id="195"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“The characteristic feature of earnings of capital is
that they are an <i>appropriation of the most important part of the proceeds
of labour-power.</i> They cannot be conceived except in correlation with some
form of directly or indirectly subjected labour.” <a id="196"></a></p>
<p class="fst">And on page 183: <a id="197"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">Wages “are in all circumstances nothing more than the
hire by means of which, generally speaking, the labourer's maintenance and
possibility of procreation must be assured”. <a id="198"></a></p>
<p class="fst">And finally, on page 195: <a id="199"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“The portion that falls to rent of possession must be
lost to wages, and vice versa, the portion of the general productive
capacity” (!) “that reaches labour must necessarily be taken from
the revenues of possession.” <a id="200"></a></p>
<p class="fst">Herr Dühring leads us from one surprise to another. In his
theory of value and the following chapters up to and including the theory of
competition, that is, from page 1 to page 155, the prices of commodities or
values were divided, first, into natural outlays of production or the
production value, i.e., the outlays on raw materials, instruments of labour and
wages; and secondly, into the surcharge or distribution value {27}, that
tribute levied sword in hand {23} for the benefit of the monopolist
class—a surcharge which, as we have seen, could not in reality make any
change in the distribution of wealth, for what it took with one hand it would
have to give back with the other, and which, besides, in so far as Herr Dühring
enlightens us as to its origin and nature, arose out of nothing and therefore
consists of nothing. In the two succeeding chapters, which deal with the kinds
of revenue, that is, from page 156 to 217, there is no further mention of the
surcharge. Instead of this, the value of every product of labour, that is, of
every commodity, is now divided into the two following portions: first, the
production costs, in which the wages paid are included; and secondly, the
<i>“net proceeds</i> obtained by the utilisation of
labour-power”, which constitute the master’s income. And these net
proceeds have a very well-known physiognomy, which no tattooing and no
house-painter's art can conceal. “In order to get absolute clarity as to
the relationships obtaining in this field” {158}, let the reader imagine
the passages just cited from Herr Dühring printed opposite the passages
previously cited from Marx, dealing with surplus-labour, surplus-product and
surplus-value, and he will find that Herr Dühring is here, though in his own
style, <i>directly copying</i> from <i>Capital.</i> <a id="201"></a></p>
<p>Surplus-labour, in any form, whether of slavery, serfdom or wage-labour, is
recognised by Herr Dühring as the source of the revenues of all ruling classes
up to now; this is taken from the much-quoted passage in <i>Capital</i>, p.
227: Capital has not invented surplus-labour, and so on.—And the
“net proceeds” which constitute “the income of the
master” — what is that but the surplus of the labour product over
and above the wages, which, even in Herr Dühring, in spite of his quite
superfluous disguise of it in the term “hire”, must assure,
generally speaking, the labourer's maintenance and possibility of procreation?
How can the “appropriation of the most important part of the proceeds of
labour-power” {174} be carried out except by the capitalist, as Marx
shows, extorting from the labourer more labour than is necessary for the
reproduction of the means of subsistence consumed by the latter; that is to
say, by the capitalist making the labourer work a longer time than is necessary
for the replacement of the value of the wages paid to the labourer? Thus the
prolongation of the working-day beyond the time necessary for the reproduction
of the labourer’s means of subsistence—Marx’s
surplus-labour—this, and nothing but this, is what is concealed behind
Herr Dühring's “utilisation of labour-power”; and his “net
proceeds” {158} falling to the master—how can they manifest
themselves otherwise than in the Marxian surplus-product and surplus-value? And
what, apart from its inexact formulation, is there to distinguish the
Dühringian rent of possession from the Marxian surplus-value? For the rest,
Herr Dühring has taken the name “rent of possession” <span class="context">[“<i>Besitzrente</i>“]</span> from Rodbertus, who
included both the rent of land and the rent of capital, or earnings of capital,
under the one term <i>rent</i>, so that Herr Dühring had only to add
"possession" to it. <a href="notes.html#n*6" target=_blank>*6</a> And so that no doubt may be
left of his plagiarism, Herr Dühring sums up, in his own way, the laws of the
changes of magnitude in the price of labour-power and in surplus-value which
are developed by Marx in Chapter XV (page 539, <i>et seqq.</i>, of
<i>Capital</i>), and does it in such a manner that what falls to the rent of
possession must be lost to wages, and vice versa, thereby reducing certain
Marxian laws, so rich in content, to a tautology without content—for it
is self-evident that of a given magnitude falling into two parts, one part
cannot increase unless the other decreases. And so Herr Dühring has succeeded
in appropriating the ideas of Marx in such a way that the "definitive and most
strictly scientific treatment in the sense of the exact disciplines" {D. K. G.
498}—which is certainly present in Marx's exposition—is completely
lost. <a id="202"></a></p>
<p>We therefore cannot avoid the conclusion that the strange commotion which
Herr Dühring makes in the <i>Kritische Geschichte</i> over <i>Capital</i>,
and the dust he raises with the famous question that comes up in connection
with surplus-value (a question which he had better have left unasked, inasmuch
as he cannot answer it himself)—that all this is only a military ruse, a
sly manoeuvre to cover up the gross plagiarism of Marx committed in the
<i>Cursus</i> Herr Dühring had in fact every reason for warning his readers
not to occupy themselves with “the intricate maze which Herr Marx calls
<i>Capital”</i> {D. K. G. 497}, with the bastards of historical and
logical fantasy, the confused and hazy Hegelian notions and jugglery {498},
etc. The Venus against whom this faithful Eckart warns the German youth had
been taken by him stealthily from the Marxian preserves and brought to a safe
place for his own use. We must congratulate him on these net proceeds derived
from the utilisation of Marx's labour-power, and on the peculiar light thrown
by his annexation of Marxian surplus-value under the name of rent of possession
on the motives for his obstinate (repeated in two editions) and false assertion
that by the term surplus-value Marx meant only profit or earnings of capital.
<a id="203"></a></p>
<p>And so we have to portray Herr Dühring's achievements in Herr Dühring's own
words as follows: <a id="204"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“In Herr” Dühring's “view wages represent only the payment of
that labour-time during which the labourer is actually working to make his own
existence possible. But only a small number of hours is required for this
purpose; all the rest of the working-day, often so prolonged, yields a surplus
in which is contained what our author calls” {500} — rent of possession.
“If we leave out of account the labour-time which at each stage of production
is already contained in the instruments of labour and in the pertinent raw
material, this surplus part of the working-day is the share which falls to the
capitalist entrepreneur. The prolongation of the working-day is consequently
earnings of pure extortion for the benefit of the capitalist. The venomous
hatred with which Herr” Dühring “presents this conception of the business of
exploitation is only too understandable” {501}... <a id="205"></a></p>
<p class="fst">But what is less understandable is how he will now arrive once
more at his “mightier wrath” {501}. <a id="206"></a></p>

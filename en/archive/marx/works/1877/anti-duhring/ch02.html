<h1>IV. World Schematism</h1>
<a id="108"></a>
<p class="quoted">“All-embracing being is <i>one.</i> In its
self-sufficiency it has nothing alongside it or over it. To associate a second
being with it would be to make it something that it is not, namely, a part or
constituent of a more comprehensive whole. Due to the fact that we extend our
<i>unified</i> thought like a framework, nothing that should be comprised in
this thought-unity can retain a duality within itself. Nor, again, can anything
escape this thought-unity... The essence of all thought consists in bringing
together the elements of consciousness into a unity {D. Ph. 16} ... It is the
point of unity of the synthesis where the <i>indivisible idea of the
world</i> came into being and the universe, as the name itself implies, is
apprehended as something in which everything is united into
<i>unity</i>” {17}.</p>
<a id="109"></a>
<p class="fst">Thus far Herr Dühring. This is the first application of the
mathematical method:</p>
<a id="110"></a>
<p class="quoted">“Every question is to be decided <i>axiomatically</i>
in accordance with simple basic forms, as if we were dealing with the simple
... principles of mathematics” {224}.</p>
<a id="111"></a>
<p class="fst"><span class="duhring">“All-embracing being is
one.”</span> If tautology, the simple repetition in the predicate of what
is already expressed in the subject — if that makes an axiom, then we
have here one of the purest water. Herr Dühring tells us in the subject that
being embraces everything, and in the predicate he intrepidly declares that in
that case there is nothing outside it. What colossal <span class="duhring">“system-creating thought”</span> {525}!</p>
<a id="112"></a>
<p>This is indeed system-creating! Within the space of the next six lines Herr
Dühring has transformed the <i>oneness</i> of being, by means of our unified
thought, into its <i>unit.</i> As the essence of all thought consists in
bringing things together into a unity, so being, as soon as it is conceived, is
conceived as unified, and the idea of the world as indivisible; and because
<i>conceived</i> being, the <i>idea of the world</i>, is unified, therefore
real being, the real world, is also an indivisible unity. And with that</p>
<a id="113"></a>
<p class="quoted">“there is no longer any room for things beyond, once
the mind has learnt to conceive being in its homogeneous universality”
{D. Ph. 523}.</p>
<a id="114"></a>
<p class="fst">That is a campaign which puts Austerlitz and Jena, Königgrätz
and Sedan completely in the shade. <a href="footnotes.html#n36" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[36]</sup></a> In a few sentences, hardly a page after we have
mobilised the first axiom, we have already done away with, cast overboard,
destroyed, everything beyond the world — God and the heavenly hosts,
heaven, hell and purgatory, along with the immortality of the soul.</p>
<a id="115"></a>
<p>How do we get from the oneness of being to its unity? By the very fact of
conceiving it. In so far as we spread our unified thought around being like a
frame, its oneness becomes a unity in thought, a thought-unity; for the essence
of <i>all</i> thought consists in bringing together the elements of
consciousness into a unity.</p>
<a id="116"></a>
<p>This last statement is simply untrue. In the first place, thought consists
just as much in the taking apart of objects of consciousness into their
elements as in the putting together of related elements into a unity. Without
analysis, no synthesis. Secondly, without making blunders thought can bring
together into a unity only those elements of consciousness in which or in whose
real prototypes this unity already <i>existed before.</i> If I include a
shoe-brush in the unity mammals, this does not help it to get mammary glands.
The unity of being, or rather, the question whether its conception as a unity
is justified, is therefore precisely what was to be proved; and when Herr
Dühring assures us that he conceives being as a unity and not as twofold, he
tells us nothing more than his own unauthoritative opinion.</p>
<a id="117"></a>
<p>If we try to state his process of thought in unalloyed form, we get the
following: I begin with being. I therefore think what being is. The thought of
being is a unified thought. But thinking and being must be in agreement, they
are in conformity with each other, they <span class="duhring">“coincide”</span>. Therefore being is a unity also
in reality. Therefore there cannot be anything <span class="duhring">“beyond”</span>. If Herr Dühring had spoken without
disguise in this way, instead of treating us to the above oracular passages,
his ideology would have been clearly visible. To attempt to prove the reality
of any product of thought by the identity of thinking and being was indeed one
of the most absurd delirious fantasies of — a Hegel.</p>
<a id="118"></a>
<p>Even if his whole method of proof had been correct, Herr Dühring would still
not have won an inch of ground from the spiritualists. The latter would reply
briefly: to us, too, the universe is simple; the division into this world and
the world beyond exists only for our specifically earthly, original-sin
standpoint; in and for itself, that is, in God, all being is a unity. And they
would accompany Herr Dühring to his other beloved celestial bodies and show him
one or several on which there had been no original sin, where therefore no
opposition exists between this world and the beyond, and where the unity of the
universe is a dogma of faith.</p>
<a id="119"></a>
<p>The most comical part of the business is that Herr Dühring, in order to
prove the non-existence of God from the idea of being, uses the ontological
proof for the existence of God. This runs: when we think of God, we conceive
him as the sum total of all perfections. But the sum total of all perfections
includes above all existence, since. a non-existent being is necessarily
imperfect. We must therefore include existence among the perfections of God.
Hence God must exist. Herr Dühring reasons in exactly the same way: when we
think of <i>being</i>, we conceive it as <i>one</i> idea. Whatever is
comprised in <i>one</i> idea is a unity. Being would not correspond to the
idea of being if it were not a unity. Consequently it must be a unity.
Consequently there is no God, and so on.</p>
<a id="120"></a>
<p>When we speak of <i>being</i>, and <i>purely</i> of being, unity can
only consist in that all the objects to which we are referring —
<i>are</i>, exist. They are comprised in the unity of this being, and in no
other unity, and the general dictum that they all <i>are</i> not only cannot
give them any additional qualities, whether common or not, but provisionally
excludes all such qualities from consideration. For as soon as we depart even a
millimetre from the simple basic fact that being is common to all these things,
the <i>differences</i> between these things begin to emerge — and
whether these differences consist in the circumstance that some are white and
others black, that some are animate and others inanimate, that some may be of
this world and others of the world beyond, cannot be decided by us from the
fact that mere existence is in equal manner ascribed to them all.</p>
<a id="121"></a>
<p>The unity of the world does not consist in its being, although its being is
a precondition of its unity, as it must certainly first <i>be</i> before it
can be <i>one.</i> Being, indeed, is always an open question beyond the point
where our sphere of observation ends. <a id="ad1"></a> <i>The real unity of
the world consists in its materiality, and this is proved not by a few juggled
phrases, but by a long and wearisome development of philosophy and natural
science.</i></p>
<a id="122"></a>
<p>To return to the text. The <i>being</i> which Herr Dühring is telling us
about is</p>
<a id="123"></a>
<p class="quoted">“not that pure, self-equal being which lacks all
special determinants, and in fact represents only the counterpart of the idea
of <i>nothing</i> or of the absence of idea” {D. Ph. 22}.</p>
<a id="124"></a>
<p class="fst">But we shall see very soon that Herr Dühring's universe really
starts with a being which lacks all inner differentiation, all motion and
change, and is therefore in fact only a counterpart of the idea of nothing, and
therefore really nothing. Only out of this <i>being-nothing</i> develops the
present differentiated, changing state of the universe, which represents a
development, a <i>becoming;</i> and it is only after we have grasped this
that we are able, even within this perpetual change, to</p>
<a id="125"></a>
<p class="quoted">“maintain the conception of universal being in a
self-equal state” {D. Ph. 23}.</p>
<a id="126"></a>
<p class="fst">We have now, therefore, the idea of being on a higher plane,
where it includes within itself both inertness and change, being and becoming.
Having reached this point, we find that</p>
<a id="127"></a>
<p class="quoted">“genus and species, or the general and the particular,
are the simplest means of differentiation, without which the constitution of
things cannot be understood” {24}.</p>
<a id="128"></a>
<p class="fst">But these are means of differentiation of <i>qualities;</i>
and after these have been dealt with, we proceed:</p>
<a id="129"></a>
<p class="quoted">“in opposition to genus stands the concept of
magnitude, as of a homogeneity in which no further differences of species
exist” {26};</p>
<a id="130"></a>
<p class="fst">and so from <i>quality</i> we pass to <i>quantity</i>, and
this is always “<i>measurable</i>” {26}.</p>
<a id="131"></a>
<p>Let us now compare this <span class="duhring">“sharp division of the
general effect-schemata”</span> {D.C. 6} and its <span class="duhring">“really critical standpoint”</span> {D. Ph. 404}
with the crudities, wild ravings and delirious fantasies of a Hegel. We find
that Hegel's logic starts from <i>being</i> — as with Herr Dühring;
that being turns out to be <i>nothing</i>, just as with Herr Dühring; that
from this being-nothing there is a transition to <i>becoming</i> the result
of which is determinate being [Dasein], i.e., a higher, fuller form of being
[Sein] — just the same as with Herr Dühring. Determinate being leads on
to <i>quality</i>, and quality on to <i>quantity</i> — just the same
as with Herr Dühring. And so that no essential feature may be missing, Herr
Dühring tells us on another occasion:</p>
<a id="132"></a>
<p class="quoted">“From the realm of non-sensation a transition is made
to that of sensation, in spite of all quantitative gradations, only through a
<i>qualitative leap</i>, of which we can say that it is infinitely different
from the mere gradation of one and the same property” {142}.</p>
<a id="133"></a>
<p class="fst">This is precisely the Hegelian nodal dine of measure relations,
in which, at certain definite nodal points, the purely quantitative increase or
decrease gives rise to a <i>qualitative leap;</i> for example, in the case of
heated or cooled water, where boiling-point and freezing-point are the nodes at
which — under normal pressure — the leap to a new state of
aggregation takes place, and where consequently quantity is transformed into
quality.</p>
<a id="134"></a>
<p>Our investigation has likewise tried to reach down to the roots, and it
finds the roots of the deep-rooted basic schemata of Herr Dühring to be —
the <span class="duhring">“delirious fantasies”</span> of a Hegel,
the categories of Hegelian <i>Logic</i>, Part I, the Doctrine of Being, in
strictly old-Hegelian <span class="duhring">“succession”</span> and
with hardly any attempt to cloak the plagiarism!</p>
<a id="135"></a>
<p>And not content with pilfering from his worst-slandered predecessor the
latter's whole scheme of being, Herr Dühring, after himself giving the
above-quoted example of the leaplike change from quantity into quality, says of
Marx without the slightest perturbation:</p>
<a id="136"></a>
<p class="quoted">“How ridiculous, for example, is the reference”
(made by Marx) “to the Hegelian <i>confused</i>, <i>hazy notion</i>
that <i>quantity is transformed into quality</i>!” {D. K. G. 498}.</p>
<a id="137"></a>
<p class="fst">Confused, hazy notion! Who has been transformed here? And who is
ridiculous here, Herr Dühring?</p>
<a id="138"></a>
<p>All these pretty little things are therefore not only not <span class="duhring">“axiomatically decided”</span>, as prescribed, but
are merely imported from outside, that is to say, from Hegel&amp;rsquo;s
<i>Logic.</i> And in fact in such a form that in the whole chapter there is
not even the semblance of any internal coherence unless borrowed from Hegel,
and the whole question finally trickles out in a meaningless subtilising about
space and time, inertness and change.</p>
<a id="139"></a>
<p>From being Hegel passes to essence, to dialectics. Here he deals with the
determinations of reflection, their internal <i>antagonisms</i> and
contradictions, as for example, positive and negative; he then comes to
<i>causality</i> or the relation of cause and effect and ends with
<i>necessity.</i> Not otherwise Herr Dühring. What Hegel calls the doctrine
of essence Herr Dühring translates into <span class="duhring">“logical
properties of being”</span> {D. Ph. 29}. These, however, consist above all in
the <span class="duhring">“antagonism of forces”</span> {31}, in
<i>opposites.</i> Contradiction, however, Herr Dühring absolutely denies; we
will return to this point later. Then he passes over to <i>causality</i>, and
from this to <i>necessity. So</i> that when- Herr Dühring says of himself:</p>
<a id="140"></a>
<p class="quoted">“We, who do not philosophise out <i>of a cage</i>” {41},</p>
<a id="141"></a>
<p class="fst">he apparently means that he philosophises <i>in</i> a cage,
namely, the cage of the Hegelian schematism of categories.</p>

<h3>VIII. Philosophy of Nature.<br>
The Organic World, Conclusion</h3>
<a id="272"></a>
<p class="quoted">“Ponder ... what positive knowledge is required to
equip our section on natural philosophy with all its scientific premises. Its
basis is provided firstly by all the fundamental achievements of mathematics,
and then the principal propositions established by exact science in mechanics,
physics and chemistry, as well as the general conclusions of natural science in
physiology, zoology and similar branches of inquiry“ {D. Ph. 517}.</p>
<a id="273"></a>
<p class="fst">Such is the confidence and assurance with which Herr Dühring
speaks of the mathematical and naturalistic erudition of Herr Dühring. It is
impossible to detect from the meagre section concerned, and still less from its
even more paltry conclusions, what deep-rooted positive knowledge lies behind
them. In any case, in order to create the Dühring oracle on physics and
chemistry, it is not necessary to know any more of physics than the equation
which expresses the mechanical equivalent of heat, or any more of chemistry
than that all bodies can be divided into elements and combinations of elements.
Moreover, a person who can talk of <span class="duhring">“gravitating
atoms”</span> {81}, as Herr Dühring does (p. 131) {D. Ph.}, only proves
that he is completely <span class="duhring">“in the dark”</span> as
to the difference between atoms and molecules. As is well known, it is only
chemical action, and not gravitation or other mechanical or physical forms of
motion, that is explained by atoms. And if anyone should read as far as the
chapter on organic nature, with its vacuous, self-contradictory and, at the
decisive point, oracularly senseless meandering verbiage, and its absolutely
futile final conclusion, he will not be able to avoid forming the opinion, from
the very start, that Herr Dühring is here speaking of things of which he knows
remarkably little. This opinion becomes absolute certainty when the reader
reaches his suggestion that in the science of organic beings (biology) the term
composition should be used instead of development {114}. The person who can put
forward such a suggestion shows that he has not the faintest suspicion of the
formation of organic bodies.</p>
<a id="274"></a>
<p>All organic bodies, except the very lowest, consist of cells, small granules
of albumen which are only visible when considerably magnified, with a nucleus
inside. As a rule the cells also develop an outer membrane and the contents are
then more or less fluid. The lowest cellular bodies consist of a single cell;
the immense majority of organic beings are multi-cellular, congruous complexes
of many cells which in lower organisms remain of a homogeneous type, but in
higher organisms develop more and more varied forms, groupings and functions.
In the human body, for example, bones, muscles, nerves, tendons, ligaments,
cartilages, skin, in a word, all tissues are either composed of cells or
originated from them. But in all organic cellular structure, from the amoeba,
which is a simple and most of the time skinless albuminous particle with a
nucleus inside, up to man, and from the tiniest unicellular desmids up to the
most highly developed plant, the manner in which the cells multiply is the
same: by fission. The cell nucleus first becomes constricted in the middle, the
constriction separating the two halves of the nucleus gets more and more
pronounced, and at last they separate from each other and form two cell nuclei.
The same process takes place in the cell itself; each of the two nuclei becomes
the centre of an accumulation of cellular substance, linked to the other by a
strip which is steadily growing narrower, until at last the two separate from
each other and continue to exist as independent cells. Through such repeated
cell fission the whole animal is gradually developed in full out of the
embryonal vesicle of the animal egg, after it has been fertilised, and the
replacement of used-up tissues is effected in the same way in the adult animal.
To call such a process composition, and to say that to describe it as
development is <span class="duhring">“pure imagination”</span> {D.
Ph. 126}, certainly indicates a person who — however difficult this may
be to believe at the present day — knows absolutely nothing of this
process; here it is precisely and <i>exclusively</i> development that is
going on, and indeed development in the most literal sense, and composition has
absolutely nothing to do with it!</p>
<a id="275"></a>
<p>Later on we shall have something more to say about what Herr Dühring
understands in general by life. In particular his conception of life is as
follows:</p>
<a id="276"></a>
<p class="quoted">“The inorganic world too is a system of self-executing
impulses; but it is only at the point where there begins real differentiation,
with the circulation of substances through special channels from one internal
point and according to a germ-scheme transmissible to a smaller structure,that
we may venture to speak of real life in the narrower and stricter sense”
{141}.</p>
<a id="277"></a>
<p class="fst">This sentence is, in the narrower and stricter sense, a system
of self-executing impulses (whatever they may be) of nonsense, even apart from
its hopelessly confused grammar. If life first begins where real
differentiation commences, we must declare that the whole Haeckelian kingdom of
Protista and perhaps much else are dead, depending on the meaning we attach to
the idea of differentiation. If life first begins when this differentiation can
be transmitted through a smaller germ-scheme, then at least all organisms up to
and including unicellular ones cannot be regarded as living. If the circulation
of substances through special channels is the hallmark of life, then, in
addition to the foregoing, we must also strike from the ranks of the living the
whole of the higher class of the Coelenterata (excepting however the Medusae),
that is, all polyps and other zoophytes. <a href="footnotes.html#n43" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[43]</sup></a> If the circulation of substances through special
channels from one internal point is the essential hallmark of life, then we
must declare that all those animals which have no heart and those which have
more than one heart are dead. Under this heading would fall, in addition to
those already enumerated, all worms, starfish and rotifers (Annuloida and
Annulosa, Huxley's classification <a href="footnotes.html#n44" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[44]</sup></a>), a section of the Crustacea (lobsters), and
finally even a vertebrate animal, the lancelet (the Amphioxus). And moreover
all plants.</p>
<a id="278"></a>
<p>In undertaking, therefore, to define real life in the narrower and stricter
sense, Herr Dühring gives us four characteristics of life which totally
contradict one another, one of which condemns to eternal death not only the
whole vegetable kingdom but also about half the animal kingdom. Really no one
can say that he misled us when he promised us <span class="duhring">“from
the ground up original conclusions and views”</span> {525}!</p>
<a id="279"></a>
<p>Another passage runs:</p>
<a id="280"></a>
<p class="quoted">“In nature, too, one simple type is the basis of all
organisms, from the lowest to the highest”, and this type is <span class="duhring">“fully and completely present in its general essence even
in the most subordinate impulse of the most undeveloped plant”</span>
{305}.</p>
<a id="281"></a>
<p class="fst">This statement is again <span class="duhring">“full and
complete”</span> nonsense. The most simple type found in the whole of
organic nature is the cell, and it certainly is the basis of the higher
organisms. On the other hand, among the lowest organisms there are many which
are far below the cell — the protamoeba, a simple albuminous particle
without any differentiation whatever, and a whole series of other monera and
all bladder seaweeds (Siphoneae). All of these are linked with the higher
organisms only by the fact that their essential component is albumen and that
they consequently perform functions of albumen, i.e., live and die.</p>
<a id="282"></a>
<p>Herr Dühring further tells us:</p>
<a id="283"></a>
<p class="quoted">“Physiologically, sensation is bound up with the
presence of some kind of nerve apparatus, however simple. It is therefore
characteristic of all animal structures that they are capable of sensation,
i.e., of a subjectively conscious awareness of their states. The sharp boundary
line between plant and animal lies at the point where the leap to sensation
takes place. Far from being obliterated by the known transitional structures,
that line becomes a logical necessity precisely through these externally
undecided or undecidable forms” {D. Ph. 141-42}.</p>
<a id="284"></a>
<p class="fst">And again:</p>
<a id="285"></a>
<p class="quoted">“On the other hand, plants are completely and for all
time devoid of the slightest trace of sensation, and even lack any capacity for
it” {140}.</p>
<a id="286"></a>
<p class="fst">In the first place, Hegel says <i>(Naturphilosophie</i>,
<i>§</i> 351, Addendum) that</p>
<a id="287"></a>
<p class="quoted">“sensation is the <i>differentia specifica</i> <span class="context">[“specific difference”]</span>, the absolute
distinguishing characteristic of the animal”.</p>
<a id="288"></a>
<p class="fst">So once again we find a Hegelian <span class="duhring">“crudity”</span> {D. K. G. 235}, which through the
simple process of appropriation by Herr Dühring is raised to the honourable
position of a final and ultimate truth.</p>
<a id="289"></a>
<p>In the second place, we hear for the first time here of transitional
structures, externally undecided or undecidable forms (fine gibberish!) between
plant and animal. That these intermediate forms exist; that there are organisms
of which we cannot say flatly whether they are plants or animals; that
therefore we are wholly unable to draw a sharp dividing line between plant and
animal — precisely this fact makes it a logical necessity for Herr
Dühring to establish a criterion of differentiation which in the same breath he
admits will not hold water! But we have absolutely no need to go back to the
doubtful territory between plants and animals; are the sensitive plants which
at the slightest touch fold their leaves or close their flowers, are the
insect-eating plants devoid of the slightest trace of sensation and do they
even lack any capacity for it? This cannot be maintained even by Herr Dühring
without <span class="duhring">“unscientific semi-poetry”</span> {D.
Ph. 56, 142}.</p>
<a id="290"></a>
<p>In the third place, it is once again a free creation and imagination on Herr
Dühring's part when he asserts that sensation is physiologically bound up with
the presence of some kind of nerve apparatus, however simple. Not only all
primitive animals, but also the zoophytes, or at any rate the great majority of
them, show no trace of a nerve apparatus. It is only from the worms on that
such an apparatus is regularly found, and Herr Dühring is the first person to
make the assertion that those animals have no sensation because they have no
nerves. Sensation is not necessarily associated with nerves, but undoubtedly
with certain albuminous bodies which up to now have not been more precisely
determined.</p>
<a id="291"></a>
<p>At any rate, Herr Dühring's biological knowledge is sufficiently
characterised by the question which he does not hesitate to put to Darwin:</p>
<a id="292"></a>
<p class="quoted">“Is it to be supposed that animals have developed out
of plants?” {110}.</p>
<a id="293"></a>
<p class="fst">Such a question could only be put by a person who has not the
slightest knowledge of either animals or plants.</p>
<a id="294"></a>
<p>Of life in general Herr Dühring is only able to tell us:</p>
<a id="295"></a>
<p class="quoted">“The metabolism which is carried out through a
plastically creating schematisation” (what in the world can that be?)
<span class="duhring">“remains always a distinguishing characteristic of
the real life process”</span> {141}.</p>
<a id="296"></a>
<p class="fst">That is all we learn about life, while in the <span class="duhring">“plastically creating schematisation”</span> we are
left knee-deep in the meaningless gibberish of the purest Dühring jargon. If
therefore we want to know what life is, we shall evidently have to look a
little more closely at it ourselves.</p>
<a id="297"></a>
<p>That organic exchange of matter is the most general and most characteristic
phenomenon of life has been said times out of number during the last thirty
years by physiological chemists and chemical physiologists, and it is here
merely translated by Herr Dühring into his own elegant and clear language. But
to define life as organic metabolism is to define life as — life; for
organic exchange of matter or metabolism with plastically creating
schematisation is in fact a phrase which itself needs explanation through life,
explanation through the distinction between the organic and the inorganic, that
is, that which lives and that which does not live. This explanation therefore
does not get us any further.</p>
<a id="298"></a>
<p>Exchange of matter as such takes place even without life. There is a whole
series of processes in chemistry which, given an adequate supply of raw
material, constantly reproduce their own conditions, and do so in such a way
that a definite body is the carrier of the process. This is the case in the
manufacture of sulphuric acid by the burning of sulphur. In this process
sulphur dioxide, SO<sub>2</sub>, is produced, and when steam and nitric acid
are added, the sulphur dioxide absorbs hydrogen and oxygen and is converted
into sulphuric acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The nitric acid gives off
oxygen and is reduced to nitric oxide; this nitric oxide immediately absorbs
new oxygen from the air and is transformed into the higher oxides of nitrogen,
but only to transfer this oxygen immediately to sulphur dioxide and to go
through the same process again; so that theoretically an infinitely small
quantity of nitric acid should suffice to change an unlimited quantity of
sulphur dioxide, oxygen and water into sulphuric acid. — Exchange of
matter also takes place in the passage of fluids through dead organic and even
inorganic membranes, as in Traube's artificial cells. <a href="footnotes.html#n45" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[45]</sup></a> Here too it is clear
that we cannot get any further by means of exchange of matter; for the peculiar
exchange of matter which is to explain life needs itself to be explained
through life. We must therefore try some other way.</p>
<a id="299"></a>
<p><i>Life is the mode of existence of albuminous bodies</i>, and this mode
of existence essentially consists in the constant self-renewal of the chemical
constituents of these bodies.</p>
<a id="300"></a>
<p>The term albuminous body is used here in the sense in which it is employed
in modern chemistry, which includes under this name all bodies constituted
similarly to ordinary white of egg, otherwise also known as protein substances.
The name is an unhappy one, because ordinary white of egg plays the most
lifeless and passive role of all the substances related to it, since, together
with the yolk, it is merely food for the developing embryo. But while so little
is yet known of the chemical composition of albuminous bodies, this name is
better than any other because it is more general.</p>
<a id="301"></a>
<p>Wherever we find life we find it associated with an albuminous body, and
wherever we find an albuminous body not in process of dissolution, there also
without exception we find phenomena of life. Undoubtedly, the presence of other
chemical combinations is also necessary in a living body in order to induce
particular differentiations of these phenomena of life; but they are not
requisite for naked life, except in so far as they enter the body as food and
are transformed into albumen. The lowest living beings known to us are in fact
nothing but simple particles of albumen, and they already exhibit all the
essential phenomena of life.</p>
<a id="302"></a>
<p>But what are these universal phenomena of life which are equally present
among all living organisms? Above all the fact that an albuminous body absorbs
other appropriate substances from its environment and assimilates them, while
other, older parts of the body disintegrate and are excreted. Other non-living,
bodies also change, disintegrate or enter into combinations in the natural
course of events; but in doing this they cease to be what they were. A
weather-worn rock is no longer a rock, metal which oxidises turns into rust.
But what with non-living bodies is the cause of destruction, with albumen is
<i>the fundamental condition of existence.</i> From the moment when this
uninterrupted metamorphosis of its constituents, this constant alternation of
nutrition and excretion, no longer takes place in an albuminous body, the
albuminous body itself comes to an end, it decomposes, that is, <i>dies</i>.
Life, the mode of existence of an albuminous body, therefore consists primarily
in the fact that every moment it is itself and at the same time something else;
and this does not take place as the result of a process to which it is
subjected from without, as is the way in which this can occur also in the case
of inanimate bodies. On the contrary, life, the metabolism which takes place
through nutrition and excretion, is a self-implementing process which is
inherent in, native to, its bearer, albumen, without which the latter cannot
exist. And hence it follows that if chemistry ever succeeds in producing
albumen artificially, this albumen must show the phenomena of life, however
weak these may be. It is certainly open to question whether chemistry will at
the same time also discover the right food for this albumen.</p>
<a id="303"></a>
<p>From the metabolism which takes place through nutrition and excretion, as
the essential function of albumen, and from its peculiar plasticity proceed
also all the other most simple factors of life: irritability, which is already
included in the mutual interaction between the albumen and its food;
contractibility, which is shown, even at a very low stage, in the consumption
of food; the possibility of growth, which in the lowest forms includes
propagation by fission; internal movement, without which neither the
consumption nor the assimilation of food is possible.</p>
<a id="304"></a>
<p>Our definition of life is naturally very inadequate, inasmuch as, far from
including <i>all</i> the phenomena of life, it has to be limited to those
which are the most common and the simplest. From a scientific standpoint all
definitions are of little value. In order to gain an exhaustive knowledge of
what life is, we should have to go through all the forms in which it appears,
from the lowest to the highest. But for ordinary usage such definitions are
very convenient and in places cannot well be dispensed with; moreover, they can
do no harm, provided their inevitable deficiencies are not forgotten.</p>
<a id="305"></a>
<p>But back to Herr Dühring. When things are faring badly with him in the
sphere of earthly biology, he knows where to find consolation; he takes refuge
in his starry heaven.</p>
<a id="306"></a>
<p class="quoted">“It is not merely the special apparatus of an organ of
sensation, but the whole objective world, which is adapted to the production of
pleasure and pain. For this reason we take it for granted that the antithesis
between pleasure and pain, and moreover <i>exactly</i>, in the form with
which we are familiar, is a universal antithesis, and must be represented
<i>in the various worlds of the universe</i> by essentially homogeneous
feelings.... This conformity, however, is of no <i>little</i> significance,
for it is the key to the <i>universe of sensations...</i>. Hence the
subjective cosmic world is to us not much more unfamiliar than the objective.
The constitution of both spheres must be conceived according to one concordant
type, and in this we have the beginnings of a science of consciousness whose
range is wider than merely terrestrial” {D. Ph. 139-40}.</p>
<a id="307"></a>
<p class="fst">What do a few gross blunders in terrestrial natural science
matter to the man who carries in his pocket the key to the universe of
sensations? <i>Allons donc!</i> <span class="context">[“Well, really!”]</span></p>

<a id="c2"></a>
<h1>II. Theory of Force</h1>
<p class="quoted">“In my system, the relation between general politics
and the forms of economic law is determined in so definite a way and at the
same time a way so <i>original</i> that it would not be superfluous, in order
to facilitate study, to make special reference to this point. The formation of
<i>political</i> relationships is <i>historically the fundamental
thing</i>, and instances of <i>economic</i> dependence are only
<i>effects</i> or special cases, and are consequently always <i>facts of a
second order.</i> Some of the newer socialist systems take as their guiding
principle the conspicuous semblance of a completely reverse relationship, in
that they assume that political phenomena are subordinate to and, as it were,
grow out of the economic conditions. It is true that these effects of the
second order do exist as such, and are most clearly perceptible at the present
time; but the <i>primary</i> must be sought in <i>direct political
force</i> and not in any indirect economic power” {D. Ph. 538}. <a id="040"></a></p>
<p class="fst">This conception is also expressed in another passage, in which
Herr Dühring <a id="041"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“starts from the principle that the political
conditions are the decisive cause of the economic situation and that the
reverse relationship represents only a reaction of a second order ... so long
as the political grouping is not taken for its own sake, as the starting-point,
but is treated merely as a <i>stomach-filling agency</i>, one must have a
portion of reaction stowed away in one's mind, however radical a socialist and
revolutionary one may seem to be” {D. K. G. 230-31}. <a id="042"></a></p>
<p class="fst">That is Herr Dühring's theory. In this and in many other
passages it is simply set up, decreed, so to speak. Nowhere in the three fat
tomes is there even the slightest attempt to prove it or to disprove the
opposite point of view. And even if the arguments for it were as plentiful as
blackberries, Herr Dühring would give us none of them. For the whole affair has
been already proved through the famous original sin, when Robinson Crusoe made
Friday his slave. That was an act of force, hence a political act. And inasmuch
as this enslavement was the starting-point and the basic fact underlying all
past history and inoculated it with the original sin of injustice, so much so
that in the later periods it was only softened down and “transformed into
the more indirect forms of economic dependence” {D. C. 19}; and inasmuch
as “property founded on force” {D. Ph. 242}, which has asserted
itself right up to the present day, is likewise based on this original act of
enslavement, it is clear that all economic phenomena must be explained by
political causes, that is, by force. And anyone who is not satisfied with that
is a reactionary in disguise. <a id="043"></a></p>
<p>We must first point out that only one with as much self-esteem as Herr
Dühring could regard this view as so very “original”, which it is
not in the least. The idea that political acts, grand performances of state,
are decisive in history is as old as written history itself, and is the main
reason why so little material has been preserved for us in regard to the really
progressive evolution of the peoples which has taken place quietly, in the
background, behind these noisy scenes on the stage. This idea dominated all the
conceptions of historians in the past, and the first blow against it was
delivered only by the French bourgeois historians of the Restoration period <a href="footnotes.html#n69" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[69]</sup></a>; the only
“original” thing about it is that Herr Dühring once again knows
nothing of all this. <a id="044"></a></p>
<p>Furthermore: even if we assume for a moment that Herr Dühring is right in
saying that all past history can be traced back to the enslavement of man by
man, we are still very far from having got to the bottom of the matter. For the
question then arises: how did Crusoe come to enslave Friday? Just for the fun
of it? By no means. On the contrary, we see that Friday “is compelled to
render <i>economic</i> service as a slave or as a mere tool and is maintained
also only as a tool” {D. C. 9}. Crusoe enslaved Friday only in order that
Friday should work for Crusoe's benefit. And how can he derive any benefit for
himself from Friday's labour? Only through Friday producing by his labour more
of the necessaries of life than Crusoe has to give him to keep him fit to work.
Crusoe, therefore, in violation of Herr Dühring's express orders, “takes
the political grouping” arising out of Friday’s enslavement
“not for its own sake, as the starting-point, but merely <i>as a
stomach-filling agency</i>”; and now let him see to it that he gets
along with his lord and master, Dühring <a id="045"></a></p>
<p>The childish example specially selected by Herr Dühring in order to prove
that force is “historically the fundamental thing”, therefore,
proves that force is only the means, and that the aim, on the contrary, is
economic advantage. And “the more fundamental” the aim is than the
means used to secure it, the more fundamental in history is the economic side
of the relationship than the political side. The example therefore proves
precisely the opposite of what it was supposed to prove. And as in the case of
Crusoe and Friday, so in all cases of domination and subjection up to the
present day. Subjugation has always been—to use Herr Dühring's elegant
expression—a “stomach-filling agency” (taking stomach-filling
in a very wide sense), but never and nowhere a political grouping established
“for its own sake”. It takes a Herr Dühring to be able to imagine
that state taxes are only “effects of a second order”, or that the
present-day political grouping of the ruling bourgeoisie and the ruled
proletariat has come into existence “for its own sake”, and not as
a “stomach-filling agency” for the ruling bourgeois, that is to
say, for the sake of making profits and accumulating capital. <a id="046"></a></p>
<p>However, let us get back again to our two men. Crusoe, “sword in
hand” {D. C. 23}, makes Friday his slave. But in order to manage this,
Crusoe needs something else besides his sword. Not everyone can make use of a
slave. In order to be able to make use of a slave, one must possess two kinds
of things: first, the instruments and material for his slave’s labour;
and secondly, the means of bare subsistence for him. Therefore, before slavery
becomes possible, a certain level of production must already have been reached
and a certain inequality of distribution must already have appeared. And for
slave-labour to become the dominant mode of production in the whole of a
society, an even far higher increase in production, trade and accumulation of
wealth was essential. In the ancient primitive communities with common
ownership of the land, slavery either did not exist at all or played only a
very subordinate role. It was the same in the originally peasant city of Rome;
but when Rome became a “world city” and Italic landownership came
more and more into the hands of a numerically small class of enormously rich
proprietors, the peasant population was supplanted by a population of slaves.
If at the time of the Persian wars the number of slaves in Corinth rose to
460,000 and in Aegina to 470,000 and there were ten slaves to every freeman, <a href="footnotes.html#n70" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[70]</sup></a> something else
besides “force” was required, namely, a highly developed arts and
handicraft industry and an extensive commerce. Slavery in the United States of
America was based far less on force than on the English cotton industry; in
those districts where no cotton was grown or which, unlike the border states,
did not breed slaves for the cotton-growing states, it died out of itself
without any force being used, simply because it did not pay. <a id="047"></a></p>
<p>Hence, by calling property as it exists today property founded on force, and
by characterising it as <a id="048"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“that form of domination <i>at the root of which
lies</i> not merely the exclusion of fellow-men from the use of the natural
means of subsistence, but also, what is far more important, the subjugation of
man to make him do servile work” {5}, <a id="049"></a></p>
<p class="fst">Herr Dühring is making the whole relationship stand on its head.
The subjugation of a man to make him do servile work, in all its forms,
presupposes that the subjugator has at his disposal the instruments of labour
with the help of which alone he is able to employ the person placed in bondage,
and in the case of slavery, in addition, the means of subsistence which enable
him to keep his slave alive. In all cases, therefore, it presupposes the
possession of a certain amount of property, in excess of the average. How did
this property come into existence? In any case it is clear that it may in fact
have been robbed, and therefore may be based on <i>force</i>, but that this
is by no means necessary. It may have been got by labour, it may have been
stolen, or it may have been obtained by trade or by fraud. In fact, it must
have been obtained by labour before there was any possibility of its being
robbed. <a id="050"></a></p>
<p>Private property by no means makes its appearance in history as the result
of robbery or force. On the contrary. It already existed, though limited to
certain objects, in the ancient primitive communities of all civilised peoples.
It developed into the form of commodities within these communities, at first
through barter with foreigners. The more the products of the community assumed
the commodity form, that is, the less they were produced for their producers'
own use and the more for the purpose of exchange, and the more the original
spontaneously evolved division of labour was superseded by exchange also within
the community, the more did inequality develop in the property owned by the
individual members of the community, the more deeply was the ancient common
ownership of the land undermined, and the more rapidly did the commune develop
towards its dissolution and transformation into a village of smallholding
peasants. For thousands of years Oriental despotism and the changing rule of
conquering nomad peoples were unable to injure these old communities; the
gradual destruction of their primitive home industry by the competition of
products of large-scale industry brought these communities nearer and nearer to
dissolution. Force was as little involved in this process as in the dividing
up, still taking place now, of the land held in common by the village
communities [<i>Gehöferschaften</i>] on the Mosel and in the Hochwald; the
peasants simply find it to their advantage that the private ownership of land
should take the place of common ownership. Even the formation of a primitive
aristocracy, as in the case of the Celts, the Germans and the Indian Punjab,
took place on the basis of common ownership of the land, and at first was not
based in any way on force, but on voluntariness and custom. Wherever private
property evolved it was the result of altered relations of production and
exchange, in the interest of increased production and in furtherance of
intercourse—hence as a result of economic causes. Force plays no part in
this at all. Indeed, it is clear that the institution of private property must
already be in existence for a robber to be able to <i>appropriate</i> another
person's property, and that therefore force may be able to change the
possession of, but cannot create, private property as such. <a id="051"></a></p>
<p>Nor can we use either force or property founded on force in explanation of
the <span class="duhring">“subjugation of man to make him do servile
work”</span> in its most modern form—wage-labour. We have already
mentioned the role played in the dissolution of the ancient communities, that
is, in the direct or indirect general spread of private property, by the
transformation of the products of labour into commodities, their production not
for consumption by those who produced them, but for exchange. Now in
<i>Capital</i>, Marx proved with absolute clarity—and Herr Dühring
carefully avoids even the slightest reference to this—that at a certain
stage of development, the production of commodities becomes transformed into
capitalist production, and that at this stage “the laws of appropriation
or of private property, laws that are based on the production and circulation
of commodities, become by their own inner and inexorable dialectic changed into
their opposite. The exchange of equivalents, the original operation with which
we started, has now become turned round in such a way that there is only an
apparent exchange. This is owing to the fact, first, that the capital which is
exchanged for labour-power is itself but a portion of the product of
others’ labour appropriated without an equivalent; and, secondly, that
this capital must not only be replaced by its producer, but replaced together
with an added surplus... At first property seemed to us to be based on a man's
own labour... Now, however” (at the end of Marx's analysis)
“property turns out to be the right, on the part of the capitalist, to
appropriate the unpaid labour of others, and to be the impossibility, on the
part of the labourer, of appropriating his own product. The separation of
property from labour has become the necessary consequence of a law that
apparently originated in their identity.” In other words, even if we
exclude all possibility of robbery, force and fraud, even if we assume that all
private property was originally based on the owner's own labour, and that
throughout the whole subsequent process there was only exchange of equal values
for equal values, the progressive development of production and exchange
nevertheless brings us of necessity to the present capitalist mode of
production, to the monopolisation of the means of production and the means of
subsistence in the hands of the one, numerically small, class, to the
degradation into propertyless proletarians of the other class, constituting the
immense majority, to the periodic alternation of speculative production booms
and commercial crises and to the whole of the present anarchy of production.
The whole process can be explained by purely economic causes; at no point
whatever are robbery, force, the state or political interference of any kind
necessary. <span class="duhring">“Property founded on force”</span>
{D. C. 4} proves here also to be nothing but the phrase of a braggart intended
to cover up his lack of understanding of the real course of things. <a id="052"></a></p>
<p>This course of things, expressed historically, is the history of the
development of the bourgeoisie. If <span class="duhring">“political
conditions are the decisive cause of the economic situation”</span> {D.
K. G. 230-31}, then the modern bourgeoisie cannot have developed in struggle
with feudalism, but must be the latter's voluntarily begotten pet child.
Everyone knows that what took place was the opposite. Originally an oppressed
estate liable to pay dues to the ruling feudal nobility, recruited from all
manner of serfs and villains, the burghers conquered one position after another
in their continuous struggle with the nobility, and finally, in the most highly
developed countries, took power in its stead; in France, by directly
overthrowing the nobility; in England, by making it more and more bourgeois and
incorporating it as their own ornamental head. And how did they accomplish
this? Simply through a change in the “economic situation”,
which sooner or later, voluntarily or as the outcome of combat, was followed by
a change in the political conditions. The struggle of the bourgeoisie against
the feudal nobility is the struggle of town against country, industry against
landed property, money economy against natural economy; and the decisive weapon
of the bourgeoisie in this struggle was its means of <i>economic</i> power,
constantly increasing through the development of industry, first handicraft,
and then, at a later stage, progressing to manufacture, and through the
expansion of commerce. During the whole of this struggle political force was on
the side of the nobility, except for a period when the Crown played the
bourgeoisie against the nobility, in order to keep one estate in check by means
of the other <a href="footnotes.html#n71" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[71]</sup></a>; but
from the moment when the bourgeoisie, still politically powerless, began to
grow dangerous owing to its increasing economic power, the Crown resumed its
alliance with the nobility, and by so doing called forth the bourgeois
revolution, first in England and then in France. The “political
conditions” in France had remained unaltered, while the
“economic situation” had outgrown them. Judged by his
political status the nobleman was everything, the burgher nothing; but judged
by his social position the burgher now formed the most important class in the
state, while the nobleman had been shorn of all his social functions and was
now only drawing payment, in the revenues that came to him, for these functions
which had disappeared. Nor was that all. Bourgeois production in its entirety
was still hemmed in by the feudal political forms of the Middle Ages, which
this production—not only manufacture, but even handicraft
industry—had long outgrown; it had remained hemmed in by all the
thousandfold guild privileges and local and provincial customs barriers which
had become mere irritants and fetters on production. The bourgeois revolution
put an end to this. Not, however, by adjusting the economic situation to suit
the political conditions, in accordance with Herr Dühring’s precept—this
was precisely what the nobles and the Crown had been vainly trying to do for
years—but by doing the opposite, by casting aside the old mouldering
political rubbish and creating political conditions in which the new “economic
situation” could exist and develop. And in this political and legal atmosphere
which was suited to its needs it developed brilliantly, so brilliantly that the
bourgeoisie has already come close to occupying the position held by the
nobility in 1789: it is becoming more and more not only socially superfluous,
but a social hindrance; it is more and more becoming separated from productive
activity, and, like the nobility in the past, becoming more and more a class
merely drawing revenues; and it has accomplished this revolution in its own
position and the creation of a new class, the proletariat, without any
hocus-pocus of force whatever, in a purely economic way. Even more: it did not
in any way will this result of its own actions land activities—on the
contrary, this result established itself with irresistible force, against the
will and contrary to the intentions of the bourgeoisie; its own productive
forces have grown beyond its control, and, as if necessitated by a law of
nature, are driving the whole of bourgeois society towards ruin, or revolution.
And if the bourgeois now make their appeal to force in order to save the
collapsing “economic situation” from the final crash, this only shows that they
are labouring under the same delusion as Herr Dühring: the delusion that <span class="duhring">“political conditions are the decisive cause of the economic
situation”</span>; this only shows that they imagine, just as Herr Dühring
does, that by making use of “the primary”, “the direct political force”, they
can remodel those <span class="duhring">“facts of the second order”</span> {D.
Ph. 538}, the economic situation and its inevitable development; and that
therefore the economic consequences of the steam-engine and the modern
machinery driven by it, of world trade and the banking and credit developments
of the present day, can be blown out of existence by them with Krupp guns and
Mauser rifles. <a href="footnotes.html#n72" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[72]</sup></a> <a id="053"></a></p>

<h1>X. Morality and Law.<br>
Equality</h1>
<a id="342"></a>
<p class="fst">We have already had more than one occasion to make ourselves
acquainted with Herr Dühring’s method. It consists in dissecting each
group of objects of knowledge to what is claimed to be their simplest elements,
applying to these elements similarly simple and what are claimed to be
self-evident axioms, and then continuing to operate with the aid of the results
so obtained. Even a problem in the sphere of social life</p>
<a id="343"></a>
<p class="quoted">“is to be decided axiomatically, in accordance with
particular, simple basic forms, just as if we were dealing with the simple ...
basic forms of mathematics” {D. Ph. 224}.</p>
<a id="344"></a>
<p class="fst">And thus the application of the mathematical method to history,
morals and law is to give us also in these fields mathematical certainty of the
truth of the results obtained, to characterise them as genuine, immutable
truths.</p>
<a id="345"></a>
<p>This is only giving a new twist to the old favourite ideological method,
also known as the a <i>priori</i> method, which consists in ascertaining the
properties of an object, by logical deduction from the concept of the object,
instead of from the object itself. First the concept of the object is
fabricated from the object; then the spit is turned round, and the object is
measured by its reflexion, the concept. The object is then to conform to the
concept, not the concept to the object. With Herr Dühring the simplest
elements, the ultimate abstractions he can reach, do service for the concept,
which does not alter matters; these simplest elements are at best of a purely
conceptual nature. The philosophy of reality, therefore, proves here again to
be pure ideology, the deduction of reality not from itself but from a
concept.</p>
<a id="346"></a>
<p>And when such an ideologist constructs morality and law from the concept, or
the so-called simplest elements of “society”, instead of from the
real social relations of the people round him, what material is then available
for this construction? Material clearly of two kinds: first, the meagre residue
of real content which may possibly survive in the abstractions from which he
starts and, secondly, the content which our ideologist once more introduces
from his own consciousness. And what does he find in his consciousness? For the
most part, moral and juridical notions which are a more or less accurate
expression (positive or negative, corroborative or antagonistic) of the social
and political relations amidst which he lives; perhaps also ideas drawn from
the literature on the subject; and, as a final possibility, some personal
idiosyncrasies. Our ideologist may turn and twist as he likes, but the
historical reality which he cast out at the door comes in again at the window,
and while he thinks he is framing a doctrine of morals and law for all times
and for all worlds, he is in fact only fashioning an image of the conservative
or revolutionary tendencies of his day — an image which is distorted
because it has been torn from its real basis and, like a reflection in a
concave mirror, is standing on its head.</p>
<a id="347"></a>
<p>Herr Dühring thus dissects society into its simplest elements, and discovers
in doing so that the simplest society consists of at least two people. With
these two people he then proceeds to operate axiomatically. And so the basic
moral axiom naturally presents itself:</p>
<a id="348"></a>
<p class="quoted">“Two human wills are as such <i>entirely equal</i> to
each other, and in the first place the one can demand nothing positive of the
other” {D. Ph. 200}. This “characterises the basic form of moral
justice” {201}, and also that of legal justice, for “we need only
the wholly simple and elementary relation of <i>two persons</i> for the
development of the fundamental concepts of law” {228}.</p>
<a id="349"></a>
<p class="fst">That two people or two human wills are as such <i>entirely</i>
equal to each other is not only not an axiom but is even a great exaggeration.
In the first place, two people, even as such, may be unequal in sex, and this
simple fact leads us on at once to the idea that the simplest elements of
society — if we accept this childishness for a moment — are not two
men, but a man and a woman, who found a <i>family</i>, the simplest and first
form of association for the purpose of production. But this cannot in any way
suit Herr Dühring. For on the one hand the two founders of society must be made
as equal as possible; and secondly even Herr Dühring could not succeed in
constructing from the primitive family the moral and legal equality of man and
woman. One thing or the other: either the Dühringian social molecule, by the
multiplication of which the whole of society is to be built up, is doomed
beforehand to disaster, because two men can never by themselves bring a child
into the world; or we must conceive them as two heads of families. And in that
case the whole simple basic scheme is turned into its opposite: instead of the
equality of people it proves at most the equality of heads of families, and as
women are not considered, it further proves that they are subordinate.</p>
<a id="350"></a>
<p>We have now to make an unpleasant announcement to the reader: that from this
point on for some considerable time he will not get rid of these famous two
men. In the sphere of social relations they play a similar role to that
hitherto played by the inhabitants of other celestial bodies, with whom it is
to be hoped we have now finished. Whenever a question of economics, politics
etc., is to be solved, the two men instantly march up and settle the matter in
the twinkling of an eye <span class="duhring">“axiomatically”</span> {224}. An excellent,
creative and system-creating discovery on the part of our philosopher of
reality. But unfortunately, if we want to pay due regard to truth, the two men
are not his discovery. They are the common property of the whole eighteenth
century. They are already to be found in Rousseau's discourse on inequality
(1754), <a href="footnotes.html#n47" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[47]</sup></a> where, by
the way, they prove axiomatically the opposite of Herr Dühring's contentions.
They play a leading part with the economists, from Adam Smith to Ricardo; but
in these they are at least unequal in that each of the two carries on a
different trade — as a rule one is a hunter and the other a fisherman
— and that they mutually exchange their products. Besides, throughout the
eighteenth century, they serve in the main as a purely illustrative example,
and Herr Dühring’s originality consists only in that he elevates this
method of illustration into a basic method for all social science and a measure
of all historical forms. Certainly it would be impossible to simplify further
the <span class="duhring">“strictly scientific conception of things and
men”</span> {387}.</p>
<a id="351"></a>
<p>In order to establish the fundamental axiom that two people and their wills
are absolutely equal to each other and that neither lords it over the other, we
cannot use any couple of men at random. They must be two people who are so
thoroughly free from all reality, from all national, economic, political and
religious relations which are found in the world, from all sexual and personal
peculiarities, that nothing is left of either of them beyond the mere concept:
human being, and then they are of course <span class="duhring">“entirely
equal”</span>. They are therefore two complete phantoms conjured up by
that very Herr Dühring who is everywhere scenting and denouncing
“spiritistic” tendencies. These two phantoms are of course obliged
to do everything which the man who conjured them into existence wants them to
do, and for that very reason all their artifices are of no interest whatever to
the rest of the world.</p>
<a id="352"></a>
<p>But let us pursue Herr Dühring’s axiomatics a little further. The two
wills can demand nothing positive of each other. If nevertheless one of them
does so, and has its way by force, this gives rise to a state of injustice; and
this fundamental scheme serves Herr Dühring to explain injustice, tyranny,
servitude — in short, the whole reprehensible history of the past. Now
Rousseau, in the essay referred to above, had already made use of two men to
prove, likewise axiomatically, the very opposite: that is, given two men, A
cannot enslave B by force, but only by putting B into a position in which the
latter cannot do without A, a conception which, however, is much too
materialistic for Herr Dühring. Let us put the same thing in a slightly
different way. Two shipwrecked people are alone on an island, and form a
society. Their wills are, formally, entirely equal, and this is acknowledged by
both. But from a material standpoint there is great inequality. A has
determination and energy, B is irresolute, lazy and flabby. A is quick-witted,
B stupid. How long will it be before A regularly imposes his will on B, first
by persuasion, subsequently by dint of habit, but always in form voluntarily?
Servitude remains servitude, whether the voluntary form is retained or is
trampled underfoot. Voluntary entry into servitude was known throughout the
Middle Ages, in Germany until after the Thirty Years' War. <a href="footnotes.html#n48" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[48]</sup></a> When serfdom was
abolished in Prussia after the defeats of 1806 and 1807, and with it the
obligation of the gracious lords to provide for their subjects in need, illness
and old age, the peasants petitioned the king asking to be left in servitude
— for otherwise who would look after them when in distress? The two-men
scheme is therefore just as “appropriate” to inequality and
servitude as to equality and mutual help; and inasmuch as we are forced, on
pain of extinction of society, to assume that they are heads of families,
hereditary servitude is also provided for in the idea from the start.</p>
<a id="353"></a>
<p>But let this entire matter rest for the moment. Let us assume that Herr
Dühring’s axiomatics have convinced us and that we are enthusiastic
supporters of the entire equality of rights as between the two wills, of <span class="duhring">“general human sovereignty”</span> {D. Ph. 229}, of
the “sovereignty of the individual” {268} — veritable verbal
colossi, compared with whom Stirner's “Ego” together with his Own
<a href="footnotes.html#n49" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[49]</sup></a> is a mere dwarf,
although he also could claim a modest part in them. Well, then, we are now all
<i>entirely equal</i> {200} and independent. All? No, not quite all.</p>
<a id="354"></a>
<p class="quoted">There are also cases of “permissible dependence”,
but these can be explained “on grounds which are to be sought not in the
activity of the two wills as such, but in a third sphere, as for example in
regard to children, in their inadequate self-determination” {200}.</p>
<a id="355"></a>
<p class="fst">Indeed! The grounds of dependence are not to be sought in the
activity of the two wills as such! Naturally not, for the activity of one of
the wills is actually restricted. But in a third sphere! And what is this third
sphere? The concrete determination of one, the subjected, will as inadequate!
Our philosopher of reality has so far departed from reality that, as against
the abstract term “will”, which is devoid of content, he regards
the real content, the characteristic determination of this will, as a
“third sphere”. Be that as it may, we are obliged to state that the
equality of rights has an exception. It does not hold good for a will afflicted
with inadequate self-determination. <i>Retreat No. 1</i>.</p>
<a id="356"></a>
<p>To proceed.</p>
<a id="357"></a>
<p class="quoted">“Where beast and man are blended in one person the
question may be asked, on behalf of a second, entirely human, person, whether
his mode of action should be the same as if persons who, so to speak, are only
human were confronting each other {201} ... our hypothesis of two morally
unequal persons, one of whom in some sense or other has something of the real
beast in his character, is therefore the typical basic form for all relations
which, in accordance with this difference, may come about ... within and
between groups of people” {202}.</p>
<a id="358"></a>
<p class="fst">And now let the reader see for himself the pitiful diatribe that
follows these clumsy subterfuges, in which Herr Dühring turns and twists like a
Jesuit priest in order to determine casuistically how far the human man can go
against the bestial man, how far he may show distrust and employ stratagems and
harsh, even terrorist means, as well as deception against him, without himself
deviating in any way from immutable morality.</p>
<a id="359"></a>
<p>So, when two persons are <span class="duhring">“morally
unequal”</span> {202}, there again is no longer equality. But then it was
surely not worth while to conjure up two entirely equal people, for there are
no two persons who are morally entirely equal. — But the inequality is
supposed to consist in this: that one person is human and the other has a
streak of the beast in him. It is, however, inherent in the descent of man from
the animal world that he can never entirely rid himself of the beast, so that
it can always be only a question of more or less, of a difference in the degree
of bestiality or of humanity. A division of mankind into two sharply
differentiated groups, into human men and beast men, into good and bad, sheep
and goats, is only found — apart from the philosophy of reality —
in Christianity, which quite logically also has its judge of the universe to
make the separation. But who is to be the judge of the universe in the
philosophy of reality? Presumably the procedure will have to be the same as in
Christian practice, in which the pious lambs themselves assume the office of
judge of the universe in relation to their mundane goat-neighbours, and
discharge this duty with notorious success. The sect of philosophers of
reality, if it ever comes into being, will assuredly not yield precedence in
this respect to the pious of the land. This, however, is of no concern to us;
what interests us is the admission that, as a result of the moral inequality
between men, equality has vanished once more. <i>Retreat No. 2.</i></p>
<a id="360"></a>
<p>But, again, let us proceed.</p>
<a id="361"></a>
<p class="quoted">“If one acts in accordance with truth and science, and
the other in accordance with some superstition or prejudice, then ... as a rule
mutual interference must occur {216}... At a certain degree of incompetence,
brutality or perversity of character, conflict is always inevitable... It is
not only children and madmen in relation to whom the ultimate resource is
<i>force</i>. The character of whole natural groups and cultured classes in
mankind may make the <i>subjection</i> of their will, which is hostile
because of its perversity, an inevitable necessity, in order to guide it back
to the ties held in common. Even in such cases the alien will is still
recognised as <i>having equal rights;</i> but the perversity of its injurious
and hostile activity has provoked an <i>equalisation</i>, and if it is
subjected to force, it is only reaping the reaction to its own
unrighteousness” {D. Ph. 217}. </p>
<a id="362"></a>
<p class="fst">So not only moral but also mental inequality is enough to remove
the “entire equality” of the two wills and to call into being a
morality by which all the infamous deeds of civilised robber states against
backward peoples, down to the Russian atrocities in Turkestan, can be
justified. When in the summer of 1873, General Kaufmann ordered the Tatar tribe
of the Yomuds to be attacked, their tents to be burnt and their wives and
children butchered — &amp;ldquo;in the good old Caucasian way&amp;rdquo;,
as the order was worded — he, too, declared that the subjection of the
hostile, because perverted, will of the Yomuds, with the object of guiding it
back to the ties held in common, had become an inevitable necessity, that the
means employed by him were best suited to the purpose, <a href="footnotes.html#n50" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[50]</sup></a> and that whoever
willed the end must also will the means. Only he was not so cruel as to insult
the Yomuds on top of it all and to say that it was just by massacring them for
purposes of equalisation that he was recognising their will as having equal
rights. And once again in this conflict it is the elect, those who claim to be
acting in accordance with truth and science and therefore in the last resort
the philosophers of reality, who have to decide what are superstition,
prejudice, brutality and perversity of character and when force and subjection
are necessary for purposes of equalisation. Equality, therefore, is now —
equalisation by force; and the second will is recognised by the first to have
equal rights through subjection. <i>Retreat No. 3</i>, here already
degenerating into ignominious flight.</p>
<a id="363"></a>
<p>Incidentally, the phrase that the alien will is recognised as having equal
right precisely through equalisation by means of force is only a distortion of
the Hegelian theory, according to which punishment is the right of the
criminal;</p>
<a id="364"></a>
<p class="quoted">“punishment is regarded as containing the
criminal’s right and hence by being punished he is honoured as a rational
being” (<i>Rechtsphilosophie</i>, § 100, Note).</p>
<a id="365"></a>
<p class="fst">With that we can break off. It would be superfluous to follow
Herr Dühring further in his piecemeal destruction of the equality which he set
up so axiomatically {224}, of his general human sovereignty {229} and so on; to
observe how he manages to set up society with his two men, but in order to
create the state he requires a third because — to put the matter briefly
— without a third no majority decisions can be arrived at, and without
these, and so also without the rule of the majority over the minority, no state
can exist; and then how he gradually steers into calmer waters where he
constructs his socialitarian state of the future where one fine morning we
shall have the honour to look him up. We have sufficiently observed that the
entire equality of the two wills exists only so long as these two wills
<i>will nothing;</i> that as soon as they cease to be human wills as such,
and are transformed into real, individual wills, into the wills of two real
people, equality comes to an end; that childhood, madness, so-called
bestiality, supposed superstition, alleged prejudice and assumed incapacity on
the one hand, and fancied humanity and knowledge of truth and science on the
other hand — that therefore every difference in the quality of the two
wills and in that of the intelligence associated with them — justifies an
inequality of treatment which may go as far as subjection. What more can we
ask, when Herr Dühring has so deep-rootedly, from the ground up, demolished his
own edifice of equality?</p>
<a id="366"></a>
<p>But even though we have finished with Herr Dühring’s shallow, botched
treatment of the idea of equality, this does not mean that we have finished
with the idea itself, which especially thanks to Rousseau played a theoretical,
and during and since the great revolution a practical political role, and even
today still plays an important agitational role in the socialist movement of
almost every country. The establishment of its scientific content will also
determine its value for proletarian agitation.</p>
<a id="367"></a>
<p>The idea that all men, as men, have something in common, and that to that
extent they are equal, is of course primeval. But the modern demand for
equality is something entirely different from that; this consists rather in
deducing from that common quality of being human, from that equality of men as
men, a claim to equal political resp. social status for all human beings, or at
least for all citizens of a state or all members of a society. Before that
original conception of relative equality could lead to the conclusion that men
should have equal rights in the state and in society, before that conclusion
could even appear to be something natural and self-evident, thousands of years
had to pass and did pass. In the most ancient, primitive communities, equality
of rights could apply at most to members of the community; women, slaves and
foreigners were excluded from this equality as a matter of course. Among the
Greeks and Romans the inequalities of men were of much greater importance than
their equality in any respect. It would necessarily have seemed insanity to the
ancients that Greeks and barbarians, freemen and slaves, citizens and
peregrines, Roman citizens and Roman subjects (to use a comprehensive term)
should have a claim to equal political status. Under the Roman Empire all these
distinctions gradually disappeared, except the distinction between freemen and
slaves, and in this way there arose, for the freemen at least, that equality as
between private individuals on the basis of which Roman law developed —
the completest elaboration of law based on private property which we know. But
so long as the antithesis between freemen and slaves existed, there could be no
talk of drawing legal conclusions from general equality of <i>men;</i> we saw
this even recently, in the slave-owning states of the North American Union.</p>
<a id="368"></a>
<p>Christianity knew only <i>one</i> point in which all men were equal: that
all were equally born in original sin — which corresponded perfectly to
its character as the religion of the slaves and the oppressed. Apart from this
it recognised, at most, the equality of the elect, which however was only
stressed at the very beginning. The traces of community of goods which are also
found in the early stages of the new religion can be ascribed to solidarity
among the proscribed rather than to real equalitarian ideas. Within a very
short time the establishment of the distinction between priests and laymen put
an end even to this incipient Christian equality. — The overrunning of
Western Europe by the Germans abolished for centuries all ideas of equality,
through the gradual building up of such a complicated social and political
hierarchy as had never existed before. But at the same time the invasion drew
Western and Central Europe into the course of historical development, created
for the first time a compact cultural area, and within this area also for the
first time a system of predominantly national states exerting mutual influence
on each other and mutually holding each other in check. Thereby it prepared the
ground on which alone the question of the equal status of men, of the rights of
man, could at a later period be raised.</p>
<a id="369"></a>
<p>The feudal Middle Ages also developed in their womb the class which was
destined, in the course of its further development, to become the
standard-bearer of the modern demand for equality: the bourgeoisie. Originally
itself a feudal estate, the bourgeoisie developed the predominantly handicraft
industry and the exchange of products within feudal society to a relatively
high level, when at the end of the fifteenth century the great maritime
discoveries opened to it a new career of wider scope. Trade beyond the confines
of Europe, which had previously been carried on only between Italy and the
Levant, was now extended to America and India, and soon surpassed in importance
both the mutual exchange between the various European countries and the
internal trade within each individual country. American gold and silver flooded
Europe and forced its way like a disintegrating element into every fissure,
rent and pore of feudal society. Handicraft industry could no longer satisfy
the rising demand, in the leading industries of the most advanced countries it
was replaced by manufacture.</p>
<a id="370"></a>
<p>But this mighty revolution in the conditions of the economic life of society
was, however, not followed by any immediate corresponding change in its
political structure. The political order remained feudal, while society became
more and more bourgeois. Trade on a large scale, that is to say, particularly
international and, even more so, world trade, requires free owners of
commodities who are unrestricted in their movements and as such enjoy equal
rights; who may exchange their commodities on the basis of laws that are equal
for them all, at least in each particular place. The transition from handicraft
to manufacture presupposes the existence of a number of free workers —
free on the one hand from the fetters of the guild and on the other from the
means whereby they could themselves utilise their labour-power — workers
who can contract with the manufacturer for the hire of their labour-power, and
hence, as parties to the contract, have rights equal to his. And finally the
equality and equal status of all human labour, because and in so far as it is
<i>human</i> labour, found its unconscious but clearest expression in the law
of value of modern bourgeois political economy, according to which the value of
a commodity is measured by the socially necessary labour embodied in it. <a href="notes.html#n*3" target=_blank><sup class="enote">*3</sup></a> — However, where
economic relations required freedom and equality of rights, the political
system opposed them at every step with guild restrictions and special
privileges. Local privileges, differential duties, exceptional laws of all
kinds affected in trade not only foreigners and people living in the colonies,
but often enough also whole categories of the nationals of the country
concerned; everywhere and ever anew the privileges of the guilds barred the
development of manufacture. Nowhere was the road clear and the chances equal
for the bourgeois competitors — and yet that this be so was the prime and
ever more pressing demand.</p>
<a id="371"></a>
<p>The demand for liberation from feudal fetters and the establishment of
equality of rights by the abolition of feudal inequalities was bound soon to
assume wider dimensions, once the economic advance of society had placed it on
the order of the day. If it was raised in the interests of industry and trade,
it was also necessary to demand the same equality of rights for the great mass
of the peasantry who, in every degree of bondage, from total serfdom onwards,
were compelled to give the greater part of their labour-time to their gracious
feudal lord without compensation and in addition to render innumerable other
dues to him and to the state. On the other hand, it was inevitable that a
demand should also be made for the abolition of the feudal privileges, of the
freedom from taxation of the nobility, of the political privileges of the
separate estates. And as people were no longer living in a world empire such as
the Roman Empire had been, but in a system of independent states dealing with
each other on an equal footing and at approximately the same level of bourgeois
development, it was a matter of course that the demand for equality should
assume a general character reaching out beyond the individual state, that
freedom and equality should be proclaimed <i>human rights</i> And it is
significant of the specifically bourgeois character of these human rights that
the American constitution, <a href="footnotes.html#n51" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[51]</sup></a> the first to recognise the rights of man, in the
same breath confirms the slavery of the coloured races existing in America:
class privileges are proscribed, race privileges sanctified.</p>
<a id="372"></a>
<p>As is well known, however, from the moment when the bourgeoisie emerged from
feudal burgherdom, when this estate of the Middle Ages developed into a modern
class, it was always and inevitably accompanied by its shadow, the proletariat.
And in the same way bourgeois demands for equality were accompanied by
proletarian demands for equality. From the moment when the bourgeois demand for
the abolition of class <i>privileges</i> was put forward, alongside it
appeared the proletarian demand for the abolition of the <i>classes
themselves</i> — at first in religious form, leaning towards primitive
Christianity, and later drawing support from the bourgeois equalitarian
theories themselves. The proletarians took the bourgeoisie at its word:
equality must not be merely apparent, must not apply merely to the sphere of
the state, but must also be real, must also be extended to the social, economic
sphere. And especially since the French bourgeoisie, from the great revolution
on, brought civil equality to the forefront, the French proletariat has
answered blow for blow with the demand for social, economic equality, and
equality has become the battle-cry particularly of the French proletariat.</p>
<a id="373"></a>
<p>The demand for equality in the mouth of the proletariat has therefore a
double meaning. It is either — as was the case especially at the very
start, for example in the Peasant War <span class="context">[see Engels’
work <i>Peasant War in Germany</i>]</span>— the spontaneous reaction
against the crying social inequalities, against the contrast between rich and
poor, the feudal lords and their serfs, the surfeiters and the starving; as
such it is simply an expression of the revolutionary instinct, and finds its
justification in that, and in that only. Or, on the other hand, this demand has
arisen as a reaction against the bourgeois demand for equality, drawing more or
less correct and more far-reaching demands from this bourgeois demand, and
serving as an agitational means in order to stir up the workers against the
capitalists with the aid of the capitalists’ own assertions; and in this case
it stands or falls with bourgeois equality itself. In both cases the real
content of the proletarian demand for equality is the demand for the
<i>abolition of classes</i>. Any demand for equality which goes beyond that,
of necessity passes into absurdity. We have given examples of this, and shall
find enough additional ones when we come to Herr Dühring’s fantasies of the
future.</p>
<a id="374"></a>
<p>The idea of equality, both in its bourgeois and in its proletarian form, is
therefore itself a historical product, the creation of which required definite
historical conditions that in turn themselves presuppose a long previous
history. It is therefore anything but an eternal truth. And if today it is
taken for granted by the general public — in one sense or another —
if, as Marx says, it “already possesses the fixity of a popular prejudice”, <a href="footnotes.html#n52" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[52]</sup></a> this is not the
effect of its axiomatic truth, but the effect of the general diffusion and the
continued appropriateness of the ideas of the eighteenth century. If therefore
Herr Dühring is able without more ado to let his famous two men conduct their
economic relations on the basis of equality, this is so because it seems quite
natural to popular prejudice. And in fact Herr Dühring calls his philosophy
<i>natural</i> because it is derived solely from things which seem to him
quite natural. But why they seem natural to him is a question which of course
he does not ask.</p>

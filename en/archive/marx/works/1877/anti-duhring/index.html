<p class="information">Formerly known as <i>Herr Eugen Dühring's Revolution in
Science</i>, Engels’ <i>Anti-Dühring</i> is a popular and enduring
work which, as Engels wrote to Marx, was an attempt “to produce an
encyclopaedic survey of our conception of the philosophical, natural-science
and historical problems.”</p>
<a id="001"></a>
<p class="information">Marx and Engels first became aware of Professor Dühring
with his December 1867 review of <i>Capital</i>, published in
<i>Ergänzungsblätter</i>. They exchanged a series of letters about him from
January-March 1868.</p>
<p class="information">He was largely forgotten until the mid-1870s, at which
time Dühring entered Germany's political foreground. German Social-Democrats
were influenced by both his <i>Kritische Geschichte der Nationalökonomie und
des Sozialismus</i> and <i>Cursus der Philosophie als streng
wissenschaftlicher Weltanschauung und Lebensgestaltung</i>. Among his readers
were included Johann Most, Friedrich Wilhelm Fritzsche, Eduard Bernstein
— and even August Bebel for a brief period.</p>
<p class="information">In March 1874, the Social-Democratic Workers’
Party paper <i>Volksstaat</i> ran an anonymous article (actually penned by
Bebel) favorably reviewing one of Dühring's books.</p>
<p class="information">On both February 1 and April 21, 1875, Liebknecht
encouraged Engels to take Dühring head-on in the pages of the
<i>Volksstaat.</i> In February 1876, Engels fired an opening salvo with his
<i>Volksstaat</i> article “Prussian Vodka in the German
Reichstag”.</p>
<p class="information">On May 24, 1876, Engels wrote Marx, saying there was
cause to initiate a campaign against the spread of Dühring’s views. Marx
replied the next day, saying Dühring himself should be sharply criticised. So
Engels put aside his work on what would later become known as the book
<i>Dialectics of Nature</i>. On May 28, he outlined to Marx the general
strategy he planned to take against Dühring. It would take over two years to
complete.</p>
<p class="information">The book breaks into three distinct parts:</p>
<p class="information"><span class="term">Part I: Philosophy</span> —
Written mainly between September 1876 and January 1877. Published as a series
of articles entitled <i>Herrn Eugen Dühring's Umwälzung der Philosophie</i>
in <i>Vorwärts</i> between January and May 1877. Later, beginning in 1878,
with the first separate edition, the first two chapters of this part were made
into an independent general introduction to all three parts.</p>
<p class="information"><span class="term">Part II: Political Economy</span>
— Written mainly between June and August 1877. (The last chapter was
actually written by Marx.) Published under the title <i>Herrn Eugen Dühring's
Umwälzung der politischen Oekonomie</i> in <i>Wissenschaftliche Beilage</i>
and in the supplement to <i>Vorwärts</i> between July and December 1877.</p>
<p class="information"><span class="term">Part III: Socialism</span> —
Written mainly between August 1877 and April 1878. Published as <i>Herrn Eugen
Dühring's Umwälzung des Sozialismus</i> in the supplement to <i>Vorwärts</i>
between May and July 1878.</p>
<p class="information">The <i>Vorwärts</i> serials elicited objections from
Dühring's loyal adherents: during the May 27 1877 congress of the Socialist
Workers' Party of Germany, they attempted to ban the on-going publication of it
in the Party paper. Indeed, the sporadic delays in publication were largely due
to their efforts.</p>
<p class="information">In July 1877, Part I was published as a pamphlet. In
July 1878, Parts II and III were combined into a second pamphlet.</p>
<p class="information">In early July 1878, the complete work was first
published as a book — with an added preface by Engels. In October 1878,
Germany’s Anti-Socialist Law was instituted and <i>Anti-Dühring</i> was
banned along with Engels’ other works. In 1886, a second edition appeared
in Zurich. The third, revised and supplemented edition was published in
Stuttgart, in 1894, i.e., after the Anti-Socialist Law was repealed (1890).
This was the last edition during Engels' lifetime. It was translated into
English for the first time in 1907, in Chicago.</p>
<p class="information">In 1880, at Paul Lafargue's request, Engels took three
chapters of <i>Anti-Dühring</i> and created one would become one of the most
popular socialist pamphlets in the world: <i>Socialism: Utopian and
Scientific</i>.</p>

<title>1877: Anti-Duhring - Theory of Value</title>
</head>
<body>
<p class="title">Anti-Dühring by Frederick Engels 1877<br>
Part II: Political Economy</p>
<a id="c5"></a>
<h1>V. Theory of Value</h1>
<p class="fst">It is now about a hundred years since the publication in Leipzig
of a book which by the beginning of the nineteenth century had run through over
thirty editions; it was circulated and distributed in town and country by the
authorities, by preachers and philanthropists of all kinds, and was generally
prescribed as a reader for use in the elementary schools. This book was
Rochow’s <i>Kinderfreund</i>. Its purpose was to teach the youthful
offspring of the peasants and artisans their vocation in life and their duties
to their superiors in society and in the state, and likewise to inspire in them
a beneficent contentment with their lot on earth, with black bread and
potatoes, serf labour, low wages, paternal thrashings and other delectations of
this sort, and all that by means of the system of enlightenment which was then
in vogue. With this aim in view the youth of the towns and of the countryside
was admonished how wisely nature had ordained that man must win his livelihood
and his pleasures by labour, and how happy therefore the peasant or artisan
should feel that it was granted to him to season his meal with bitter labour,
instead of, like the rich glutton, suffering the pangs of indigestion or
constipation, and having to gulp down the choicest tit-bits with repugnance.
These same platitudes that old Rochow thought good enough for the peasant boys
and girls of the electorate of Saxony of his time, are served up to us by Herr
Dühring on page 14 and the following pages of his <i>Cursus</i> as the
"absolutely fundamental" {D. Ph. 150} basis of the most up-to-date political
economy <a id="089"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“Human wants as such have their natural laws, and their
expansion is confined within limits which can be transgressed only by unnatural
acts and only for a time, until these acts result in nausea, weariness of life,
decrepitude, social mutilation and finally salutary annihilation... A game of
life consisting purely of pleasures without any further serious aim soon makes
one <i>blasé</i>, or, what amounts to the same thing exhausts all capacity to
feel. Real labour, in some form or other, is therefore the natural social law
of healthy beings... If instincts and wants were not provided with
counterbalances they could hardly bring us even infantile existence, let alone
a historically intensified development of life. If they could find satisfaction
without limit and without effort they would soon exhaust themselves, leaving an
empty existence in the form of boring intervals lasting until the wants were
felt again... In every respect, therefore, the fact that the satisfaction of
the instincts and passions depends on the surmounting of economic obstacles is
a salutary basic law of both the external arrangement of nature and the inner
constitution of man” {D. C. 14, 15, 16}—and so on, and so forth. <a id="090"></a></p>
<p class="fst">It can be seen that the commonest commonplaces of the worthy
Rochow are celebrating their centenary in Herr Dühring, and do so, moreover, as
the “deeper foundation” {11} of the one and only really critical
and scientific “socialitarian system” {IV}. <a id="091"></a></p>
<p>With the foundations thus laid, Herr Dühring can proceed to build. Applying
the mathematical method, he first gives us, following the ancient Euclid's
example, a series of definitions. This is all the more convenient because it
enables him at once to contrive his definitions in such a way that what is to
be proved with their help is already partially contained in them. And so we
learn at the outset that <a id="092"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">the governing concept in all prior political economy has been
wealth and that wealth, as it really has been understood hitherto and as it has
developed its sway in world history, is “economic power over men and
things” {16-17}. <a id="093"></a></p>
<p class="fst">This is doubly wrong. In the first place the wealth of the
ancient tribal and village communities was in no sense a domination over men.
And secondly, even in societies moving in class antagonisms, wealth, in so far
as it includes domination over men, is mainly and almost exclusively a
domination over men exercised <i>by virtue of</i>, and <i>through the agency
of</i>, the domination over things. From the very early period when the
capture of slaves and the exploitation of slaves became separate branches of
business, the exploiters of slave-labour had to buy the slaves, acquiring
control over men only through their prior control of things, of the purchase
price of the slave and of his means of subsistence and instruments of labour.
Throughout the Middle Ages large landed property was the prerequisite by means
of which the feudal nobility came to have quit-rent peasants and corvée
peasants. And nowadays even a six-year-old child sees that wealth dominates men
exclusively by means of the things which it has at its disposal. <a id="094"></a></p>
<p>But what is it that makes Herr Dühring concoct this false definition of
wealth, and why has he to sever the actual connection which existed in all
former class societies? In order to drag wealth from the domain of economics
over into that of morals. Domination over things is quite all right, but
domination over men is an evil thing; and as Herr Dühring has forbidden himself
to explain domination over men by domination over things, he can once again do
an audacious trick and explain domination over men offhand by his beloved
force. Wealth, as domination over men, is “robbery” {17}—and
with this we are back again at a corrupted version of Proudhon's ancient
formula: “Property is theft.” <a id="095"></a></p>
<p>And so we have now safely brought wealth under two essential aspects,
production and distribution: wealth as domination over things—production
wealth, the good side; wealth as domination over men—distribution wealth
up to the present day, bad side away with it! Applied to the conditions of
today, this means: The capitalist mode of production is quite good and may
remain, but the capitalist mode of distribution is no good and must be
abolished. Such is the nonsense which comes of writing on economics without
even having grasped the connection between production and distribution. <a id="096"></a></p>
<p>After wealth, value is defined as follows: <a id="097"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“Value is the worth which economic things and services
have in commerce.” This worth corresponds to “the price or any
other equivalent name, for example wages” {D. C. 19}. <a id="098"></a></p>
<p class="fst">In other words, value is the price. Or rather, in order not to
do Herr Dühring an injustice and give the absurdity of his definition as far as
possible in his own words: value are the prices. For he says on page 19: <a id="099"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">"value, and the prices expressing it in money" <a id="100"></a></p>
<p class="fst">— thus himself stating that the same value has very
different prices and consequently also just as many different values. If Hegel
had not died long ago, he would hang himself, with all his theologies he could
not have thought up this value which has as many different values as it has
prices. It requires once more someone with the positive assurance of Herr
Dühring to inaugurate a new and deeper foundation for economics with the
declaration that there is no difference between price and value except that one
is expressed in money and the other is not. <a id="101"></a></p>
<p>But all this still does not tell us what value is, and still less by what it
is determined. Herr Dühring has therefore to come across with further
explanations. <a id="102"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“Speaking absolutely in general, the basic law of
comparison and evaluation, on which value and the prices expressing it in money
depend, belongs in the first place to the sphere of pure production, apart from
distribution, which introduces only a second element into the concept of value.
The greater or lesser obstacles which the variety of natural conditions places
in the way of efforts directed toward the procurement of things, and owing to
which it necessitates a greater or lesser expenditure of economic energy,
determine also ... the greater or lesser value”, {19-20} and this is
appraised according to “the resistance offered by nature and
circumstances to the procuring of things {20} ... The extent to which we invest
our own energy into them” (things) “is the immediate determining
cause of the existence of value in general and of a particular magnitude of
it” {21}. : <a id="103"></a></p>
<p class="fst">In so far as there is a meaning in this, it is: The value of a
product of labour is determined by the labour-time necessary for its
production; and we knew that long ago, even without Herr Dühring. Instead of
stating the fact simply, he has to twist it into an oracular saying. It is
simply wrong to say that the dimensions in which anyone invests his energies in
anything (to keep to the bombastic style) is the immediate determining cause of
value and of the magnitude of value. In the first place, it depends on what
thing the energy is put into, and secondly, how the energy is put into it. If
someone makes a thing which has no use-value for other people, his whole energy
does not produce an atom of value; and if he is stiff-necked enough to produce
by hand an object which a machine produces twenty times cheaper,
nineteen-twentieths of the energy he put into it produces neither value in
general nor any particular magnitude of value. <a id="104"></a></p>
<p>Moreover it is an absolute distortion to transform productive labour, which
creates positive products, into a merely negative overcoming of a resistance.
In order to come by a shirt we should then have to set about it somewhat as
follows: Firstly we overcome the resistance of the cotton-seed to being sown
and to growing, then the resistance of the ripe cotton to being picked and
packed and transported, then its resistance to being unpacked and carded and
spun, further the resistance of the yarn to being woven, then the resistance of
the cloth to being bleached and sewn, and finally the resistance of the
completed shirt to being put on. <a id="105"></a></p>
<p>Why all this childish perversion and perversity? In order, by means of the
“resistance”, to pass from the “production value”, the
true but hitherto only ideal value, to the “distribution value”,
the value, falsified by force, which alone was acknowledged in past history: <a id="106"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“In addition to the resistance offered by nature ...
there is yet another, a purely social obstacle... An obstructive power steps in
between man and nature, and this power is once again man. Man, conceived as
alone and isolated, faces nature as a free being... The situation is different
as soon as we think of a second man who, sword in hand, holds the approaches to
nature and its resources and demands a price, whatever form it may take, for
allowing access. This second man..., so to speak, puts a tax on the other and
is thus the reason why the value of the object striven for turns out greater
than it might have been but for this political and social obstacle to the
procuring or production of the object... The particular forms of this
artificially enhanced worth of things are extremely manifold. and it naturally
has its concomitant counterpart in a corresponding forcing down of the worth of
labour {23} ... It is therefore an illusion to attempt to regard value in
advance as an equivalent in the proper sense of this term, that is, as
something which is of equal worth, or as a relation of exchange arising from
the principle that service and counter-service are equal... On the contrary,
the criterion of a correct theory of value will be that the most general cause
of evaluation conceived in the theory does not coincide with the special form
of worth which rests on compulsory distribution. This form varies with the
social system, while economic value proper can only be a production value
measured in relation to nature and in consequence of this will only change with
changes in the obstacles to production of a purely natural and technical
kind” [D. C. 24-25]. <a id="107"></a></p>
<p class="fst">The value which a thing has in practice, according to Herr
Dühring, therefore consists of two parts: first, the labour contained in it,
and, secondly, the tax surcharge imposed “sword in hand”. In other
words, value in practice today is a monopoly price. Now if, in accordance with
this theory of value, all commodities have such a monopoly price, only two
alternatives are possible. Either each individual loses again as a buyer what
he gained as a seller; the prices have changed nominally but in
reality—in their mutual relationship—have remained the same;
everything remains as before, and the far-famed distribution value is a mere
illusion. — Or, on the other hand, the alleged tax surcharges represent a
real sum of values, namely, that produced by the labouring, value-producing
class but appropriated by the monopolist class, and then this sum of values
consists merely of unpaid labour; in this event, in spite of the man with the
sword in his hand, in spite of the alleged tax surcharges and the asserted
distribution value, we arrive once again at the Marxian theory of
<i>surplus-value</i>. <a id="108"></a></p>
<p>But let us look at some examples of the famous “distribution
value”. On page 135 and the following pages we find: <a id="109"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“The shaping of prices as a result of individual
competition must also be regarded as a form of economic distribution and of the
mutual imposition of tribute... If the stock of any necessary commodity is
suddenly reduced to a considerable extent, this gives the sellers a
disproportionate power of exploitation [135-36] ... what a colossal increase in
prices this may produce is shown particularly by those abnormal situations in
which the supply of necessary articles is cut off for any length of time”
[137] and so on. Moreover, even in the normal course of things virtual
monopolies exist which make possible arbitrary price increases, as for example
the railway companies, the companies supplying towns with water and gas [see
153, 154], etc. <a id="110"></a></p>
<p class="fst">It has long been known that such opportunities for monopolistic
exploitation occur. But that the monopoly prices these produce are not to rank
as exceptions and special cases, but precisely as classical examples of the
determination of values in operation today—this is new. How are the
prices of the necessaries of life determined? Herr Dühring replies: Go into a
beleaguered city from which supplies have been cut off, and find out! What
effect has competition on the determination of market prices? Ask the
monopolists — they will tell you all about it! <a id="111"></a></p>
<p>For that matter, even in the case of these monopolies, the man with the
sword in his hand who is supposed to stand behind them is not discoverable. On
the contrary: in cities under siege, if the man with the sword, the commandant,
does his duty, he, as a rule, very soon puts an end to the monopoly and
requisitions the monopolised stocks for the purpose of equal distribution. And
for the rest the men with the sword, when they have tried to fabricate a
"distribution value", have reaped nothing but bad business and financial loss.
With their monopolisation of the East Indian trade, the Dutch brought both
their monopoly and their trade to ruin. The two strongest governments which
ever existed, the North American revolutionary government and the French
National Convention, ventured to fix maximum prices, and they failed miserably.
<a href="footnotes.html#n86" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[86]</sup></a> For some years
now, the Russian government has been trying to raise the exchange rate of
Russian paper money—which it is lowering in Russia by the continuous
emission of irredeemable banknotes—by the equally continuous buying up in
London of bills of exchange on Russia. It has had to pay for this pleasure in
the last few years almost sixty million rubles, and the ruble now stands at
under two marks instead of over three. If the sword has the magic economic
powers ascribed to it by Herr Dühring, why is it that no government has
succeeded in permanently compelling bad money to have the “distribution
value” of good money, or <i>assignats</i> to have the
“distribution value” of gold? And where is the sword which is in
command of the world market? <a id="112"></a></p>
<p>There is also another principal form in which the distribution value
facilitates the appropriation of other people's services without
counter-services: this is possession-rent, that is to say, rent of land and the
profit on capital. For the moment we merely record this, to enable us to. state
that this is all that we learn of this famous “distribution
value”.—All? No, not quite. Listen to this: <a id="113"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“In spite of the twofold standpoint which manifests
itself in the recognition of a production value and a distribution value, there
is nevertheless always underlying these <i>something in common</i>, <i>the
thing of which all values consist</i> and by which they are therefore
measured. The immediate, natural measure is the expenditure of energy, and the
simplest unit is human energy in the crudest sense of the term. This latter can
be reduced to the existence time whose self-maintenance in turn represents the
overcoming of a certain sum of difficulties in nutrition and life.
Distribution, or appropriation, value is present in pure and exclusive form
only where the power to dispose of unproduced things, or, to use a commoner
expression, where these things themselves are exchanged for services or things
of real production value. The homogeneous element, which is indicated and
represented in every expression of value and therefore also in the component
parts of value which are appropriated through distribution without
counter-service consists in the expenditure of human energy, which... finds
embodiment... in each commodity” <a id="114"></a></p>
<p class="fst">Now what should we say to this? If all commodity values are
measured by the expenditure of human energy embodied in the commodities, what
becomes of the distribution value, the price surcharge, the tax? True, Herr
Dühring tells us that even unproduced things—things which consequently
cannot have a real value—can be given a distribution value and exchanged
against things which have been produced and possess value. But at the same time
he tells us that <i>all values</i>—consequently also purely and
exclusively distributive values—consist in the expenditure of energy
embodied in them. Unfortunately we are not told how an expenditure of energy
can find embodiment in an unproduced thing. In any case one point seems to
emerge clearly from all this medley of values: that distribution value the
price surcharge on commodities extorted as a result of social position, and the
tax levied by virtue of the sword all once more amount to nothing. The values
of commodities are determined solely by the expenditure of human energy,
<i>vulgo</i> labour, which finds embodiment in them. So, apart from the rent
of land and the few monopoly prices, Herr Dühring says the same, though in more
slovenly and confused terms, as the much-decried Ricardo-Marxian theory of
value said long ago in clearer and more precise form. <a id="115"></a></p>
<p>He says it, and in the same breath he says the opposite. Marx taking
Ricardo's investigations as his starting-point, says, the value of commodities
is determined by the socially necessary general human labour embodied in them,
and this in turn is measured by its duration. Labour is the measure of all
values, but labour itself has no value. Herr Dühring, after likewise putting
forward, in his clumsy way, labour as the measure of value, continues: <a id="116"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">this “can be reduced to the existence time whose
self-maintenance in turn represents the overcoming of a certain sum of
difficulties in nutrition and life.” {D. C. 27}. <a id="117"></a></p>
<p class="fst">Let us ignore the confusion, due purely to his desire to be
original, of labour-time, which is the only thing that matters here, with
existence time, which has never yet created or measured values. Let us also
ignore the false “socialitarian” presence which the
“self-maintenance” of this existence time is intended to introduce;
so long as the world has existed and so long as it continues to exist every
individual must maintain himself in the sense that he <i>himself</i> consumes
his means of subsistence. Let us assume that Herr Dühring expressed himself in
precise economic terms; then the sentence quoted either means nothing at all or
means the following: The value of a commodity is determined by the labour-time
embodied in it, and the value of this labour-time by the means of subsistence
required for the maintenance of the labourer for this time. And, in its
application to present-day society, this means: the value of a commodity is
determined by the <i>wages</i> contained in it. <a id="118"></a></p>
<p>And this brings us at last to what Herr Dühring is really trying to say. The
value of a commodity is determined, in the phraseology of vulgar economics, by
the production outlays; <a id="119"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">Carey, on the contrary, “brought out the truth that it is not
the costs of production, but the costs of reproduction that determine value”
(<i>Kritische Geschichte</i>, p. 401). <a id="120"></a></p>
<p class="fst">We shall see later what there is to these production or
reproduction costs; at the moment we only note that, as is well known, they
consist of wages and profit on capital. Wages represent the “expenditure of
energy” embodied in commodities, the production value. Profit represents the
tax or price surcharge extorted by the capitalist by virtue of his monopoly,
the sword in his hand—the distribution value. And so the whole
contradictory confusion of the Dühringian theory of value is ultimately
resolved into the most beautiful and harmonious clarity. <a id="121"></a></p>
<p>The determination of the value of commodities by wages, which in Adam Smith
still frequently appeared side by side with its determination by labour-time,
has been banned from scientific political economy since Ricardo, and nowadays
survives only in vulgar economics. It is precisely the shallowest sycophants of
the existing capitalist order of society who preach the determination of value
by wages, and along with this, describe the profit of the capitalist likewise
as a higher sort of wages, as the wages of abstinence (reward to the capitalist
for not playing ducks and drakes with his capital), as the premium on risk, as
the wages of management, etc. Herr Dühring differs from them only in declaring
that profit is robbery. In other words, Herr Dühring bases his socialism
directly on the doctrines of the worst kind of vulgar economics. And his
socialism is worth just as much as this vulgar economics. They stand and fall
together. <a id="122"></a></p>
<p>After all, it is clear that what a labourer produces and what he costs are
just as much different things as what a machine produces and what it costs. The
value created by a labourer in a twelve-hour working-day has nothing in common
with the value of the means of subsistence which he consumes in this
working-day and the period of rest that goes with it. In these means of
subsistence there may be embodied three, four or seven hours of labour-time
varying with the stage of development reached in the productivity of labour. If
we assume that seven hours of labour were necessary for their production, then
the theory of value of vulgar economics which Herr Dühring has accepted implies
that the product of twelve hours of labour has the value of the product of
seven hours of labour, that twelve hours of labour are equal to seven hours of
labour, or that 12=7. To put it even more plainly: A labourer working on the
land, no matter under what social relationships produces in a year a certain
quantity of grain, say sixty bushels of wheat. During this time he consumes a
sum of values amounting of forty-five bushels of wheat. Then the sixty bushels
of wheat have the same value as the forty-five bushels, and that in the same
market and with other conditions remaining absolutely identical; in other
words, sixty=forty-five. And this styles itself political economy! <a id="123"></a></p>
<p>The whole development of human society beyond the stage of brute savagery
begins on the day when the labour of the family created more products than were
necessary for its maintenance on the day when a portion of labour could be
devoted to the production no longer of the mere means of subsistence, but of
means of production. A surplus of the product of labour over and above the
costs of maintenance of the labour, and the formation and enlargement, out of
this surplus, of a social production and reserve fund, was and is the basis of
all social, political and intellectual progress. In history, up to the present,
this fund has been the possession of a privileged class, on which also devolved
along with this possession, political domination and intellectual leadership.
The impending social revolution will for the first time make this social
production and reserve fund—that is, the total mass of raw materials,
instruments of production and means of subsistence — a really social
fund, by depriving that privileged class of the disposal of it and transferring
it to the whole of society as its common property. <a id="124"></a></p>
<p>Of two alternative courses, one. Either the value of commodities is
determined by the costs of maintenance of the labour necessary for their
production—that is, in present-day society, by the wages. In that case
each labourer receives in <i>his wages the value of the product of his
labour;</i> and then the exploitation of the wage-earning class by the
capitalist class is an impossibility. Let us assume that the costs of
maintenance of a labourer in a given society can be expressed by the sum of
three marks. Then the product of a day's labour, according to the above-cited
theory of the vulgar economists, has the value of three marks. Let us assume
that the capitalist who employs this labourer, adds a profit to this product, a
tribute of one mark, and sells it for four marks. The other capitalists do the
same. But from that moment the labourer can no longer cover his daily needs
with three marks, but also requires four marks for this purpose. As all other
conditions are assumed to have remained unchanged, the wages expressed in means
of subsistence must remain the same, while the wages expressed in money must
rise, namely, from three marks to four marks a day. What the capitalists take
from the working class in the form of profit, they must give back to it in the
form of wages. We are just where we were at the beginning: if wages determine
value, no exploitation of the worker by the capitalist is possible. But the
formation of a surplus of products is also impossible, for, on the basis of the
assumption from which we started, the labourers consume just as much value as
they produce. And as the capitalists produce no value, it is impossible to see
how they expect to live. And if such a surplus of production over consumption,
such a production and reserve fund, nevertheless exists, and exists in the
hands of the capitalists, no other possible explanation remains but that the
workers consume for their self-maintenance merely the <i>value</i> of the
commodities and have handed over the commodities themselves to the capitalist
for further use. <a id="125"></a></p>
<p>Or, on the other hand, if this production and reserve fund does in fact
exist in the hands of the capitalist class, if it has actually arisen through
the accumulation of profit (for the moment we leave the land rent out of
account), then it necessarily consists of the accumulated surplus of the
product of labour handed over to the capitalist class by the working class,
over and above the sum of wages paid to the working class by the capitalist
class. In this case, however, it is not wages that determine value, but the
quantity of labour; in this case the working class hands over to the capitalist
class in the product of labour a greater quantity of value than it receives
from it in the shape of wages; and then the profit on capital, like all other
forms of appropriation without payment of the labour product of others, is
explained as a simple component part of this surplus-value discovered by Marx.
<a id="126"></a></p>
<p>Incidentally, in Dühring's whole <i>Cursus</i> of political economy there
is no mention of that great and epoch-making discovery with which Ricardo opens
his most important work: <a id="127"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“The value of a commodity ... depends on the quantity of
labour which is necessary for its production, and not on the greater or lesser
compensation which is paid for that labour.“ <a id="128"></a></p>
<p class="fst">In the <i>Kritische Geschichte</i> it is dismissed with the
oracular phrase: <a id="129"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“It is not considered” (by Ricardo) “that the greater or
lesser proportion in which wages can be an allotment of the necessaries of
life” (!) “must also involve ... different forms of the value relationships!”
{D. K. G. 215.} <a id="130"></a></p>
<p class="fst">A phrase into which the reader can read what he pleases, and is
on safest ground if he reads into it nothing at all. <a id="131"></a></p>
<p>And now let the reader select for himself, from the five sorts of value
served up to us by Herr Dühring, the one that he likes best: the production
value, which comes from nature; or the distribution value, which man’s
wickedness has created and which is distinguished by the fact that it is
measured by the expenditure of energy, which is not contained in it; or
thirdly, the value which is measured by labour-time; or fourthly, the value
which is measured by the costs of reproduction; or lastly, the value which is
measured by wages. The selection is wide, the confusion complete, and the only
thing left for us to do is to exclaim with Herr Dühring: <a id="132"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“The theory of value is the touchstone of the worth of
economic systems!” {499} <a id="133"></a></p>

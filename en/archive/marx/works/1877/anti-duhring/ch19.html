<h1>VII. Capital and Surplus Value</h1>
<p class="fst">“To begin with, Herr Marx does not hold the accepted
economic view of capital, namely, that it is a means of production already
produced; on the contrary, he tries to get up a more special,
dialectical-historical idea that toys with metamorphoses of concepts and
history. According to him, capital is born of money, it forms a historical
phase opening with the sixteenth century, that is, with the first beginnings of
a world market, which presumably appeared at that period. It is obvious that
the keenness of national-economic analysis is lost in such a conceptual
interpretation. In such barren conceptions, which are represented as half
historical and half logical, but which in fact are only bastards of historical
and logical fantasy, the faculty of discernment perishes, together with all
honesty in the use of concepts” {D. K. G. 497-98} —</p>
<p class="fst">and so he blusters along for a whole page... <a id="147"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“Marx's definition of the concept of capital can only
cause confusion in the strict theory of national economy ... frivolities which
are palmed off as profound logical truths ... the fragility of
foundations” {D. K. G. 498} and so forth. <a id="148"></a></p>
<p class="fst">So according to Marx, we are told, capital was born of money at
the beginning of the sixteenth century. This is like saying that fully three
thousand years ago metallic money was born of cattle, because once upon a time
cattle, among other things, functioned as money. Only Herr Dühring is capable
of such a crude and inept manner of expressing himself. In the analysis which
Marx makes of the economic forms within which the process of the circulation of
commodities takes place, money appears as the final form. “This final
product of the circulation of commodities is the <i>first form in which</i>
capital <i>appears.</i> As a matter of history, capital, as opposed to landed
property, invariably takes the form at first of money; it appears as moneyed
wealth, as the capital of the merchant and of the usurer... We can see it daily
under our very eyes. All new capital, to commence with, comes on the stage,
that is, on the market, whether of commodities, labour, or money, even in our
days, in the shape of money that by a definite process has to be transformed
into capital.” Here once again Marx is stating a fact. Unable to dispute
it, Herr Dühring distorts it: Capital, he has Marx say, is born of money! <a id="149"></a></p>
<p>Marx then investigates the processes by which money is transformed into
capital, and finds, first, that the form in which money circulates as capital
is the inversion of the form in which it circulates as the general equivalent
of commodities. The simple owner of commodities sells in order to buy; he sells
what he does not need, and with the money thus procured he buys what he does
need. The incipient capitalist starts by buying what he does <i>not</i> need
himself; he buys in order to sell, and to sell at a higher price, in order to
get back the value of the money originally thrown into the transaction,
augmented by an increment in money; and Marx calls this increment
<i>surplus-value.</i> <a id="150"></a></p>
<p>Whence comes this surplus-value? It cannot come either from the buyer buying
the commodities under their value, or from the seller selling them above their
value. For in both cases the gains and the losses of each individual cancel
each other, as each individual is in turn buyer and seller. Nor can it come
from cheating, for though cheating can enrich one person at the expense of
another, it cannot increase the total sum possessed by both, and therefore
cannot augment the sum of the values in circulation. “The capitalist
class, as a whole, in any country, cannot over-reach themselves.” <a id="151"></a></p>
<p>And yet we find that in each country the capitalist class as a whole is
continuously enriching itself before our eyes, by selling dearer than it had
bought, by appropriating to itself surplus-value. We are therefore just where
we were at the start: whence comes this surplus-value? This problem must be
solved, and it must be solved in a <i>purely economic</i> way, excluding all
cheating and the intervention of any force—the problem being: how is it
possible constantly to sell dearer than one has bought, even on the hypothesis
that equal values are always exchanged for equal values? <a id="152"></a></p>
<p>The solution of this problem was the most epoch-making achievement of
Marx’s work. It spread the clear light of day through economic domains in
which socialists no less than bourgeois economists previously groped in utter
darkness. Scientific socialism dates from the discovery of this solution and
has been built up around it. <a id="153"></a></p>
<p>This solution is as follows: The increase in the value of money that is to
be converted into capital cannot take place in the <i>money</i> itself, nor
can it originate in the <i>purchase</i>, as here this money does no more than
realise the price of the commodity, and this price, inasmuch as we took as our
premise an exchange of equivalents, is not different from its value. For the
same reason, the increase in value cannot originate in the <i>sale</i> of the
commodity. The change must, therefore, take place in the <i>commodity</i>
bought; not however in its <i>value</i>, as it is bought and sold at its
value, but in its <i>use-value</i> as such, that is, the change of value must
originate in the consumption of the commodity. “In order to be able to
extract value from the consumption of a commodity, our friend, Moneybags, must
be so lucky as to find ... in the market, a commodity, whose use-value
possesses the peculiar property of being a source of value, whose actual
consumption, therefore, is itself an embodiment of labour, and, consequently, a
<i>creation of value.</i> The possessor of money does find on the market such
a special commodity in capacity for labour or <i>labour-power</i>.”
Though, as we saw, labour as such can have no value, this is by no means the
case with labour-power. This acquires a value from the moment that it becomes a
<i>commodity</i>, as it is in fact at the present time, and this value is
determined, “as in the case of every other commodity, by the labour-time
necessary for the production, and consequently also the reproduction, of this
special article“; that is to say, by the labour-time necessary for the
production of the means of subsistence which the labourer requires for his
maintenance in a fit state to work and for the perpetuation of his race. Let us
assume that these means of subsistence represent six hours of labour-time
daily. Our incipient capitalist, who buys labour-power for carrying on his
business, i.e., hires a labourer, consequently pays this labourer the full
value of his day's labour-power if he pays him a sum of money which also
represents six hours of labour. And as soon as the labourer has worked six
hours in the employment of the incipient capitalist, he has fully reimbursed
the latter for his outlay, for the value of the day's labour-power which he had
paid. But so far the money would not have been converted into capital, it would
not have produced any surplus-value. And for this reason the buyer of
labour-power has quite a different notion of the nature of the transaction he
has carried out. The fact that only six hours’ labour is necessary to
keep the labourer alive for twenty-four hours, does not in any way prevent him
from working twelve hours out of the twenty-four. The value of the
labour-power, and the value which that labour-power creates in the
labour-process, are two different magnitudes. The owner of the money has paid
the value of a day’s labour-power; his, therefore, is the use of it for a
day — a whole day’s labour. The circumstance that the value which
the use of it during one day <i>creates</i> is double its own value for a day
is a piece of especially good luck for the buyer, but according to the laws of
exchange of commodities by no means an injustice to the seller. On our
assumption, therefore, the labourer each day <i>costs</i> the owner of money
the value of the product of six hours’ labour, but he <i>hands over</i>
to him each day the value of the product of twelve hours' labour. The
difference in favour of the owner of the money is six hours of unpaid
surplus-labour, a surplus-product for which he does not pay and in which six
hours’ labour is embodied. The trick has been performed. Surplus-value
has been produced; money has been converted into capital. <a id="154"></a></p>
<p>In thus showing how surplus-value arises, and how alone surplus-value can
arise under the domination of the laws regulating the exchange of commodities,
Marx exposed the mechanism of the existing capitalist mode of production and of
the mode of appropriation based on it; he revealed the core around which the
whole existing social order has crystallised. <a id="155"></a></p>
<p>However, this creation of capital requires that one essential prerequisite
be fulfilled: “For the conversion of his money into capital the owner of
money must meet in the market with the <i>free labourer</i>, free in the
double sense, that as a free man he can dispose of his labour-power as his own
commodity, and that on the other hand he has no other commodity for sale, is
short of everything necessary for the realisation of his labour-power.”
But this relation between the owners of money or of commodities on the one
hand, and those who possess nothing beyond their own labour-power on the other,
is not a natural relation, nor is it one that is common to all historical
periods: “It is clearly the result of a past historical development, the
product ... of the extinction of a whole series of older forms of social
production.” And in fact we first encounter this free labourer on a mass
scale in history at the end of the fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth
century, as a result of the dissolution of the feudal mode of production. With
this, however, and with the bringing into being of world trade and the world
market dating from the same epoch, the basis was established on which the mass
of the existing movable wealth was necessarily more and more converted into
capital, and the capitalist mode of production, aimed at the creation of
surplus-value, necessarily became more and more exclusively the prevailing
mode. <a id="156"></a></p>
<p>Up to this point, we have been following the “barren
conceptions” of Marx, these “bastards of historical and logical
fantasy” in which “the faculty of discernment perishes, together
with all honesty in the use of concepts”. Let us contrast these
“frivolities” with the “profound logical truths” and
the “definitive and most strictly scientific treatment in the sense of
the exact disciplines” {D. K. G. 498}, such as Herr Dühring offers us. <a id="157"></a></p>
<p>So Marx “does not hold the accepted economic view of capital, namely,
that it is a means of production already produced” {497}; he says, on the
contrary, that a sum of values is converted into capital only when it
<i>increases its value</i>, when it forms surplus-value. And what does Herr
Dühring say? <a id="158"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“Capital is a basis of means of economic power for the
continuation of production <i>and for the formation of shares in the fruits of
the general labour-power</i>” {D C. 40}, <a id="159"></a></p>
<p class="fst">However oracularly and slovenly that too is expressed, this much
at least is certain: the basis of means of economic power may continue
production to eternity, but according to Herr Dühring’s own words it will
not become capital so long as it does not form “shares in the fruits of
the general labour-power”—that is to say, form surplus-value or at
least surplus-product. Herr Dühring therefore not only himself commits the sin
with which he charges Marx—of not holding the accepted economic view of
capital—but besides commits a clumsy plagiarism of Marx, “badly
concealed” {D. K. G. 506} by high-sounding phrases. <a id="160"></a></p>
<p>On page 262 {D. C.} this is further developed: <a id="161"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“Capital in the social sense” (and Herr Dühring
still has to discover a capital in a sense which is not social) “is in
fact specifically different from the mere means of production; for while the
latter have only a technical character and are necessary under all conditions,
the former is distinguished by its social power of appropriation and the
formation of shares. It is true that social capital is to a great extent
nothing but the technical means of production <i>in their social
function;</i> but it is precisely this function which ... must
disappear”. <a id="162"></a></p>
<p class="fst">When we reflect that it was precisely Marx who first drew
attention to the “social function” by virtue of which alone a sum
of values becomes capital, it will certainly "at once be clear to every
attentive investigator of the subject that Marx’s definition of the
concept of capital can only cause confusion” {D. K. G. 498}—not,
however, as Herr Dühring thinks, in the strict theory of national economy but
as is evident simply and solely in the head of Herr Dühring himself, who in the
<i>Kritische Geschichte</i> has already forgotten how much use he made of the
said concept of capital in his <i>Cursus</i>. However, Herr Dühring is not
content with borrowing from Marx the latter’s definition of capital,
though in a “purified” form. He is obliged to follow Marx also in
the “toying with metamorphoses of concepts and history” {497}, in
spite of his own better knowledge that nothing could come of it but
“barren conceptions”, “frivolities”, “fragility
of the foundations” {498} and so forth. Whence comes this “social
function” {D. C. 262} of capital, which enables it to appropriate the
fruits of others’ labour and which alone distinguishes it from mere means
of production? <a id="163"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">Herr Dühring says that it does not depend “on the
nature of the means of production and their technical indispensability”
{262}. <a id="164"></a></p>
<p class="fst">It therefore arose historically, and on page 262 Herr Dühring
only tells us again what we have heard ten times before, when he explains its
origin by means of the old familiar adventures of the two men, one of whom at
the dawn of history converted his means of production into capital by the use
of force against the other. But not content with ascribing a historical
beginning to the social function through which alone a sum of values becomes
capital Herr Dühring prophesies that it will also have a historical end. It is
“precisely this which must disappear” {262}. In ordinary parlance
it is customary to call a phenomenon which arose historically and disappears
again historically, “a historical phase”. Capital, therefore, is a
historical phase not only according to Marx but also according to Herr Dühring,
and we are consequently forced to the conclusion that we are among Jesuits
here. When two persons do the same thing, then it is not the same. <span class="context">[A paraphrase of a dictum from the comedy <i>Adelphoe by</i>
the Roman playwright Terentius (Act V, Scene 3).—<i>Ed</i>.]</span>
When Marx says that capital is a historical phase, that is a barren conception,
a bastard of historical and logical fantasy, in which the faculty of
discernment perishes, together with all honesty in the use of concepts When
Herr Dühring likewise presents capital as a historical phase that is proof of
the keenness of his economic analysis and of his definitive and most strictly
scientific treatment in the sense of the exact disciplines. <a id="165"></a></p>
<p>What is it then that distinguishes the Dühringian conception of capital from
the Marxian? <a id="166"></a></p>
<p>“Capital,” says Marx, “has not invented surplus-labour.
Wherever a part of society possesses the monopoly of the means of production,
the labourer, free or not free, must add to the working-time necessary for his
own maintenance an extra working-time in order to produce the means of
subsistence for the owners of the means of production.” Surplus-labour,
labour beyond the time required for the labourer's own maintenance, and
appropriation by others of the product of this surplus-labour, the exploitation
of labour, is therefore common to all forms of society that have existed
hitherto, in so far as these have moved in class antagonisms. But it is only
when the product of this surplus-labour assumes the form of surplus-value, when
the owner of the means of production finds the free labourer—free from
social fetters and free from possessions of his own—as an object of
exploitation, and exploits him for the purpose of the production of
<i>commodities</i>—it is only then, according to Marx, that the means
of production assume the specific character of capital. And this first took
place on a large scale at the end of the fifteenth and the beginning of the
sixteenth century. <a id="167"></a></p>
<p>Herr Dühring on the contrary declares that <i>every</i> sum of means of
production which “forms shares in the fruits of the general
labour-power” {D. C. 40}, that is, yields surplus-labour in any form, is
capital. In other words, Herr Dühring annexes the surplus-labour discovered by
Marx, in order to use it to kill the surplus-value, likewise discovered by
Marx, which for the moment 3 does not suit his purpose. According to Herr
Dühring, therefore, not only the movable and immovable wealth of the Corinthian
and Athenian citizens, built on a slave economy, but also the wealth of the
large Roman landowners of the time of the empire, and equally the wealth of the
feudal barons of the Middle Ages, in so far as it in any way served
production—all this without distinction is capital. <a id="168"></a></p>
<p>So that Herr Dühring himself does not hold “the accepted view of
capital, namely, that it is a means of production already produced” {D.
K. G. 497}, but rather one that is the very opposite of it, a view which
includes in capital even means of production which have not been produced, the
earth and its natural resources. The idea, however, that capital is simply
“produced means of production” is once again the accepted view only
in vulgar political economy. Outside of this vulgar economics, which Herr
Dühring holds so dear, the “produced means of production” or any
sum of values whatever, becomes capital only by yielding profit or interest,
i.e., by appropriating the surplus-product of unpaid labour in the form of
surplus-value, and, moreover, by appropriating it in these two definite
subforms of surplus-value. It is of absolutely no importance that the whole of
bourgeois economy is still labouring under the idea that the property of
yielding profit or interest is inherent in every sum of values which is
utilised under normal conditions in production or exchange. In classical
political economy, capital and profit, or capital and interest, are just as
inseparable, stand in the same reciprocal relations to each other, as cause and
effect, father and son, yesterday and today. The word “capital” in
its modern economic meaning is first met with, however, at the time when the
thing itself makes its appearance, when movable wealth acquires, to a greater
and greater extent, the function of capital, by exploiting the surplus-labour
of free labourers for the production of commodities; and in fact it was
introduced by the first nation of capitalists in history, the Italians of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. And if Marx was the first to make a
fundamental analysis of the mode of appropriation characteristic of modern
capital; if he brought the concept of capital into harmony with the historical
facts from which, in the last analysis, it had been abstracted, and to which it
owed its existence; if by so doing Marx cleared this economic concept of those
obscure and vacillating ideas which still clung to it even in classical
bourgeois political economy and among the former socialists — then it was
Marx who applied that “definitive and most strictly scientific
treatment“ {498} about which Herr Dühring is so constantly talking and
which we so painfully miss in his works. <a id="169"></a></p>
<p>In actual fact, Herr Dühring’s treatment is quite different from this.
He is not content with first inveighing against the presentation of capital as
a historical phase by calling it a “bastard of historical and logical fantasy”
{498} and then himself presenting it as a historical phase. He also roundly
declares that <i>all</i> means of economic power, <i>all</i> means of
production which appropriate “shares in the fruits of the general labour-power”
{D. C. 40}—and therefore also landed property in all class
societies—are capital; which however does not in the least prevent him,
in the further course of his exposition, from separating landed property and
land rent, quite in the traditional manner, from capital and profit, and
designating as capital only those means of production which yield profit or
interest, as he does at considerable length on page 156 and the following pages
of his <i>Cursus</i>. With equal justice Herr Dühring might first include
under the name 'locomotive" also horses, oxen, asses and dogs, on the ground
that these, too, can be used as means of transport, and reproach modern
engineers with limiting the name locomotive to the modern steam-engine and
thereby setting it up as a historical phase, using barren conceptions, bastards
of historical and logical fantasy and so forth; and then finally declare that
horses, asses, oxen and dogs are nevertheless excluded from the term
locomotive, and that this term is applicable only to the
steam-engine.—And so once more we are compelled to say that it is
precisely the Dühringian conception of capital in which all keenness of
economic analysis is lost and the faculty of discernment perishes, together
with all honesty in the use of concepts; and that the barren conceptions, the
confusion, the frivolities palmed off as profound logical truths and the
fragility of the foundations are to be found in full bloom precisely in Herr
Dühring’s work. <a id="170"></a></p>
<p>But all that is of no consequence. For Herr Dühring’s is the glory
nevertheless of having discovered the axis on which all economics, all politics
and jurisprudence, in a word, all history, has hitherto revolved. Here it is:
<a id="171"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“Force and labour are the two principal factors which come
into play in forming social connections” {D. C. 255}. <a id="172"></a></p>
<p class="fst">In this one sentence we have the complete constitution of the
economic world up to the present day. It is extremely short, and runs: <a id="173"></a></p>
<p>Article One: Labour produces. <a id="174"></a></p>
<p>Article Two: Force distributes. <a id="175"></a></p>
<p>And this, “speaking in plain human language” {D. K. G. 496}, sums up the
whole of Herr Dühring's economic wisdom. <a id="176"></a></p>

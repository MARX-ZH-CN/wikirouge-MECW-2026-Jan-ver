<h1>VII. Philosophy of Nature.<br>
The Organic World</h1>
<a id="221"></a>
<p class="quoted">“A single and uniform ladder of intermediate steps
leads from the mechanics of pressure and impact to the linking together of
sensations and ideas” {D. Ph. 104}.</p>
<a id="222"></a>
<p class="fst">With this assurance Herr Dühring saves himself the trouble of
saying anything further about the origin of life, although it might reasonably
have been expected that a thinker who had traced the evolution of the world
back to its self-equal state, and is so much at home on other celestial bodies,
would have known exactly what’s what also on this point. For the rest,
however, the assurance he gives us is only half right unless it is completed by
the Hegelian nodal line of measure relations which has already been mentioned.
In spite of all gradualness, the transition from one form of motion to another
always remains a leap, a decisive change. This is true of the transition from
the mechanics of celestial bodies to that of smaller masses on a particular
celestial body; it is equally true of the transition from the mechanics of
masses to the mechanics of molecules — including the forms of motion
investigated in physics proper: heat, light, electricity, magnetism. In the
same way, the transition from the physics of molecules to the physics of atoms
— chemistry — in turn involves a decided leap; and this is even
more clearly the case in the transition from ordinary chemical action to the
chemism of albumen which we call life. <a href="footnotes.html#n39" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[39]</sup></a> Then within the sphere of life the leaps become
ever more infrequent and imperceptible. — Once again, therefore, it is
Hegel who has to correct Herr Dühring.</p>
<a id="223"></a>
<p>The concept of purpose provides Herr Dühring with a conceptual transition to
the organic world. Once again, this is borrowed from Hegel, who in his
<i>Logic</i> — the Doctrine of the Notion — makes the transition
from chemism to life by means of teleology, or the science of purpose. Wherever
we look in Herr Dühring we run into a Hegelian “crudity”, which he
quite unblushingly dishes out to us as his own deep-rooted science. It would
take us too far afield to investigate here the extent to which it is legitimate
and appropriate to apply the ideas of means and end to the organic world. In
any case, even the application of the Hegelian “inner purpose”
— i.e., a purpose which is not imported into nature by some third party
acting purposively, such as the wisdom of providence, but lies in the necessity
of the thing itself — constantly leads people who are not well versed in
philosophy to thoughtlessly ascribing to nature conscious and purposive
activity. That same Herr Dühring who is filled with boundless moral indignation
at the slightest "spiritistic" tendency in other people assures us</p>
<a id="224"></a>
<p class="quoted">“with certainty that the instinctive sensations were
primarily created for the sake of the satisfaction involved in their
activity” {D. Ph. 158}.</p>
<a id="225"></a>
<p class="fst">He tells us that poor nature</p>
<a id="226"></a>
<p class="quoted">“is obliged incessantly to maintain order in the world
of objects” {159} and in doing so she has to settle more than one
business “which requires more subtlety on the part of nature than is
usually credited to her” {165}. But nature not only <i>knows</i> why
she does one thing or another; she has not only to perform the duties of a
housemaid, she not only possesses subtlety, in itself a pretty good
accomplishment in subjective conscious thought; she has also a will. For what
the instincts do in addition, incidentally fulfilling real natural functions
such as nutrition propagation, etc., “we should not regard as directly
but only indirectly <i>willed</i>” {169}.</p>
<a id="227"></a>
<p class="fst">So we have arrived at a consciously thinking and acting nature,
and are thus already standing on the “bridge” — not indeed
from the static to the dynamic, but from pantheism to deism. Or is Herr Dühring
perhaps just for once indulging a little in “natural-philosophical
semi-poetry”?</p>
<a id="228"></a>
<p>Impossible! All that our philosopher of reality can tell us of organic
nature is restricted to the fight against this natural-philosophical
semi-poetry, against <span class="duhring">“charlatanism with its
frivolous superficialities and pseudo-scientific mystifications”</span>,
against the <span class="duhring">“poetising features”</span> {109}
of <i>Darwinism</i>.</p>
<a id="229"></a>
<p>The main reproach levelled against Darwin is that he transferred the
Malthusian population theory from political economy to natural science, that he
was held captive by the ideas of an animal breeder, that in his theory of the
struggle for existence he pursued unscientific semi-poetry, and that the whole
of Darwinism, after deducting what had been borrowed from Lamarck, is a piece
of brutality directed against humanity.</p>
<a id="230"></a>
<p>Darwin brought back from his scientific travels the view that plant and
animal species are not constant but subject to variation. In order to follow up
this idea after his return home there was no better field available than that
of the breeding of animals and plants. It is precisely in this field that
England is the classical country; the achievements of other countries, for
example Germany, fall far short of what England has achieved in this
connection. Moreover, most of these successes have been won during the last
hundred years, so that there is very little difficulty in establishing the
facts. Darwin found that this breeding produced artificially, among animals and
plants of the same species, differences greater than those found in what are
generally recognised as different species. Thus was established on the one hand
the variability of species up to a certain point, and on the other the
possibility of a common ancestry for organisms with different specific
characteristics. Darwin then investigated whether there were not possibly
causes in nature which — without the conscious intention of the breeder
— would nevertheless in the long run produce in living organisms changes
similar to those produced by artificial selection. He discovered these causes
in the disproportion between the immense number of germs <span class="context">[in the original <i>Keime</i>,
‘shoots’,‘embryos’] </span>created by nature and the
insignificant number of organisms which actually attain maturity. But as each
germ strives to develop, there necessarily arises a struggle for existence
which manifests itself not merely as direct bodily combat or devouring, but
also as a struggle for space and light, even in the case of plants. And it is
evident that in this struggle those individuals which have some individual
peculiarity, however insignificant, that gives them an advantage in the
struggle for existence will have the best prospect of reaching maturity and
propagating themselves. These individual peculiarities have thus the tendency
to descend by heredity, and when they occur among many individuals of the same
species, to become more pronounced through accumulated heredity in the
direction once taken; while those individuals which do not possess these
peculiarities succumb more easily in the struggle for existence and gradually
disappear. In this way a species is altered through natural selection, through
the survival of the fittest.</p>
<a id="231"></a>
<p>Against this Darwinian theory Herr Dühring now says that the origin of the
idea of the struggle for existence, as, he claims, Darwin himself admitted, has
to be sought in a generalisation of the views of the economist and theoretician
of population, Malthus, and that the idea therefore suffers from all the
defects inherent in the priestly Malthusian ideas of over-population {D. Ph.
101}. — Now Darwin would not dream of saying that the <i>origin</i> of
the idea of the struggle for existence is to be found in Malthus. He only says
that his theory of the struggle for existence is the theory of Malthus applied
to the animal and plant world as a whole. However great the blunder made by
Darwin in accepting the Malthusian theory so naively and uncritically,
nevertheless anyone can see at the first glance that no Malthusian spectacles
are required to perceive the struggle for existence in nature — the
contradiction between the countless host of germs which nature so lavishly
produces and the small number of those which ever reach maturity, a
contradiction which in fact for the most part finds its solution in a struggle
for existence — often of extreme cruelty. And just as the law of wages
has maintained its validity even after the Malthusian arguments on which
Ricardo based it have long been consigned to oblivion, so likewise the struggle
for existence can take place in nature, even without any Malthusian
interpretation. For that matter, the organisms of nature also have their laws
of population, which have been left practically uninvestigated, although their
establishment would be of decisive importance for the theory of the evolution
of species. But who was it that lent decisive impetus to work in this direction
too? No other than Darwin.</p>
<a id="232"></a>
<p>Herr Dühring carefully avoids an examination of this positive side of the
question. Instead, the struggle for existence is arraigned again and again. It
is obvious, according to him, that there can be no talk of a struggle for
existence among unconscious plants and good-natured plant-eaters:</p>
<a id="233"></a>
<p class="quoted">“in the precise and definite sense the struggle for
existence is found in the realm of brutality to the extent that animals live on
prey and its devourment” {118}.</p>
<a id="234"></a>
<p class="fst">And after he has reduced the idea of the struggle for existence
to these narrow limits he can give full vent to his indignation at the
brutality of this idea, which he himself has restricted to brutality. But this
moral indignation only rebounds upon Herr Dühring himself, who is indeed the
only author of the struggle for existence in this limited conception and is
therefore solely responsible for it. It is consequently not Darwin who</p>
<a id="235"></a>
<p class="quoted">“sought the laws and understanding of all nature's
actions in the kingdom of the brutes” {117}, — </p>
<a id="236"></a>
<p class="fst">Darwin had in fact expressly included the whole of organic
nature in the struggle — but an imaginary bugbear dressed up by Herr
Dühring himself. The <i>name:</i> the struggle for existence, can for that
matter be willingly sacrificed to Herr Dühring's highly moral indignation. That
the <i>fact</i> exists also among plants can be demonstrated to him by every
meadow, every cornfield, every wood; and the question at issue is not what it
is to be called, whether <span class="duhring">“struggle for existence”</span>
or <span class="duhring">“lack of conditions of life and mechanical
effects”</span> {118}, but how this fact influences the preservation or
variation of species. On this point Herr Dühring maintains an obstinate and
self-equal silence. Therefore for the time being everything may remain as it
was in natural selection.</p>
<a id="237"></a>
<p class="quoted">But Darwinism “produces its transformations and differences
out of nothing” {114}.</p>
<a id="238"></a>
<p class="fst">It is true that Darwin, when considering natural selection,
leaves out of account the <i>causes</i> which have produced the alterations
in separate individuals, and deals in the first place with the way in which
such individual deviations gradually become the characteristics of a race,
variety or species. To Darwin it was of less immediate importance to discover
these causes — which up to the present are in part absolutely unknown,
and in part can only be stated in quite general terms — than to find a
rational form in which their effects become fixed, acquire permanent
significance. It is true that in doing this Darwin attributed to his discovery
too wide a field of action, made it the sole agent in the alteration of species
and neglected the causes of the repeated individual variations, concentrating
rather on the form in which these variations become general; but this is a
mistake which he shares with most other people who make any real advance.
Moreover, if Darwin produces his individual transformations out of nothing, and
in so doing applies exclusively <span class="duhring">“the wisdom of the
breeder”</span> {125}, the breeder, too, must produce <i>out of nothing</i>
his transformations in animal and plant forms which are not merely imaginary
but real. But once again, the man who gave the impetus to investigate how
exactly these transformations and differences arise is no other than Darwin.</p>
<a id="239"></a>
<p>In recent times the idea of natural selection was extended, particularly by
Haeckel, and the variation of species conceived as a result of the mutual
interaction of adaptation and heredity, in which process adaptation is taken as
the factor which produces variations, and heredity as the preserving factor.
This is also not regarded as satisfactory by Herr Dühring.</p>
<a id="240"></a>
<p class="quoted">“Real adaptation to conditions of life which are offered or
withheld by nature presupposes impulses and actions determined by ideas.
Otherwise the adaptation is only apparent, and the causality operative
thereupon does not rise above the low grades of the physical, chemical and
plant-physiological” {D. Ph. 115}.</p>
<a id="241"></a>
<p class="fst">Once again it is the name which makes Herr Dühring angry. But
whatever name he may give to the process, the question here is whether
variations in the species of organisms are produced through such processes or
not. And again Herr Dühring gives no answer.</p>
<a id="242"></a>
<p class="quoted">“If, in growing, a plant takes the path along which it will
receive most light, this effect of the stimulus is nothing but a combination of
physical forces and chemical agents, and any attempt to describe it as
adaptation — not metaphorically, but in the strict sense of the word
— must introduce a <i>spiritistic</i> confusion into the concepts”
{115}.</p>
<a id="243"></a>
<p class="fst">Such is the severity meted out to others by the very man who
knows exactly by whose <i>will</i> nature does one thing or another, who
speaks of nature's <i>subtlety</i> and even of her <i>will!</i> Spiritistic
confusion, yes — but where, in Haeckel or in Herr Dühring?</p>
<a id="244"></a>
<p>And not only spiritistic, but also logical confusion. We saw that Herr
Dühring insists with might and main on establishing the validity in nature of
the concept of purpose:</p>
<a id="245"></a>
<p class="quoted">“The relation between means and end does not in the least
presuppose a conscious intention” {102}.</p>
<a id="246"></a>
<p class="fst">What, then, is adaptation without conscious intention, without
the mediation of ideas, which he so zealously opposes, if not such unconscious
purposive activity?</p>
<a id="247"></a>
<p>If therefore tree-frogs and leaf-eating insects are green, desert animals
sandy-yellow, and animals of the polar regions mainly snow-white in colour,
they have certainly not adopted these colours on purpose or in conformity with
any ideas; on the contrary, the colours can only be explained on the basis of
physical forces and chemical agents. And yet it cannot be denied that these
animals, because of those colours, are purposively <i>adapted</i> to the
environment in which they live, in that they have become far less visible to
their enemies. In just the same way the organs with which certain plants seize
and devour insects alighting on them are adapted to this action, and even
purposively adapted. Consequently, if Herr Dühring insists that this adaptation
must be effected through ideas, he as much as says, only in other words, that
purposive activity must also be brought about through ideas, must be conscious
and intentional. And this brings us, as is usually the case in his philosophy
of reality, to a purposive creator, to God.</p>
<a id="248"></a>
<p class="quoted">“An explanation of this kind used to be called deism, and was
not thought much of” — Herr Dühring tells us — “but on this matter,
too, views now seem to have been reversed” {111}.</p>
<a id="249"></a>
<p class="fst">From adaptation we now pass on to heredity. Here likewise,
according to Herr Dühring, Darwinism is completely on the wrong track. The
whole organic world, Darwin is said to have asserted, descended from one
primordial being, is so to speak the progeny of one single being. Dühring
states that, in Darwin's view, there is no such thing as the independent
parallel lines of homogeneous products of nature unless mediated by common
descent; and that therefore Darwin and his retrospectively directed views had
perforce to come to an end at the point where the thread of begetting, or other
form of propagation, breaks off {111}.</p>
<a id="250"></a>
<p>The assertion that Darwin traced all existing organisms back to <i>one</i>
primordial being is, to put it politely, a product of Herr Dühring's <span class="duhring">“own free creation and imagination”</span> {43}. Darwin
expressly says on the last page but one of his <i>Origin of species</i>,
sixth edition, that he regards</p>
<a id="251"></a>
<p class="quoted">“all beings not as special creations, but as the lineal
descendants <i>of some few beings</i>”.</p>
<a id="252"></a>
<p class="fst">And Haeckel even goes considerably further, assuming</p>
<a id="253"></a>
<p class="quoted">“a quite independent stock for the vegetable kingdom, and a
second for the animal kingdom”, and between the two “a number of independent
stocks of Protista, each of which, quite independently of the former, has
developed out of one special archegone of the moneron type” <a href="footnotes.html#n40" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[40]</sup></a>
(<i>Schöpfungsgeschichte</i>, p. 397)</p>
<a id="254"></a>
<p class="fst">This primordial being was only invented by Dühring in order to
bring it into as great disrepute as possible by drawing a parallel with the
primordial Jew {D. Ph. 110} Adam, and in this he — that is to say, Herr
Dühring — suffers the misfortune of not having the faintest idea that
this primordial Jew had been shown by Smith's Assyrian discoveries <a href="footnotes.html#n41" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[41]</sup></a> to have been a
primordial Semite, and that the whole biblical history of creation and the
flood turns out to be a part of the old heathen religious myths which the Jew
have in common with the Babylonians, Chaldeans and Assyrians.</p>
<a id="255"></a>
<p>It is certainly a bitter reproach against Darwin, and one for which he has
no defence, that he comes to an end at once at the point where the thread of
descent breaks off. Unfortunately it is a reproach which has been earned by the
whole of our natural science. Where the thread of descent breaks off for it, it
“ends”. It has not yet succeeded in producing organic beings without descent
from others; indeed, it has not yet succeeded even in producing simple
protoplasm or other albuminous bodies out of chemical elements. With regard to
the origin of life, therefore, up to the present, natural science is only able
to say with certainty that it must have been the result of chemical action.
However, perhaps the philosophy of reality is in a position to give some help
on this point as it has at its disposal independent parallel lines of products
of nature not mediated by common descent. How can these have come into
existence? By spontaneous generation? But up to now even the most audacious
advocates of spontaneous generation have not claimed that this produced
anything but bacteria, embryonic fungi and other very primitive organisms
— no insects, fishes, birds or mammals. But if these homogeneous products
of nature — organic, of course, as here we are only dealing with these
— are not connected by descent, they or each of their ancestors must, at
the point <span class="duhring">“where the thread of descent breaks
off”</span>, have been put into the world by a separate act of creation. So we
arrive once again at a creator and at what is called deism.</p>
<a id="256"></a>
<p>Herr Dühring further declares that it was very superficial on Darwin's
part</p>
<a id="257"></a>
<p class="quoted">“to make the mere act of the sexual composition of properties
the fundamental principle of the origin of these properties” {116}.</p>
<a id="258"></a>
<p class="fst">This is another free creation and imagination of our deep-rooted
philosopher. Darwin definitely states the opposite: the expression natural
selection only implies the <i>preservation</i> of variations, not their
origin (p. 63). This new imputation to Darwin of things he never said
nevertheless helps us to grasp the following depth of Dühringian mentality:</p>
<a id="259"></a>
<p class="quoted">“If some principle of independent variation had been found in
the inner schematism of generation, this idea would have been quite rational;
for it is a natural idea to combine the principle of universal genesis with
that of sexual propagation into a unity, and to regard so-called spontaneous
generation, from a higher standpoint, not as the absolute antithesis of
reproduction but just as a production” {116}.</p>
<a id="260"></a>
<p class="fst">And the man who can write such rubbish is not ashamed to
reproach Hegel for his “jargon” {D. K. G. 491}!</p>
<a id="261"></a>
<p>But enough of the peevish, contradictory grumbling and nagging through which
Herr Dühring gives vent to his anger at the colossal impetus which natural
science owes to the driving force of the Darwinian theory. Neither Darwin nor
his followers among naturalists ever think of belittling in any way the great
services rendered by Lamarck; in fact, they are the very people who first put
him up again on his pedestal. But we must not overlook the fact that in
Lamarck’s time science was as yet far from being in possession of sufficient
material to have enabled it to answer the question of the origin of species
except in an anticipatory way, prophetically, as it were. In addition to the
enormous mass of material, both of descriptive and anatomical botany and
zoology, which has accumulated in the intervening period, two completely new
sciences have arisen since Lamarck’s time, and these are of decisive importance
on this question: research into the development of plant and animal germs
(embryology) and research into the organic remains preserved in the various
strata of the earth’s surface (palaeontology). There is in fact a peculiar
correspondence between the gradual development of organic germs into mature
organisms and the succession of plants and animals following each other in the
history of the earth. And it is precisely this correspondence which has given
the theory of evolution its most secure basis. The theory of evolution itself
is however still in a very early stage, and it therefore cannot be doubted that
further research will greatly modify our present conceptions, including
strictly Darwinian ones, of the process of the evolution of species.</p>
<a id="262"></a>
<p>What, of a positive character, has the philosophy of reality to tell us
concerning the evolution of organic life?</p>
<a id="263"></a>
<p class="quoted">“The ... variability of species is a presupposition which can
be accepted” {D. Ph. 115}. But alongside it there hold also “the independent
parallel lines of homogeneous products of nature, not mediated by common
descent” {111}.</p>
<a id="264"></a>
<p class="fst">From this we are apparently to infer that the heterogeneous
products of nature, i.e., the species which show variations, descend from each
other but not so the homogeneous products. But this is not altogether correct
either; for even with species which show variations,</p>
<a id="265"></a>
<p class="quoted">“mediation by common descent is on the contrary quite a
secondary act of nature” {114}.</p>
<a id="266"></a>
<p class="fst">So we get common descent after all, but only “second class”. We
must rejoice that after Herr Dühring has attributed so much to it that is evil
and obscure, we nevertheless find it in the end readmitted by the backdoor. It
is the same with natural selection, for after all his moral indignation over
the struggle for existence through which natural selection operates we suddenly
read:</p>
<a id="267"></a>
<p class="quoted">“The deeper basis of the constitution of organisms is thus to
be sought in the conditions of life and cosmic relations, while the natural
selection emphasised by Darwin can only come in as a secondary factor”
{115}.</p>
<a id="268"></a>
<p class="fst">So we get natural selection after all, though only second class;
and along with natural selection also the struggle for existence, and with that
also the priestly Malthusian overpopulation! That is all, and for the rest Herr
Dühring refers us to Lamarck.</p>
<a id="269"></a>
<p>In conclusion he warns us against the misuse of the terms: metamorphosis and
development. Metamorphosis, he maintains, is an <span class="duhring">unclear
concept</span> {112}, and the concept of development is permissible only in so
far as laws of development can be really established {126}. In place of both
these terms we should use the term <span class="duhring">“composition”</span>
{114}, and then everything would be all right. It is the same old story over
again: things remain as they were, and Herr Dühring is quite satisfied as soon
as we just alter the names. When we speak of the development of the chicken in
the egg we are creating confusion, for we are able to prove the laws of;
development only in an incomplete way. But if we speak of its’ “composition”
everything becomes clear. We shall therefore no longer say: This child is
developing finely but: It is composing itself magnificently. We can
congratulate Herr Dühring on being a worthy peer of the author of the
<i>Nibelungenring</i> not only in his noble self-esteem but also in his
capacity of composer of the future. <a href="footnotes.html#n42" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[42]</sup></a></p>

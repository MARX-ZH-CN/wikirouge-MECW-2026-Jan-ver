Part III: Socialism</p>
<a id="c2"></a>
<h1>II. Theoretical</h1>
<p class="fst">The materialist conception of history starts from the
proposition that the production and, next to production, the exchange of things
produced, is the basis of all social structure; that in every society that has
appeared in history, the manner in which wealth is distributed and society
divided into classes or estates is dependent upon what is produced, how it is
produced, and how the products are exchanged. From this point of view the final
causes of all social changes and political revolutions are to be sought, not in
men's brains, not in man's better insight into eternal truth and justice, but
in changes in the modes of production and exchange. They are to be sought, not
in the <i>philosophy</i>, but in the <i>economics</i> of each particular
epoch. The growing perception that existing social institutions are
unreasonable and unjust, that reason has become unreason, and right wrong, is
only proof that in the modes of production and exchange changes have silently
taken place with which the social order, adapted to earlier economic
conditions, is no longer in keeping. From this it also follows that the means
of getting rid of the incongruities that have been brought to light must also
be present, in a more or less developed condition, within the changed modes of
production themselves. These means are not to be <i>invented</i>, spun out of
the head, but <i>discovered</i> with the aid of the head in the existing
material facts of production. <a id="034"></a></p>
<p>What is, then, the position of modern socialism in this connection? <a id="035"></a></p>
<p>The present structure of society — this is now pretty generally
conceded — is the creation of the ruling class of today, of the
bourgeoisie. The mode of production peculiar to the bourgeoisie, known, since
Marx, as the capitalist mode of production, was incompatible with the local
privileges and the privileges of estate as well as with the reciprocal personal
ties of the feudal system. The bourgeoisie broke up the feudal system and built
upon its ruins the capitalist order of society, the kingdom of free.
competition, of personal liberty, of the equality, before the law, of all
commodity owners, of all the rest of the capitalist blessings. Thenceforward
the capitalist mode of production could develop in freedom. Since steam,
machinery, and the making of machines by machinery transformed the older
manufacture into modern industry, the productive forces evolved under the
guidance of the bourgeoisie developed with a rapidity and in a degree unheard
of before. But just as the older manufacture, in its time, and handicraft,
becoming more developed under its influence, had come into- collision with the
feudal trammels of the guilds, so now modern industry, in its more complete
development, comes into collision with the bounds within which the capitalistic
mode of production holds it confined. The new productive forces have already
outgrown the capitalistic mode of using them. And this conflict between
productive forces and modes of production is not a conflict engendered in the
mind of man, like that between original sin and divine justice. It exists, in
fact, objectively, outside us, independently of the will and actions even of
the men that have brought it on. Modern socialism is nothing but the reflex, in
thought, of this conflict in fact; its ideal reflection in the minds, first, of
the class directly suffering under it, the working class. <a id="036"></a></p>
<p>Now, in what does this conflict consist? <a id="037"></a></p>
<p>Before capitalistic production, i.e., in the Middle Ages, the system of
petty industry obtained generally, based upon the private property of the
labourers in their means of production; {in the country,} the agriculture of
the small peasant, freeman or serf; in the towns, the handicrafts. The
instruments of labour — land, agricultural implements, the workshop, the
tool — were the instruments of labour of single individuals, adapted for
the use of one worker, and, therefore, of necessity, small, dwarfish,
circumscribed. But, for this very reason they belonged, as a rule, to the
producer himself. To concentrate these scattered, limited means of production,
to enlarge them, to turn them into the powerful levers of production of the
present day — this was precisely the historic role of capitalist
production and of its upholder, the bourgeoisie. In Part IV of
<i>Capital</i>, Marx has explained in detail, how since the fifteenth century
this has been historically worked out through the three phases of simple
co-operation, manufacture and modern industry. But the bourgeoisie, as is also
shown there, could not transform these puny means of production into mighty
productive forces without transforming them, at the same time, from means of
production of the individual into <i>social</i> means of production only
workable by a <i>collectivity of men.</i> The spinning-wheel, the hand-loom,
the blacksmith's hammer, were replaced by the spinning-machine, the power-loom,
the steam-hammer; the individual workshop by the factory implying the
co-operation of hundreds and thousands of workmen. In like manner, production
itself changed from a series of individual into a series of social acts, and
the products from individual to social products. The yarn, the cloth, the metal
articles that now came out of the factory were the joint product of many
workers, through whose hands they had successively to pass before they were
ready. No one person could say of them: “I made that; this is <i>my</i>
product.” <a id="038"></a></p>
<p>But where, in a given society, the fundamental form of production is that
spontaneous division of labour, there the products take on the form of
<i>commodities</i> whose mutual exchange, buying and selling, enable the
individual producers to satisfy their manifold wants. And this was the case in
the Middle Ages. The peasant, e.g., sold to the artisan agricultural products
and bought from him the products of handicraft. Into this society of individual
producers, of commodity producers, the new mode of production thrust itself. In
the midst of the old division of labour, grown up spontaneously and upon <i>no
definite plan</i>, which had governed the whole of society, now arose division
of labour upon <i>a definite plan</i>, as organised in the factory; side by
side with <i>individual</i> production appeared <i>social</i> production.
The products of both were sold in the same market, and, therefore, at prices at
least approximately equal. But organisation upon a definite plan was stronger
than spontaneous division of labour. The factories working with the combined
social forces of a collectivity of individuals produced their commodities far
more cheaply than the individual small producers. Individual production
succumbed in one department after another. Socialised production revolutionised
all the old methods of production. But its revolutionary character was, at the
same time, so little recognised that it was, on the contrary, introduced as a
means of increasing and developing the production of commodities. When it
arose, it found readymade, and made liberal use of, certain machinery for the
production and exchange of commodities: merchants' capital, handicraft,
wage-labour. Socialised production thus introducing itself as a new form of the
production of commodities, it was a matter of course that under it the old
forms of appropriation remained in full swing, and were applied to its products
as well. <a id="039"></a></p>
<p>In the mediaeval stage of evolution of the production of commodities, the
question as to the owner of the product of labour could not arise. The
individual producer, as a rule, had, from raw material belonging to himself,
and generally his own handiwork, produced it with his own tools, by the labour
of his own hands or of his family. There was no need for him to appropriate the
new product. It belonged wholly to him, as a matter of course. His property in
the product was, therefore, based <i>upon his own labour.</i> Even where
external help was used, this was, as a rule, of little importance, and very
generally was compensated by something other than wages. The apprentices and
journeymen of the guilds worked less for board and wages than for education, in
order that they might become master craftsmen themselves. Then came the
concentration of the means of production in large workshops and manufactories,
their transformation into actual socialised means of production. But the
socialised means of production and their products were still treated, after
this change, just as they had been before, i.e., as the means of production and
the products of individuals. Hitherto, the owner of the instruments of labour
had himself appropriated the product, because, as a rule, it was his own
product and the assistance of others was the exception. Now the owner of the
instruments of labour always appropriated to himself the product, although it
was no longer <i>his</i> product but exclusively the product of the
<i>labour of others.</i> Thus, the products now produced socially were not
appropriated by those who had actually set in motion the means of production
and actually produced the commodities, but by the <i>capitalists.</i> The
means of production, and production itself had become in essence socialised.
But they were subjected to a form of appropriation which presupposes the
private production of individuals, under which, therefore, everyone owns his
own product and brings it to market. The mode of production is subjected to
this form of appropriation, although it abolishes the conditions upon which the
latter rests. <a href="notes.html#n*8" target=_blank><sup class="enote">*8</sup></a> This
contradiction, which gives to the new mode of production its capitalistic
character, <i>contains the germ of the whole of the social antagonisms of
today.</i> The greater the mastery obtained by the new mode of production over
all decisive fields of production and in all economically decisive countries,
the more it reduced individual production to an insignificant residium, <i>the
more clearly was brought out the incompatibility of socialised production with
capitalistic appropriation.</i> <a id="040"></a></p>
<p>The first capitalists found, as we have said, wage-labour ready-made for
them. But it was exceptional, complementary, accessory, transitory wage-labour.
The agricultural labourer, though, upon occasion, he hired himself out by the
day, had a few acres of his own land on which he could at all events live at a
pinch. The guilds were so organised that the journeyman of today became the
master of tomorrow. But all this changed, as soon as the means of production
became socialised and concentrated in the hands of capitalists. The means of
production, as well as the product, of the individual producer became more and
more worthless; there was nothing left for him but to turn wage-worker under
the capitalist. Wage-labour, aforetime the exception and accessory, now became
the rule and basis of all production; aforetime complementary, it now became
the sole remaining function of the worker. The wage-worker for a time became a
wage-worker for life. The number of these permanent wageworkers was further
enormously increased by the breaking-up of the feudal system that occurred at
the same time, by the disbanding of the retainers of the feudal lords, the
eviction of the peasants from their homesteads, etc. The separation was made
complete between the means of production concentrated in the hands of the
capitalists, on the one side, and the producers, possessing nothing but their
labour-power, on the other. <i>The contradiction between socialised production
and capitalistic appropriation manifested itself as the antagonism of
proletariat and bourgeoisie.</i> <a id="041"></a></p>
<p>We have seen that the capitalistic mode of production thrust its way into a
society of commodity producers, of individual producers, whose social bond was
the exchange of their products. But every society based upon the production of
commodities has this peculiarity: that the producers have lost control over
their own social interrelations. Each man produces for himself with such means
of production as he may happen to have, and for such exchange as he may require
to satisfy his remaining wants. No one knows how much of his particular article
is coming on the market, nor how much of it will be wanted. No one knows
whether his individual product will meet an actual demand, whether he will be
able to make good his costs of production or even to sell his commodity at all.
Anarchy reigns in socialised production. But the production of commodities,
like every other form of production, has its peculiar, inherent laws
inseparable from it; and these laws work, despite anarchy, in and through
anarchy. They reveal themselves in the only persistent form of social
interrelations, i.e., in exchange, and here they affect the individual
producers as compulsory laws of competition. They are, at first, unknown to
these producers themselves, and have to be discovered by them gradually and as
the result of experience. They work themselves out, therefore, independently of
the producers, and in antagonism to them, as inexorable natural laws of their
particular form of production. The product governs the producers. <a id="042"></a></p>
<p>In mediaeval society, especially in the earlier centuries, production was
essentially directed towards satisfying the wants of the individual. It
satisfied, in the main, only the wants of the producer and his family. Where
relations of personal dependence existed, as in the country, it also helped to
satisfy the wants of the feudal lord. In all this there was, therefore, no
exchange; the products, consequently, did not assume the character of
commodities. The family of the peasant produced almost everything they wanted:
clothes and furniture, as well as means of subsistence. Only when it began to
produce more than was sufficient to supply its own wants and the payments in
kind to the feudal lord, only then did it also produce commodities. This
surplus, thrown into socialised exchange and offered for sale, became
commodities. The artisans of the towns, it is true, had from the first to
produce for exchange. But they, also, themselves supplied the greatest part of
their own individual wants. They had gardens and plots of land. They turned
their cattle out into the communal forest, which also, yielded them timber and
firing. The women spun flax, wool, and so forth. Production for the purpose of
exchange, production of commodities, was only in its infancy. Hence, exchange
was restricted, the market narrow, the methods of production stable; there was
local exclusiveness without, local unity within, the mark <a href="footnotes.html#n114" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[114]</sup></a> in the country; in
the town, the guild. <a id="043"></a></p>
<p>But with the extension of the production of commodities, and especially with
the introduction of the capitalist mode of production, the laws of commodity
production, hitherto latent, came into action more openly and with greater
force. The old bonds were loosened, the old exclusive limits broken through,
the producers were more and more turned into independent, isolated producers of
commodities. The anarchy of social production became apparent and grew to
greater and greater height. But the chief means by aid of which the capitalist
mode of production intensified this anarchy of socialised production was the
exact opposite of anarchy. It was the increasing organisation of production,
upon a social basis, in every individual productive establishment. By this, the
old, peaceful, stable condition of things was ended. Wherever this organisation
of production was introduced into a branch of industry, it brooked no other
method of production by its side. Where it laid hold of a handicraft, that old
handicraft was wiped out. The field of labour became a battle-ground. The great
geographical discoveries, and the colonisation following upon them, multiplied
markets and quickened the transformation of handicraft into manufacture. The
war did not simply break out between the individual producers of particular
localities. The local struggles begot in their turn national conflicts, the
commercial wars of the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries. <a href="footnotes.html#n115" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[115]</sup></a> Finally, modern
industry and the opening of the world market made the struggle universal, and
at the same time gave it an unheard-of virulence. Advantages in natural or
artificial conditions of production now decide the existence or non-existence
of individual capitalists, as well as of whole industries and countries. He
that falls is remorselessly cast aside. It is the Darwinian struggle of the
individual for existence transferred from nature to society with intensified
violence. The conditions of existence natural to the animal appear as the final
term of human development. The contradiction between socialised production and
capitalistic appropriation now presents itself as <i>an antagonism between the
organisation of production in the individual workshop</i>, <i>and the anarchy
of production in society generally.</i> <a id="044"></a></p>
<p>The capitalistic mode of production moves in these two forms of the
antagonism immanent to it from its very origin. It is never able to get out of
that "vicious circle" which Fourier had already discovered. What Fourier could
not, indeed, see in his time is that this circle is gradually narrowing; that
the movement becomes more and more a spiral, and must come to an end, like the
movement of the planets, by collision with the centre. It is the compelling
force of anarchy in the production of society at large that more and more
completely turns the great majority of men into proletarians; and it is the
masses of the proletariat again who will finally put an end to anarchy in
production. It is the compelling force of anarchy in social production that
turns the limitless perfectibility of machinery under modern industry into a
compulsory law by which every individual industrial capitalist must perfect his
machinery more and more, under penalty of ruin. But the perfecting of machinery
is making human labour superfluous. If the introduction and increase of
machinery means the displacement of millions of manual by a few
machine-workers, improvement in machinery means the displacement of more and
more of the machine-workers themselves. It means, in the last instance, the
production of a number of available wage-workers in excess of the average needs
of capital, the formation of a complete industrial reserve army, as I called it
in 1845, <a href="notes.html#n*9" target=_blank><sup class="enote">*9</sup></a> available at
the times when industry is working at high pressure, to be cast out upon the
street when the inevitable crash comes, a constant dead-weight upon the limbs
of the working class in its struggle for existence with capital, a regulator
for the keeping of wages down to the low level that suits the interests of
capital. Thus it comes about, to quote Marx, that machinery becomes the most
powerful weapon in the war of capital against the working class; that the
instruments of labour constantly tear the means of subsistence out of the hands
of the labourer; that the very product of the worker is turned into an
instrument for his subjugation. Thus it comes about that the economising of the
instruments of labour becomes at the same time, from the outset, the most
reckless waste of labour-power, and robbery based upon the normal conditions
under which labour functions; that machinery, the most powerful instrument for
shortening labour-time, becomes the most unfailing means for placing every
moment of the labourer's time and that of his family at the disposal of the
capitalist for the purpose of expanding the value of his capital. Thus it comes
about that the overwork of some becomes the preliminary condition for the
idleness of others, and that modern industry, which hunts after new consumers
over the whole world, forces the consumption of the masses at home down to a
starvation minimum, and in doing this destroys its own home market. “The
law that always equilibrates the relative surplus-population, or industrial
reserve army, to the extent and energy of accumulation, this law rivets the
labourer to capital more firmly than the wedges of Vulcan did Prometheus to the
rock. It establishes an accumulation of misery corresponding with accumulation
of capital. Accumulation of wealth at one pole is, therefore, at the same time
accumulation of misery, agony of toil, slavery, ignorance, brutality, mental
degradation, at the opposite pole, i.e., on the side of the class that
<i>produces its own product in the form of capital”</i> (Marx’s
<i>Capital</i>, p. 671.) And to expect any other division of the products
from the capitalistic mode of production is the same as expecting the
electrodes of a battery not to decompose acidulated water, not to liberate
oxygen at the positive, hydrogen at the negative pole, so long as they are
connected with the battery. <a id="045"></a></p>
<p>We have seen that the ever increasing perfectibility of modern machinery is,
by the anarchy of social production, turned into a compulsory law that forces
the individual industrial capitalist always to improve his machinery, always to
increase its productive force. The bare possibility of extending the field of
production is transformed for him into a similar compulsory law. The enormous
expansive force of modern industry, compared with which that of gases is mere
child’s play, appears to us now as a <i>necessity</i> for expansion,
both qualitative and quantitative, that laughs at all resistance. Such
resistance is offered by consumption, by sales, by the markets for the products
of modern industry. But the capacity for extension, extensive and intensive, of
the markets is primarily governed by quite different laws that work much less
energetically. The extension of the markets cannot keep pace with the extension
of production. The collision becomes inevitable, and as this cannot produce any
real solution so long as it does not break in pieces the capitalist mode of
production, the collisions become periodic. Capitalist production has begotten
another “vicious circle”. <a id="046"></a></p>
<p>As a matter of fact, since 1825, when the first general crisis broke out,
the whole industrial and commercial world, production and exchange among all
civilised peoples and their more or less barbaric hangers-on, are thrown out of
joint about once every ten years. Commerce is at a standstill, the markets are
glutted, products accumulate, as multitudinous as they are unsaleable, hard
cash disappears, credit vanishes, factories are closed, the mass of the workers
are in want of the means of subsistence, because they have produced too much of
the means of subsistence; bankruptcy follows upon bankruptcy, execution upon
execution. The stagnation lasts for years; productive forces and products are
wasted and destroyed wholesale, until the accumulated mass of commodities
finally filters off, more or less depreciated in value, until production and
exchange gradually begin to move again. Little by little the pace quickens. It
becomes a trot. The industrial trot breaks into a canter, the canter in turn
grows into the headlong gallop of a perfect steeplechase of industry,
commercial credit, and speculation, which finally, after break-neck leaps, ends
where it began — in the ditch of a crisis. And so over and over again. We
have now, since the year 1825, gone through this five times, and at the present
moment (1877) we are going through it for the sixth time. And the character of
these crises is so clearly defined that Fourier hit all of them off when he
described the first as <i>crise plethorique</i>, a crisis from plethora. <a id="047"></a></p>
<p>In these crises, the contradiction between socialised production and
capitalist appropriation ends in a violent explosion. The circulation of
commodities is, for the time being, stopped. Money, the means of circulation,
becomes a hindrance to circulation. All the laws of production and circulation
of commodities are turned upside down. The economic collision has reached its
apogee. <i>The mode of production is in rebellion against the mode of
exchange</i>, <i>the productive forces are in rebellion against the mode of
production which they have outgrown.</i> <a id="048"></a></p>
<p>The fact that the socialised organisation of production within the factory
has developed so far that it has become incompatible with the anarchy of
production in society, which exists side by side with and dominates it, is
brought home to the capitalists themselves by the violent concentration of
capital that occurs during crises, through the ruin of many large, and a still
greater number of small, capitalists. The whole mechanism of the capitalist
mode of production breaks down under the pressure of the productive forces, its
own creations. It is no longer able to turn all this mass of means of
production into capital. They lie fallow, and for that very reason the
industrial reserve army must also lie fallow. Means of production, means of
subsistence, available labourers, all the elements of production and of general
wealth, are present in abundance. But “abundance becomes the source of
distress and want” (Fourier), because it is the very thing that prevents
the transformation of the means of production and subsistence into capital. For
in capitalistic society the means of production can only function when they
have undergone a preliminary transformation into capital, into the means of
exploiting human labour-power. The necessity of this transformation into
capital of the means of production and subsistence stands like a ghost between
these and the workers. It alone prevents the coming together of the material
and personal levers of production; it alone forbids the means of production to
function, the workers to work and live. On the one hand, therefore, the
capitalistic mode of production stands convicted of its own incapacity to
further direct these productive forces. On the other, these productive forces
themselves, with increasing energy, press forward to the removal of the
existing contradiction, to the abolition of their quality as capital, <i>to
the practical recognition of their character as social productive forces.</i>
<a id="049"></a></p>
<p>This rebellion of the productive forces, as they grow more and more
powerful, against their quality as capital, this stronger and stronger command
that their social character shall be recognised, forces the capitalist class
itself to treat them more and more as social productive forces, so far as this
is possible under capitalist conditions. The period of industrial high
pressure, with its unbounded inflation of credit, not less than the crash
itself, by the collapse of great capitalist establishments, tends to bring
about that form of the socialisation of great masses of means of production
which we meet with in the different kinds of joint-stock companies. Many of
these means of production and of communication are, from the outset, so
colossal that, like the railways, they exclude all other forms of capitalistic
exploitation. At a further stage of evolution this form also becomes
insufficient: the official representative of capitalist society — the
state — will ultimately have to <a href="notes.html#n*10" target=_blank><sup class="enote">*10</sup></a> undertake the direction of production. This
necessity for conversion into state property is felt first in the great
institutions for intercourse and communication — the post office, the
telegraphs, the railways. <a id="050"></a></p>
<p>If the crises demonstrate the incapacity of the bourgeoisie for managing any
longer modern productive forces, the transformation of the great establishments
for production and distribution into joint-stock companies and state property
shows how unnecessary the bourgeoisie are for that purpose. All the social
functions of the capitalist are now performed by salaried employees. The
capitalist has no further social function than that of pocketing dividends,
tearing off coupons, and gambling on the Stock Exchange, where the different
capitalists despoil one another of their capital. At first the capitalist mode
of production forces out the workers. Now it forces out the capitalists, and
reduces them, just as it reduced the workers, to the ranks of the surplus
population, although not immediately into those of the industrial reserve army.
<a id="051"></a></p>
<p>But the transformation, either into joint-stock companies, or into state
ownership, does not do away with the capitalistic nature of the productive
forces. In the joint-stock companies this is obvious. And the modern state,
again, is only the organisation that bourgeois society takes on in order to
support the general external conditions of the capitalist mode of production
against the encroachments as well of the workers as of individual capitalists.
The modern state, no matter what its form, is essentially a capitalist machine,
the state of the capitalists, the ideal personification of the total national
capital. The more it proceeds to the taking over of productive forces, the more
does it actually become the national capitalist, the more citizens does it
exploit. The workers remain wage-workers — proletarians. The capitalist
relation is not done away with. It is rather brought to a head. But, brought to
a head, it topples over. State ownership of the productive forces is not the
solution of the conflict, but concealed within it are the technical conditions
that form the elements of that solution. <a id="052"></a></p>
<p>This solution can only consist in the practical recognition of the social
nature of the modern forces of production, and therefore in the harmonising of
the modes of production, appropriation, and exchange with the socialised
character of the means of production And this can only come about by society
openly and directly taking possession of the productive forces which have
outgrown all control except that of society as a whole. The social character of
the means of production and of the products today reacts against the producers,
periodically disrupts all production and exchange, acts only like a law of
nature working blindly, forcibly, destructively. But with the taking over by
society of the productive forces, the social character of the means of
production and of the products will be utilised by the producers with a perfect
understanding of its nature, and instead of being a source of disturbance and
periodical collapse, will become the most powerful lever of production itself.
<a id="053"></a></p>
<p>Active social forces work exactly like natural forces: blindly, forcibly,
destructively, so long as we do not understand, and reckon with them. But when
once we understand them, when once we grasp their action, their direction,
their effects, it depends only upon ourselves to subject them more and more to
our own will, and by means of them to reach our own ends. And this holds quite
especially of the mighty productive forces of today. As long as we obstinately
refuse to understand the nature and the character of these social means of
action — and this understanding goes against the grain of the capitalist
mode of production and its defenders — so long these forces are at work
in spite of us, in opposition to us, so long they master us, as we have shown
above in detail. But when once their nature is understood, they can, in the
hands of the producers working together, be transformed from master demons into
willing servants. The difference is as that between the destructive force of
electricity in the lightning of the storm, and electricity under command in the
telegraph and the voltaic arc; the difference between a conflagration, and fire
working in the service of man. With this recognition, at last, of the real
nature of the productive forces of today, the social anarchy of production
gives place to a social regulation of production upon a definite plan,
according to the needs of the community and of each individual. Then the
capitalist mode of appropriation, in which the product enslaves first the
producer and then the appropriator, is replaced by the mode of appropriation of
the products that is based upon the nature of the modern means of production:
upon the one hand, direct social appropriation, as means to the maintenance and
extension of production — on the other, direct individual appropriation,
as means of subsistence and of enjoyment. <a id="054"></a></p>
<p>Whilst the capitalist mode of production more and more completely transforms
the great majority of the population into proletarians, it creates the power
which, under penalty of its own destruction, is forced to accomplish this
revolution. Whilst it forces on more and more the transformation of the vast
means of production, already socialised, into state property, it shows itself
the way to accomplishing this revolution. <i>The proletariat seizes political
power and turns the means of production in the first instance into state
property.</i> But, in doing this, it abolishes itself as proletariat,
abolishes all class distinctions and class antagonisms, abolishes also the
state as state. Society thus far, based upon class antagonisms, had need of the
state, that is, of an organisation of the particular class, which was <i>pro
tempore</i> the exploiting class, for the maintenance of its external
conditions of production, and, therefore, especially, for the purpose of
forcibly keeping the exploited classes in the condition of oppression
corresponding with the given mode of production (slavery, serfdom,
wage-labour). The state was the official representative of society as a whole;
the gathering of it together into a visible embodiment. But it was this only in
so far as it was the state of that class which itself represented, for the time
being, society as a whole: in ancient times, the state of slave-owning
citizens; in the Middle Ages, the feudal lords; in our own time, the
bourgeoisie. When at last it becomes the real representative of the whole of
society, it renders itself unnecessary. As soon as there is no longer any
social class to be held in subjection; as soon as class rule, and the
individual struggle for existence based upon our present anarchy in production,
with the collisions and excesses arising from these, are removed, nothing more
remains to be repressed, and a special repressive force, a state, is no longer
necessary. The first act by virtue of which the state really constitutes itself
the representative of the whole of society — the taking possession of the
means of production in the name of society — this is, at the same time,
its last independent act as a state. State interference in social relations
becomes, in one domain after another, superfluous, and then dies out of itself;
the government of persons is replaced by the administration of things, and by
the conduct of processes of production. The state is not "abolished". <i>It
dies out.</i> This gives the measure of the value of the phrase "a free
people's state", both as to its justifiable use at times by agitators, and as
to its ultimate scientific insufficiency <a href="footnotes.html#n117" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[117]</sup></a>; and also of the demands of the so-called
anarchists for the abolition of the state out of hand. <a id="055"></a></p>
<p>Since the historical appearance of the capitalist mode of production, the
appropriation by society of all the means of production has often been dreamed
of, more or less vaguely, by individuals, as well as by sects, as the ideal of
the future. But it could become possible, could become a historical necessity,
only when the actual conditions for its realisation were there. Like every
other social advance, it becomes practicable, not by men understanding that the
existence of classes is in contradiction to justice, equality, etc., not by the
mere willingness to abolish these classes, but by virtue of certain new
economic conditions. The separation of society into an exploiting and an
exploited class, a ruling and an oppressed class, was the necessary consequence
of the deficient and restricted development of production in former times. So
long as the total social labour only yields a produce which but slightly
exceeds that barely necessary for the existence of all; so long, therefore, as
labour engages all or almost all the time of the great majority of the members
of society — so long, of necessity, this society is divided into classes.
Side by side with the great majority, exclusively bond slaves to labour, arises
a class freed from directly productive labour, which looks after the general
affairs of society: the direction of labour, state business, law, science, art,
etc. It is, therefore, the law of division of labour that lies at the basis of
the division into classes. But this does not prevent this division into classes
from being carried out by means of violence and robbery, trickery and fraud. It
does not prevent the ruling class, once having the upper hand, from
consolidating its power at the expense of the working class, from turning its
social leadership into an exploitation of the masses. <a id="056"></a></p>
<p>But if, upon this showing, division into classes has a certain historical
justification, it has this only for a given period, only under given social
conditions. It was based upon the insufficiency of production. It will be swept
away by the complete development of modern productive forces. And, in fact, the
abolition of classes in society presupposes a degree of historical evolution at
which the existence, not simply of this or that particular ruling class, but of
any ruling class at all, and, therefore, the existence of class distinction
itself has become an obsolete anachronism. It presupposes, therefore, the
development of production carried out to a degree at which appropriation of the
means of production and of the products, and, with this, of political
domination, of the monopoly of culture, and of intellectual leadership by a
particular class of society, has become not only superfluous but economically,
politically, intellectually a hindrance to development. This point is now
reached. Their political and intellectual bankruptcy is scarcely any longer a
secret to the bourgeoisie themselves. Their economic bankruptcy recurs
regularly every ten years. In every crisis, society is suffocated beneath the
weight of its own productive forces and products, which it cannot use, and
stands helpless face to face with the absurd contradiction that the producers
have nothing to consume, because consumers are wanting. The expansive force of
the means of production bursts the bonds that the capitalist mode of production
had imposed upon them. Their deliverance from these bonds is the one
precondition for an unbroken, constantly accelerated development of the
productive forces, and therewith for a practically unlimited increase of
production itself. Nor is this all. The socialised appropriation of the means
of production does away, not only with the present artificial restrictions upon
production, but also with the positive waste and devastation of productive
forces and products that are at the present time the inevitable concomitants of
production, and that reach their height in the crises. Further, it sets free
for the community at large a mass of means of production and of products, by
doing away with the senseless extravagance of the ruling classes of today and
their political representatives. The possibility of securing for every member
of society, by means of socialised production, an existence not only fully
sufficient materially, and becoming day by day more full, but an existence
guaranteeing to all the free development and exercise of their physical and
mental faculties — this possibility is now for the first time here, but
it is <i>here</i>. <a href="notes.html#n*11" target=_blank><sup class="enote">*11</sup></a>
<a id="057"></a></p>
<p>With the seizing of the means of production by society production of
commodities is done away with, and, simultaneously, the mastery of the product
over the producer. Anarchy in social production is replaced by systematic,
definite organisation. The struggle for individual existence disappears. Then
for the first time man, in a certain sense, is finally marked off from the rest
of the animal kingdom, and emerges from mere animal conditions of existence
into really human ones. The whole sphere of the conditions of life which
environ man, and which have hitherto ruled man, now comes under the dominion
and control of man who for the first time becomes the real, conscious lord of
nature because he has now become master of his own social organisation. The
laws of his own social action, hitherto standing face to face with man as laws
of nature foreign to, and dominating him, will then be used with full
understanding, and so mastered by him. Man’s own social organisation,
hitherto confronting him as a necessity imposed by nature and history, now
becomes the result of his own free action. The extraneous objective forces that
have hitherto governed history pass under the control of man himself. Only from
that time will man himself, with full consciousness, make his own history
— only from that time will the social causes set in movement by him have,
in the main and in a constantly growing measure, the results intended by him.
It is the humanity's leap from the kingdom of necessity to the kingdom of
freedom. <a id="058"></a></p>
<p>To accomplish this act of universal emancipation is the historical mission
of the modern proletariat. To thoroughly comprehend the historical conditions
and thus the very nature of this act, to impart to the now oppressed class a
full knowledge of the conditions and of the meaning of the momentous act it is
called upon to accomplish, this is the task of the theoretical expression of
the proletarian movement, scientific socialism. <a id="059"></a></p>

<h4>Prefaces</h4>
<h1>I — London, June 11 1878</h1>
<hr class="end"/>
<p class="fst">The following work is by no means the fruit of any "inner urge".
On the contrary. <a id="002"></a> </p>
<p>When three years ago Herr Dühring, as an adept and at the same time a
reformer of socialism, suddenly issued his challenge to his age, friends in
Germany repeatedly urged on me their desire that I should subject this new
socialist theory to a critical examination in the central organ of the Social
Democratic Party, at that time the <i>Volksstaat.</i> They thought this
absolutely necessary if the occasion for sectarian divisions and confusions
were not once again to arise within the Party, which was still so young and had
but just achieved definite unity. <a href="footnotes.html#n2" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[2]</sup></a> They were in a better position than I was to judge
the situation in Germany, and I was therefore duty bound to accept their view.
Moreover, it became apparent that the new convert was being welcomed by a
section of the socialist press with a warmth which it is true was only extended
to Herr Dühring's good will, but which at the same time also indicated that in
this section of the Party press there existed the good will, precisely on
account of Herr Dühring's good will, to take also, without examination, Herr
Dühring's doctrine into the bargain. <a href="footnotes.html#n3" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[3]</sup></a> There were, besides, people who were already
preparing to spread this doctrine in a popularised form among the workers. <a href="footnotes.html#n4" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[4]</sup></a> And finally Herr
Dühring and his little sect were using all the arts of advertisement and
intrigue to force the <i>Volksstaat</i> to take a definite stand in relation
to the new doctrine which had come forward with such mighty pretensions. <a href="footnotes.html#n5" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[5]</sup></a></p>
<a id="003"></a>
<p>Nevertheless it was a year before I could make up my mind to neglect other
work and get my teeth into this sour apple. It was the kind of apple that, once
bitten into, had to be completely devoured; and it was not only very sour, but
also very large. The new socialist theory was presented as the ultimate
practical fruit of a new philosophical system. It was therefore necessary to
examine it in the context of this system, and in doing so to examine the system
itself; it was necessary to follow Herr Dühring into that vast territory in
which he dealt with all things under the sun and with some others as well. That
was the origin of a series of articles which appeared in the Leipzig
<i>Vorwärts</i>, the successor of the <i>Volksstaat</i>, from the beginning
of 1877 onwards and are here presented as a connected whole.</p>
<a id="004"></a>
<p>It was thus the nature of the object itself which forced the criticism to go
into such detail as is entirely out of proportion to the scientific content of
this object, that is to say, of Dühring's writings. But there are also two
other considerations which may excuse this length of treatment. On the one hand
it gave me, in connection with the very diverse subjects to be touched on here,
the opportunity of setting forth in a positive form my views on controversial
issues which are today of quite general scientific or practical interest. This
has been done in every single chapter, and although this work cannot in any way
aim at presenting another system as an alternative to Herr Dühring's
“system”, yet it is to be hoped that the reader will not fail to
observe the connection inherent in the various views which I have advanced. I
have already had proof enough that in this respect my work has not been
entirely fruitless.</p>
<a id="005"></a>
<p>On the other hand, the “system-creating” Herr Dühring is by no
means an isolated phenomenon in contemporary Germany. For some time now in
Germany systems of cosmogony, of philosophy of nature in general, of politics,
of economics, etc., have been springing up by the dozen overnight, like
mushrooms. The most insignificant <i>doctor philosophiae</i> and even a
student will not go in for anything less than a complete “system”.
Just as in the modern state it is presumed that every citizen is competent to
pass judgment on all the issues on which he is called to vote; and just as in
economics it is assumed that every consumer is a connoisseur of all the
commodities which he has occasion to buy for his maintenance — so similar
assumptions are now to be made in science. Freedom of science is taken to mean
that people write on every subject which they have not studied, and put this
forward as the only strictly scientific method. Herr Dühring, however, is one
of the most characteristic types of this bumptious pseudo-science which in
Germany nowadays is forcing its way to the front everywhere and is drowning
everything with its resounding — sublime nonsense. Sublime nonsense in
poetry, in philosophy, in politics, in economics, in historiography, sublime
nonsense in the lecture room and on the platform, sublime nonsense everywhere;
sublime nonsense which lays claim to a superiority and depth of thought
distinguishing it from the simple, commonplace nonsense of other nations;
sublime nonsense, the most characteristic mass product of Germany's
intellectual industry — cheap but bad — just like other German-made
goods, only that unfortunately it was not exhibited along with them at
Philadelphia. <a href="footnotes.html#n6" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[6]</sup></a> Even
German socialism has lately, particularly since Herr Dühring's good example,
gone in for a considerable amount of sublime nonsense, producing various
persons who give themselves airs about “science”, of which they
“really never learnt a word”. <a href="footnotes.html#n7" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[7]</sup></a> This is an infantile disease which marks, and is
inseparable from, the incipient conversion of the German student to Social
Democracy, but which our workers with their remarkably healthy nature will
undoubtedly overcome.</p>
<a id="006"></a>
<p>It was not my fault that I had to follow Herr Dühring into realms where at
best I can only claim to be a dilettante. In such cases I have for the most
part limited myself to putting forward the correct, undisputed facts in
opposition to my adversary's false or distorted assertions. This applies to
jurisprudence and in some instances also to natural science. In other cases it
has been a question of general views connected with the theory of natural
science — that is, a field where even the professional natural scientist
is compelled to pass beyond his own speciality and encroach on neighbouring
territory — territory on which he is therefore, as Herr Virchow has
admitted, just as much a semi-initiate" as any one of us. I hope that in
respect of minor inexactitudes and clumsiness of expression, I shall be granted
the same indulgence as is shown to another in this domain.</p>
<a id="007"></a>
<p>Just as I was completing this preface I received a publishers' notice,
composed by Herr Dühring, of a new “authoritative” work of Herr
Dühring's: <i>Neue Grundgesetze zur rationellen Physik und Chemie.</i>
Conscious as I am of the inadequacy of my knowledge of physics and chemistry, I
nevertheless believe that I know my Herr Dühring, and therefore, without having
seen the work itself, think that I am entitled to say in advance that the laws
of physics and chemistry put forward in it will be worthy to take their place,
by their erroneousness or platitudinousness, among the laws of economics, world
schematism, etc., which were discovered earlier by Herr Dühring and are
examined in this book of mine; and also that the rhigometer, or instrument
constructed by Herr Dühring for measuring extremely low temperatures, will
serve as a measure not of temperatures either high or low, but simply and
solely of the ignorant arrogance of Herr Dühring.</p>

<h1>II — 1885 Preface</h1>
<p class="fst">I had not expected that a new edition of this book would have to
be published. The subject matter of its criticism is now practically forgotten;
the work itself was not only available to many thousands of readers in the form
of a series of articles published in the Leipzig <i>Vorwärts</i> in 1877 and
1878, but also appeared in its entirety as a separate book, of which a large
edition was printed. How then can anyone still be interested in what I had to
say about Herr Dühring years ago?</p>
<a id="010"></a>
<p>I think that I owe this in the first place to the fact that this book, as in
general almost all my works that were still current at the time, was prohibited
within the German Empire immediately after the Anti-Socialist Law <a href="footnotes.html#n8" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[8]</sup></a> was promulgated. To
anyone whose brain has not been ossified by the hereditary bureaucratic
prejudices of the countries of the Holy Alliance, <a href="footnotes.html#n9" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[9]</sup></a> the effect of this
measure must have been self-evident: a doubled and trebled sale of the
prohibited books, and the exposure of the impotence of the gentlemen in Berlin
who issue prohibitions and are unable to enforce them. Indeed the kindness of
the Imperial Government has brought me more new editions of my minor works than
I could really cope with; I have had no time to make a proper revision of the
text, and in most cases have been obliged simply to allow it to be reprinted as
it stood.</p>
<a id="011"></a>
<p>But there was also another factor. The “system” of Herr Dühring
which is criticised in this book ranges over a very wide theoretical domain;
and I was compelled to follow him wherever he went and to oppose my conceptions
to his. As a result, my negative criticism became positive, the polemic was
transformed into a more or less connected exposition of the dialectical method
and of the communist world outlook championed by Marx and myself — an
exposition covering a fairly comprehensive range of subjects. After its first
presentation to the world in Marx’s <i>Misére de la philosophie</i> and
in the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>, this mode of outlook of ours, having
passed through an incubation period of fully twenty years before the
publication of <i>Capital</i>, has been more and more rapidly extending its
influence among ever widening circles, and now finds recognition and support
far beyond the boundaries of Europe, in every country which contains on the one
hand proletarians and on the other undaunted scientific theoreticians. It seems
therefore that there is a public whose interest in the subject is great enough
for them to take into the bargain the polemic against the Dühring tenets merely
for the sake of the positive conceptions developed alongside this polemic, in
spite of the fact that the latter has now largely lost its point.</p>
<a id="012"></a>
<p>I must note in passing that inasmuch as the mode of outlook expounded in
this book was founded and developed in far greater measure by Marx, and only to
an insignificant degree by myself, it was self-understood between us that this
exposition of mine should not be issued without his knowledge. I read the whole
manuscript to him before it was printed, and the tenth chapter of the part on
economics (“From <i>Kritische Geschichte</i>”) was written by
Marx <a href="footnotes.html#n10" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[10]</sup></a> but
unfortunately had to be shortened somewhat by me for purely external reasons.
As a matter of fact, we had always been accustomed to help each other out in
special subjects.</p>
<a id="013"></a>
<p>With the exception of one chapter, the present new edition is an unaltered
reprint of the former edition. For one thing, I had no time for a thoroughgoing
revision, although there was much in the presentation that I should have liked
to alter. Besides I am under the obligation to prepare for the press the
manuscripts which Marx has left, and this is much more important than anything
else. Then again, my conscience rebels against making any alterations. The book
is a polemic, and I think that I owe it to my adversary not to improve anything
in my work when he is unable to improve his. I could only claim the right to
make a rejoinder to Herr Dühring's reply. But I have not read, and will not
read, unless there is some special reason to do so, what Herr Dühring has
written concerning my attack <a href="footnotes.html#n11" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[11]</sup></a>; in point of theory I have :finished with him.
Besides, I must observe the rules of decency in literary warfare all the more
strictly in his regard because of the despicable injustice that has since been
done to him by the University of Berlin. It is true that the University has not
gone unpunished. A university which so abases itself as to deprive Herr
Dühring, in circumstances which are well known, of his academic freedom <a href="footnotes.html#n12" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[12]</sup></a> must not be
surprised to find Herr Schweninger forced on it in circumstances which are
equally well known.</p>
<a id="014"></a>
<p>The only chapter in which I have allowed myself some additional elucidation
is the second of Part III, "Theoretical". This chapter deals simply and solely
with the exposition of a pivotal point in the mode of outlook for which I
stand, and my adversary cannot therefore complain if I attempt to state it in a
more popular form and to make it more coherent. And there was in fact an
extraneous reason for doing this. I had revised three chapters of the book (the
first chapter of the Introduction and the first and second of Part III) for my
friend Lafargue with a view to their translation into French <a href="footnotes.html#n13" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[13]</sup></a> and publication as a
separate pamphlet and after the French edition had served as the basis for
Italian and Polish editions, a German edition was issued by me under the title:
<i>Die Entwicklung des Sozialismus von der Utopie zur Wissenschaft.</i> This
ran through three editions within a few months, and also appeared in Russian <a href="footnotes.html#n14" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[14]</sup></a> and Danish
translations. In all these editions it was only the chapter in question which
had been amplified, and it would have been pedantic, in the new edition of the
original work, to have tied myself down to its original text instead of the
later text which had become known internationally.</p>
<a id="015"></a>
<p>Whatever else I should have liked to alter relates in the main to two
points. First, to the history of primitive society, the key to which was
provided by Morgan only in 1877. But as I have since then had the opportunity,
in my work: <i>Der Ursprung der Familie</i>, <i>des Privateigenthums und des
Staats</i> (Zurich, 1884) to work up the material which in the meantime had
become available to me, a reference to this later work meets the case. The
second point concerns the section dealing with theoretical natural science.
There is much that is clumsy in my exposition and much of it could be expressed
today in a clearer and more definite form. I have not allowed myself the right
to improve this section, and for that very reason am under an obligation to
criticise myself here instead.</p>
<a id="016"></a>
<p>Marx and I were pretty well the only people to rescue conscious dialectics
from German idealist philosophy and apply it in the materialist conception of
nature and history. But a knowledge of mathematics and natural science is
essential to a conception of nature which is dialectical and at the same time
materialist. Marx was well versed in mathematics, but we could keep up with
natural science only piecemeal, intermittently and sporadically. For this
reason, when I retired from business and transferred my home to London, <a href="footnotes.html#n15" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[15]</sup></a> thus enabling myself
to give the necessary time to it, I went through as complete as possible a
“moulting”, as Liebig calls it, <a href="footnotes.html#n16" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[16]</sup></a> in mathematics and the natural sciences, and spent
the best part of eight years on it. I was right in the middle of this
“moulting” process when it happened that I had to occupy myself
with Herr Dühring's so-called natural philosophy. It was therefore only too
natural that in dealing with this subject I was sometimes unable to find the
correct technical expression, and in general moved with considerable clumsiness
in the field of theoretical natural science. On the other hand, my lack of
assurance in this field, which I had not yet overcome, made me cautious, and I
cannot be charged with real blunders in relation to the facts known at that
time or with incorrect presentation of recognised theories. In this connection
there was only one unrecognised genius of a mathematician a who complained in a
letter to Marx <a href="footnotes.html#n17" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[17]</sup></a>
that I had made a wanton attack upon the honour of  <img alt="the square root of minus one" hspace="1" src="ad01.gif"/>.</p>
<a id="017"></a>
<p>It goes without saying that my recapitulation of mathematics and the natural
sciences was undertaken in order to convince myself also in detail — of
what in general I was not in doubt — that in nature, amid the welter of
innumerable changes, the same dialectical laws of motion force their way
through as those which in history govern the apparent fortuitousness of events;
the same laws which similarly form the thread running through the history of
the development of human thought and gradually rise to consciousness in
thinking man; the laws which Hegel first developed in all-embracing but mystic
form, and which we made it one of our aims to strip of this mystic form and to
bring clearly before the mind in their complete simplicity and universality. It
goes without saying that the old philosophy of nature — in spite of its
real value and the many fruitful seeds it contained <a href="notes.html#n*1" target=_blank><sup class="enote">*1</sup></a> — was unable to
satisfy us. As is more fully brought out in this book, natural philosophy,
particularly in the Hegelian form, erred because it did not concede to nature
any development in time, any “succession”, but only
“co-existence”. This was on the one hand grounded in the Hegelian
system itself, which ascribed historical evolution only to the
“spirit”, but on the other hand was also due to the whole state of
the natural sciences in that period. In this Hegel fell far behind Kant, whose
nebular theory had already indicated the origin of the solar system, and whose
discovery of the retardation of the earth's rotation by the tides also had
proclaimed the doom of that system. And finally, to me there could be no
question of building the laws of dialectics into nature, but of discovering
them in it and evolving them from it.</p>
<a id="018"></a>
<p>But to do this systematically and in each separate department, is a gigantic
task. Not only is the domain to be mastered almost boundless; natural science
in this entire domain is itself undergoing such a mighty process of being
revolutionised that even people who can devote the whole of their spare time to
it can hardly keep pace. Since Karl Marx’s death, however, my time has
been requisitioned for more urgent duties, and I have therefore been compelled
to lay aside my work. For the present I must content myself with the
indications given in this book, and must wait to find some later opportunity to
put together and publish the results which I have arrived at, perhaps in
conjunction with the extremely important mathematical manuscripts left by Marx.
<a href="footnotes.html#n18" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[18]</sup></a></p>
<a id="019"></a>
<p>Yet the advance of theoretical natural science may possibly make my work to
a great extent or even altogether superfluous. For the revolution which is
being forced on theoretical natural science by the mere need to set in order
the purely empirical discoveries great masses of which have been piled up, is
of such a kind that it must bring the dialectical character of natural
processes more and more to the consciousness even of those empiricists who are
most opposed to it. The old rigid antagonisms, the sharp, impassable dividing
lines are more and more disappearing. Since even the last “true” gases have
been liquefied, and since it has been proved that a body can be brought into a
condition in which the liquid and the gaseous forms are indistinguishable, the
aggregate states have lost the last relics of their former absolute character.
<a href="footnotes.html#n19" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[19]</sup></a> With the thesis of the kinetic theory of
gases, that in perfect gases at equal temperatures the squares of the speeds
with which the individual gas molecules move are in inverse ratio to their
molecular weights heat also takes its place directly among the forms of motion
which can be immediately measured as such. Whereas only ten years ago the great
basic law of motion, then recently discovered, was as yet conceived merely as a
law of the <i>conservation</i> of energy, as the mere expression of the
indestructibility and uncreatability of motion, that is, merely in its
quantitative aspect, this narrow negative conception is being more and more
supplanted by the positive idea of the <i>transformation</i> of energy, in
which for the first time the qualitative content of the process comes into its
own, and the last vestige of an extramundane creator is obliterated. That the
quantity of motion (so-called energy) remains unaltered when it is transformed
from kinetic energy (so-called mechanical force) into electricity, heat,
potential energy, etc., and vice versa, no longer needs to be preached as
something new; it serves as the already secured basis for the now much more
pregnant investigation into the very process of transformation, the great basic
process, knowledge of which comprises all knowledge of nature. And since
biology has been pursued in the light of the theory of evolution, one rigid
boundary line of classification after another has been swept away in the domain
of organic nature. The almost unclassifiable intermediate links are growing
daily more numerous, closer investigation throws organisms out of one class
into another, and distinguishing characteristics which almost became articles
of faith are losing their absolute validity; we now have mammals that lay eggs,
and, if the report is confirmed, also birds that walk on all fours. Years ago
Virchow was compelled, following on the discovery of the cell, to dissolve the
unity of the individual animal being into a federation of cell-states —
thus acting more progressively rather than scientifically and dialectically <a href="footnotes.html#n20" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[20]</sup></a> — and now the conception of animal
(therefore also human) individuality is becoming far more complex owing to the
discovery of the white blood corpuscles which creep about amoeba-like within
the bodies of the higher animals. It is however precisely the polar antagonisms
put forward as irreconcilable and insoluble, the forcibly fixed lines of
demarcation and class distinctions, which have given modern theoretical natural
science its restricted, metaphysical character. The recognition that these
antagonisms and distinctions, though to be found in nature, are only of
relative validity, and that on the other hand their imagined rigidity and
absolute validity have been introduced into nature only by our reflective minds
— this recognition is the kernel of the dialectical conception of nature.
It is possible to arrive at this recognition because the accumulating facts of
natural science compel us to do so; but one arrives at it more easily if one
approaches the dialectical character of these facts equipped with an
understanding of the laws of dialectical thought. In any case natural science
has now advanced so far that it can no longer escape dialectical
generalisation. However it will make this process easier for itself if it does
not lose sight of the fact that the results in which its experiences are
summarised are concepts, that the art of working with concepts is not inborn
and also is not given with ordinary everyday consciousness, but requires real
thought, and that this thought similarly has a long empirical history, not more
and not less than empirical natural science. Only by learning to assimilate the
results of the development of philosophy during the past two and a half
thousand years will it rid itself on the one hand of any natural philosophy
standing apart from it, outside it and above it, and on the other hand also of
its own limited method of thought, which is its inheritance from English
empiricism.</p>

<h1>III — 1894 Preface</h1>
<p class="fst">The following new edition is a reprint of the former, except for
a few very unimportant stylistic changes. It is only in one chapter — the
tenth of Part II: "From <i>Kritische Geschichte</i>" that I have allowed
myself to make substantial additions, on the following grounds.</p>
<a id="022"></a>
<p>As already stated in the preface to the second edition, this chapter was in
all essentials the work of Marx. I was forced to make considerable cuts in
Marx's manuscript, which in its first wording had been intended as an article
for a journal; and I had to cut precisely those parts of it in which the
critique of Dühring's propositions was overshadowed by Marx's own revelations
from the history of economics. But this is just the section of the manuscript
which is even today of the greatest and most permanent interest. I consider
myself under an obligation to give in as full and faithful a form as possible
the passages in which Marx assigns to people like Petty, North, Locke and Hume
their appropriate place in the genesis of classical political economy; and even
more his explanation of Quesnay's economic <i>Tableau</i>, which has remained
an insoluble riddle of the sphinx to all modern political economy. On the other
hand, wherever the thread of the argument makes this possible, I have omitted
passages which refer exclusively to Herr Dühring's writings.</p>
<a id="023"></a>
<p>For the rest I may well be perfectly satisfied with the degree to which,
since the previous edition of this book was issued, the views maintained in it
have penetrated into the social consciousness of scientific circles and of the
working class in every civilised country of the world.</p>

<p class="title">Anti-Dühring by Frederick Engels 1877<br>
Part II: Political Economy</p>
<a id="c9"></a>
<h1>IX. Natural Laws of the Economy.<br>
Rent of Land</h1>
<p class="fst">Up to this point we have been unable, despite our sincerest
efforts, to discover how Herr Dühring, in the domain of economics, can <a id="207"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“come forward with the claim to a new <i>system</i> which
is not merely adequate for the epoch but <i>authoritative for the epoch”</i>
{D. K. G. 1}. <a id="208"></a></p>
<p class="fst">However, what we have not been able to discern in his theory of
force and his doctrine of value and of capital, may perhaps become as clear as
daylight to us when we consider the “natural laws of national economy” {D. C.
4} put forward by Herr Dühring. For, as he puts it with his usual originality
and in his trenchant way, <a id="209"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“the triumph of the higher scientific method consists in
passing beyond the mere description and classification of apparently static
matter and attaining living intuitions which illumine the genesis of things.
Knowledge of laws is therefore the most perfect knowledge, for it shows us how
one process is conditioned by another” {59}. <a id="210"></a></p>
<p class="fst">The very first natural law of any economy has been specially
discovered by Herr Dühring. <a id="211"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">Adam Smith, “curiously enough, not only did not bring out the
leading part played by the most important factor in all economic development,
but even completely failed to give it distinctive formulation, and thus
unintentionally reduced to a subordinate role the power which placed its stamp
on the development of modern Europe” {64}. This “fundamental law, to which the
leading role must be assigned, is that of the technical equipment, one might
even say armament, of the natural economic energy of man” {63}. <a id="212"></a></p>
<p class="fst">This “fundamental law” {66} discovered by Herr Dühring reads as
follows: <a id="213"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">Law No. 1. “The productivity of the economic instruments,
natural resources and human energy is increased by <i>inventions</i> and
<i>discoveries</i>” {65}. <a id="214"></a></p>
<p class="fst">We are overcome with astonishment. Herr Dühring treats us as
Molière's newly baked nobleman is treated by the wag who announces to him the
news that all through his life he has been speaking prose without knowing it.
That in a good many cases the productive power of labour is increased by
inventions and discoveries (but also that in very many cases it is not
increased, as is proved by the mass of waste-paper in the archives of every
patent office in the world) we knew long ago; but we owe to Herr Dühring the
enlightening information that this banality, which is as old as the hills, is
the fundamental law of all economics. If “the triumph of the higher scientific
method” in economics, as in philosophy, consists only in giving a high-sounding
name to the first commonplace that comes to one’s mind, and trumpeting it forth
as a natural law or even a fundamental law, then it becomes possible for
anybody, even the editors of the Berlin <i>Volks-Zeitung</i>, to lay “deeper
foundations” {11} and to revolutionise science. We should then “in all rigour”
{9, 95} be forced to apply to Herr Dühring himself Herr Dühring's judgment on
Plato: <a id="215"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“If however that is supposed to be political-economic wisdom,
then the author of” the critical foundations “shares it with every person who
ever had occasion to conceive an idea“ or even only to babble “about anything
that was obvious on the face of it” {D. K. G. 20}. <a id="216"></a></p>
<p class="fst">If, for example, we say animals eat, we are saying quite calmly,
in our innocence, something of great import; for we only have to say that
eating is the fundamental law of all animal life, and we have revolutionised
the whole of zoology. <a id="217"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">Law No. 2. Division of Labour: “The cleaving of trades and
the dissection of activities raises the productivity of labour” {D. C. 73}. <a id="218"></a></p>
<p class="fst">In so far as this is true, it also has been a commonplace since
Adam Smith. <i>How</i> far it is true will be shown in Part III. <a id="219"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">Law No. 3. <i>“Distance and transport</i> are the chief
causes which hinder or facilitate the co-operation of the productive forces”
{91}. <a id="220"></a></p>
<p>Law No. 4. “The industrial state has an incomparably greater population
capacity than the agricultural state” {107}. <a id="221"></a></p>
<p>Law No. 5. “In the economy nothing takes place without a material interest”
{126}. <a id="222"></a></p>
<p class="fst">These are the “natural laws” {4, 5} on which Herr Dühring founds
his new economics. He remains faithful to his method, already demonstrated in
the section on Philosophy. In economics too a few self-evident statements of
the utmost banality—moreover quite often very ineptly expressed —
form the axioms which need no proof, the fundamental theorems, the natural
laws. Under the pretext of developing the content of these laws, which have no
content, he seizes the opportunity to pour out a wordy stream of economic
twaddle on the various themes whose <i>names</i> occur in these pretended
laws—inventions, division of labour, means of transport, population,
interests, competition, and so forth—a verbal outpouring whose flat
commonplaces are seasoned only with oracular grandiloquence, and here and there
with inept formulations or pretentious hair-splitting over all kinds of
casuistical subtleties. Then finally we reach rent of land, earnings of
capital, and wages, and as we have dealt with only the two latter forms of
appropriation in the preceding exposition, we propose now in conclusion to make
a brief examination of the Dühringian conception of rent. <a id="223"></a></p>
<p>In doing this we shall not consider those points which Herr Dühring has
merely copied from his predecessor Carey; we are not concerned with Carey, nor
with defending Ricardo's views on rent of land against Carey’s distortions and
stupidities. We are only concerned with Herr Dühring, and he defines rent as <a id="224"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“that income which the proprietor <i>as such</i> draws from
the land” {D. C. 156}. <a id="225"></a></p>
<p class="fst">The economic concept of rent of land, which is what Herr Dühring
is to explain, is straightaway transferred by him into the juridical sphere, so
that we are no wiser than we were before. Our constructor of deeper foundations
must therefore, whether he likes it or not, condescend to give some further
explanation. He compares the lease of a farm to a tenant with the loan of
capital to an entrepreneur, but soon finds that there is a hitch in the
comparison, like in many others. <a id="226"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">For, he says, “if one wanted to press the analogy further,
the earnings left to the tenant after payment of rent must correspond to the
balance of earnings of capital left with the entrepreneur who puts the capital
to use after he has paid interest. <i>But it is not customary</i> to regard
tenants' earnings as the main income and rent as a balance... A proof of this
difference of conception is the <i>fact</i> that in the theory of land rent
the case of management of land by the owner is not separately treated, and no
special emphasis is laid on the difference between the amount of rent in the
case of a lease and where the owner produces the rent himself. <i>At any rate
no one has found it necessary</i> to conceive the rent resulting from such
self-management of land as divided in such a way that one portion represents as
it were the interest on the landed property and the other portion the surplus
earnings of enterprise. Apart from the tenant’s own capital which he brings
into the business, it would <i>seem</i> that his specific <i>earnings are
mostly regarded</i> as a kind of wages. It is however <i>hazardous</i> to
assert anything on this subject, as the question has never been raised in this
definite form. Wherever we are dealing with fairly large farms it can easily be
seen that it will not do to treat what are specifically the farmer’s earnings
as wages. For these earnings are themselves based on the antithesis existing in
relation to the rural labour-power, through whose exploitation that form of
income is alone made possible. It is clearly <i>a part of the rent</i> which
remains in the hands of the tenant and by which the <i>full rent</i>, which
the owner managing himself would obtain, is reduced” {157-58}. <a id="227"></a></p>
<p class="fst">The theory of land rent is a part of political economy which is
specifically English, and necessarily so, because it was only in England that
there existed a mode of production under which rent had in fact been separated
from profit and interest. In England, as is well known, large landed estates
and large-scale agriculture predominate. The landlords lease their land in
large, often very large, farms, to tenant-farmers who possess sufficient
capital to work them and, unlike our peasants, do not work themselves but
employ the labour of hands and day-labourers on the lines of full-fledged
capitalist entrepreneurs. Here, therefore, we have the three classes of
bourgeois society and the form of income peculiar to each: the landlord,
drawing rent of land; the capitalist, drawing profit; and the labourer, drawing
wages. It has never occurred to any English economist to regard the farmer’s
earnings as a kind of wages, as <i>seems</i> to Herr Dühring to be the case;
even less could it be <i>hazardous</i> for such an economist to assert that
the farmer’s profit is what it indisputably, obviously and tangibly is, namely,
profit on capital. It is perfectly ridiculous to say that the question of what
the farmer’s earnings actually are has never been raised in this definite form.
In England there has never been any necessity even to raise this question; both
question and answer have long been available, derived from the facts
themselves, and since Adam Smith there has never been any doubt about them. <a id="228"></a></p>
<p>The case of self-management, as Herr Dühring calls it — or rather, the
management of farms by bailiffs for the landowner’s account, as happens most
frequently in Germany—does not alter the matter. If the landowner also
provides the capital and has the farm run for his own account, he pockets the
profit on capital in addition to the rent, as is self-understood and cannot be
otherwise on the basis of the existing mode of production. And if Herr Dühring
asserts that up to now no one has found it necessary to conceive the rent (he
should say revenue) resulting from the owner's own management as divided into
parts, this is simply untrue, and at best only proves his own ignorance once
again. For example: <a id="229"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“The revenue derived from labour is called wages. That
derived from stock, by the person who manages or employs it, is called
profit... The revenue which proceeds altogether from land, is called rent, and
belongs to the landlord... When those three different sorts of revenue belong
to different persons they are readily distinguished; but when they belong to
the same they are sometimes confounded with one another, at least in common
language. A gentleman <i>who farms</i> a part of his own estate, after paying
the expense of cultivation, should <i>gain both the rent of the landlord and
the profit of the farmer.</i> He is apt to denominate, however, his whole
gain, profit, and thus confounds rent with profit, at least in common language.
The greater part of our North American and West Indian planters are in this
situation. They farm, the greater part of them, their own estates, and
accordingly we seldom hear of the rent of a plantation, but frequently of its
profit... A gardener who cultivates his own garden with his own hands, unites
in his own person the three different characters, of landlord, farmer, and
labourer. His produce, therefore, should pay him the rent of the first, the
profit of the second, and the wages of the third. The whole, however, is
commonly considered as the earnings of his labour. Both rent and profit are, in
this case, confounded with wages." <a id="230"></a></p>
<p class="fst">This passage is from the sixth chapter of Book I of <i>Adam
Smith</i>. The case of self-management was therefore investigated a hundred
years ago, and the doubts and uncertainties which so worry Herr Dühring in this
connection are merely due to his own ignorance. <a id="231"></a></p>
<p>He eventually escapes from his quandary by an audacious trick: <a id="232"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">The farmer's earnings come from the exploitation of the
“rural labour-power” and are therefore obviously a “part of the rent” by which
the “full rent”, which really should flow into the landowner’s pocket, “is
reduced”. <a id="233"></a></p>
<p class="fst">From this we learn two things. Firstly, that the farmer
“reduces” the rent of the landowner, so that, according to Herr Dühring, it is
not, as was considered hitherto, the farmer who pays rent to the landowner, but
the <i>landowner</i> who <i>pays rent to the farmer</i>—certainly a
“from the ground up original view” {D. Ph. 525}. And secondly, we learn at last
what Herr Dühring thinks rent of land is: namely, the whole surplus-product
obtained in farming by the exploitation of rural labour. But as this
surplus-product in all economics hitherto—save perhaps for the work of a
few vulgar economists—has been divided into land rent and profit on
capital, we are compelled to note that Herr Dühring's view of rent also is “not
the accepted one” {D. K. G. 497}. <a id="234"></a></p>
<p>According to Herr Dühring, therefore, the only difference between rent of
land and earnings of capital is that the former is obtained in agriculture and
the latter in industry or commerce. And it was of necessity that Herr Dühring
arrived at such an uncritical and confused view of the matter. We saw that his
starting-point was the “really historical conception”, that domination over the
land could be based only on domination over man. As soon, therefore, as land is
cultivated by means of any form of subjugated labour, a surplus for the
landlord arises, and this surplus is the rent, just as in industry the
surplus-labour product beyond what the labourer earns is the profit on capital.
<a id="235"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“Thus it is clear that land rent exists on a considerable
scale wherever and whenever agriculture is carried on by means of any of the
forms of subjugation of labour” {D. C. 162}. <a id="236"></a></p>
<p class="fst">In this presentation of rent as the whole surplus-product
obtained in agriculture, Herr Dühring comes up against both English farmer’s
profit and the division, based on English farming and recognised by all
classical political economy, of that surplus-product into rent of land and
farmer’s profit, and hence against the <i>pure</i>, precise conception of
rent. What does Herr Dühring do? He pretends not to have the slightest inkling
of the division of the surplus-product of agriculture into farmer’s profit and
rent, and therefore of the whole rent theory of classical political economy; he
pretends that the question of what farmer’s profit really is has never yet been
raised “in this definite form” {157}, that at issue is a subject which has
never yet been investigated and about which there is no knowledge but only
illusion and uncertainty. And he flees from fatal England—where, without
the intervention of any theoretical school, the surplus-product of agriculture
is so remorselessly divided into its elements: rent of land and profit on
capital—to the country so beloved by him, where the Prussian law
exercises dominion, where self-management is in full patriarchal bloom, where
“the landlord understands by rent the income from his plots of land” and the
Junkers’ views on rent still claim to be authoritative for science—where
therefore Herr Dühring can still hope to slip through with his confused ideas
of rent and profit and even to find credence for his latest discovery: that
rent of land is paid not by the farmer to the landlord but by the landlord to
the farmer. <a id="237"></a></p>

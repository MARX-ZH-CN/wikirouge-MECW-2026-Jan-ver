<h4>August 14, 1879</h4>
<p class="fst">Since my arrival here I have not looked at any newspapers and have, in fact, read nothing apart from the first volume of Carleton’s <i>Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry. </i>It was labour enough to get through the first volume and I shall put the second aside until a better time. The work consists of unconnected tales, in which Irish peasant life is illustrated now from this side and now from that; so the book is not the sort one can swallow at one gulp. For this very reason it is a book which one must buy and possess in order <i>au fur et à mesure</i> <span class="context">[according to need]</span> to regale oneself now with this dish, now with another. Carleton is neither a good stylist nor a master of composition; his originality lies in the truth of his descriptions. As the son of an Irish peasant he knows his subject better than the Levers and Lovers.</p>

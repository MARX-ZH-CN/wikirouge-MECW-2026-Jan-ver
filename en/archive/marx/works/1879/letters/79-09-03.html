<h4>Ramsgate, 3 September 1879<br>
62 Plains of Waterloo</h4>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Meyer (R.) wrote <span class="context">[on 29 August 1879]</span> and announced his intention of visiting me, while at the same time saying, on the other hand, that I was to let him know, i.e. telegraph him, ‘<strong>Do not come’,</strong> should I be otherwise engaged. <strong>Firstly</strong>, therefore, I telegraphed him in the ‘negative’, secondly, however, proceeded to write him a letter *to this effect, that in consequence of Mrs Marx’s bad health my whole time is taken up ‘presently'*. I am telling you this in order that you may know how things stand, should he raise the matter with you. In fact my wife is <strong>improving</strong> only very slowly and hence <strong>by no means anxious to see Meyer here</strong>.</p>
<p>Jennychen had her first outing today, a fifteen minute walk; <strong>She progresses favourably</strong>. </p>
<p class="fst">Your<br>
Moor</p>
<p>How is jolly getting on? </p>

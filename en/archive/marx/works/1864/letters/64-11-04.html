<h4> [London,] 4 November 1864</h4>
<p>Dear <strong>Frederick</strong>,</p>
<p>I was very pleased to hear from you again. </p>
<p>All well here. Myself included, since your departure from here until the day before yesterday, when yet another carbuncle appeared below my right breast. If the thing does not clear up quickly and others appear, I intend to use Gumpert’s arsenic remedy this time.</p>
<p>I would translate your runic <i>rm hart, </i>etc. as Dutch-Frisian for open heart, clear horizon. But I fear that there may be a quite different explanation, so I give up the riddle.</p>
<p>You must send all the <i>enclosed papers </i>back to me as soon as read. <i>I still need them. </i>So that I do not forget any of the things I wanted to tell you, I am going to number them.</p>
<p>1.<i> Lassalle and Countess Hatzfeldt.</i></p>
<p>The lengthy document is a copy of a circular that Herwegh’s wife (<i>honi soit qui mal y pense</i>), <i>Emma, </i>sent to Berlin immediately after the catastrophe, so that <strong>extracts </strong>from it could be put in the newspapers. You will see from it how cleverly Emma manages to put herself and her spineless Georg in the limelight at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of the report; how the account evades two important points, <i>firstly </i>Rstow’s meeting with Donniges and daughter, when the latter must have <i>renounced </i>Lassalle before the scene recounted by Emma took place. <i>Secondly: </i>how the duel came about. Lassalle wrote the insulting letter. But then something happened which is <i>not </i>reported and which led directly to the duel.</p>
<p>The suppression of two such important and crucial points makes one sceptical of the accuracy of the account.</p>
<p><i>The Hatzfeldt letter. </i>On her arrival in Berlin I got Liebknecht to take her a brief letter of condolence from myself. Liebknecht wrote to me that she was complaining ‘I left Lassalle in the lurch’, as if I could have done the man any greater service than by keeping my mouth shut and letting him do as he liked. (In his last speech before the Dsseldorf assizes, he played the part of Marquis Posa with handsome William as Philipp II, whom he was trying to persuade to suspend the present constitution, proclaim universal direct suffrage and ally himself with the proletariat.) You can see what is behind her letter and what she wants of me. I wrote a very amicable but diplomatically discouraging letter in reply. The latterday Redeemer! That personage and the sycophants, who surround her, are mad.</p>
<p>Apropos. A couple of <strong>numbers</strong> of E. Jones’ <i>Notes to the People </i>(1851, 1852) happened to fall into my hands again; as far as the economic articles are concerned, the main points in them had been written directly under my guidance and partly even in direct collaboration with myself. <strong>Well!</strong> What do I find in them? That at that time we conducted the same polemic — only better — against the co-operative movement, since it claimed, in its present narrow-minded form, to be the <i>last word, </i>as Lassalle conducted against Schulze-Delitzsch in Germany 10-12 years later.</p>
<p>In his last will and testament Lassalle has ‘installed’ Bernhard Becker, the unfortunate fellow, who was Juch’s editor on the <i>Hermann </i>for a while, as his successor in the office of President of the General Association of German Workers — in his ‘last will and testament’ (like a ruling prince). The Association’s congress meets in Dsseldorf this month, 16 and strong opposition to this ‘decree’ by last will and testament is expected.</p>
<p>Also enclosed, letter from a worker in Solingen, Klings, in fact the clandestine leader of the Rhineland workers (former member of the League'). This <i>letter is not to be returned but filed.</i></p>
<p>2. <strong>Workingmen’s International Association</strong></p>
<p>Some time ago, London workers sent an address to workers in Paris about Poland and called upon them to act jointly in the matter.</p>
<p>For their part, the Parisians sent over a deputation headed by a worker named <i>Tolain, </i>who was the <i>real workers’ candidate in the last elections in Paris, </i>a thoroughly nice fellow. (His <i>compagnons </i>were quite nice lads, too.) A <strong>public meeting</strong> in St Martin’s Hall was called, for 28 September 1864, by Odger (shoemaker, President of the local <strong>Council of All London Trades’ Unions</strong> and, in particular, also of the <strong>Trades’ Unions Suffrage Agitation Society</strong>, is which is connected with Bright) and Cremer, a <strong>mason</strong> and secretary of the <strong>Mason’s Union</strong>. (These two had arranged the big <strong>Trade-Union meeting</strong> on North America chaired by Bright in St James’s Hall, ditto the Garibaldi manifestations.) A certain <i>Le Lubez </i>was sent to ask me if I would participate <i>pour les ouvriers allemands</i> <span class="context">[for the German workers]</span><i>, </i>and, in particular, whether I was willing to provide a German worker to speak at the <strong>meeting</strong>, etc. I provided them with Eccarius, who put on a splendid performance, and I was also present myself in a non-speaking capacity on the <strong>platform</strong>. I knew that on this occasion ‘people who really count’ were appearing, both from London and from Paris, and I therefore decided to waive my usual standing rule to <strong>decline any such invitations</strong>.</p>
<p>(<i>Le Lubez is </i>a young Frenchman, i.e. in his thirties; however, he grew up in jersey and London, speaks capital English and is a very good intermediary between the French and English workers.) (Music teacher and <i>leons</i> of <strong>French</strong>.)</p>
<p>At the <strong>meeting</strong>, which was <i>chock-full </i>(for <strong>there is now evidently a revival of the working-classes taking place</strong>), Major Wolff (Thurn-Taxis, Garibaldi’s adjutant) represented <strong>the London Italian Workingmen’s Society</strong>. It was resolved to found a ‘<strong>Workingmen’s International Association’,</strong> whose <strong>general Council</strong> is to have its seat in London and is to ‘Intermediate’ between the workers’ <strong>Societies</strong> in Germany, Italy, France, and England. Ditto that a General <strong>Workingmen’s Congress</strong> was to be convened in Belgium in 1865. A <strong>Provisional Committee</strong> was set up at the <strong>meeting</strong>, with Odger, Cremer and many others, some of them former Chartists, former Owenites, etc., representing England, Major Wolff, Fontana, and other Italians representing Italy, Le Lubez, etc. for France, Eccarius and myself for Germany. The <strong>committee</strong> was empowered to co-opt as many people as it chose.</p>
<p><strong>So far so good</strong>. I attended the first meeting of the committee. A <i>Sub-Committee </i>(including myself) was set up to draft a <i>declaration des principes </i>and provisional rules. Indisposition prevented me from attending the meeting of the Sub-Committee and the subsequent meeting of the full committee.</p>
<p>At these two meetings, which I did not attend, — that of the Sub-Committee and the subsequent one of the full committee — the following occurred:</p>
<p>Major <i>Wolff</i> had submitted the regulations (statutes) of the <i>Italian Workers’ Associations </i>(which possess a central organisation, but, as emerged later, are essentially associated <strong>Benefit Societies</strong>) to be used by the new Association. I saw the stuff later. It was <strong>evidently</strong> a concoction of <i>Mazzini’s, </i>and that tells you in advance in what spirit and phraseology the real question, the labour question, was dealt with. As well as how the <strong>nationalities</strong> question intruded into it.</p>
<p>What is more, an old Owenite, Weston — now a <strong>manufacturer</strong> himself, a very amiable and worthy man — had drawn up a programme full of extreme confusion and of indescribable breadth.</p>
<p>The subsequent full committee meeting instructed the Sub-Committee to remodel Weston’s programme, ditto Wolff’s <strong>regulations</strong>. Wolff himself left to attend the congress of the <strong>Italian Workingmen’s Associations</strong> in Naples and persuade them to join the central association in London.</p>
<p>A further meeting of the Sub-Committee, which again I did not attend, as I was informed of their rendezvous too late. At this meeting, ‘<i>une dclaration des principes</i>’ and a revised version of Wolff’s rules were presented by Le Lubez and accepted by the Sub-Committee for submission to the full committee. The full committee met on 18 October. Eccarius wrote to me that it was a case of <i>periculum in mora </i><span class="context">[danger in delay]</span>, so I went along and was really shocked when I heard the worthy Le Lubez read out a fearfully clich-ridden, badly written and totally unpolished preamble <strong>pretending to be a declaration of principles</strong>, with Mazzini showing through the whole thing from beneath a crust of the most insubstantial scraps of French socialism. What is more, the Italian rules had by and large been adopted, whose aim, apart from all their other faults, was really something quite impossible, a sort of central government of the <i>European </i>working classes (with Mazzini in the background, of course). I remonstrated mildly, and, after prolonged debate. Eccarius proposed that the Sub-Committee should subject the thing to further ‘editing’. However, the <strong>sentiments</strong> expressed in Lubez’ <strong>declaration</strong> were carried.</p>
<p>Two days later, on 20 October, Cremer representing England, Fontana (Italy) and Le Lubez met at my house. (Weston was unable to be present.) I had not previously had the papers (Wolff’s and Le Lubez) in my hands, so could not prepare anything; but I was absolutely determined that <strong>not one single line</strong> of the stuff should be allowed to stand if I could help it. To gain time, I proposed that before we ‘edited’ the preamble, we ought to ‘discuss’ the <strong>Rules</strong>. This was done. It was 1 o'clock in the morning before the first of the 40 <strong>Rules</strong> was adopted. Cremer said (<i>and that was my whole aim</i>): we have nothing to put before the committee that is to meet on 25 October. We must postpone it until 1 November. But the Sub-Committee can meet on 27 October and attempt to reach a definite conclusion. This was agreed and the ‘papers’ were ‘bequeathed’ to me for my perusal.</p>
<p>I could see it was impossible to make anything out of the stuff. In order to justify the extremely peculiar way in which I intended to edit the <strong>sentiments</strong> that had already been ‘carried’, I wrote <strong>an Address to the Working Classes</strong> (which was not in the original plan; <strong>a sort of review of the adventures of the working classes since 1845</strong>); on the pretext that all the necessary facts were contained in this ‘Address’ and that we ought not to repeat the same things three times over, I altered the whole preamble, threw out the <i>declaration des principes </i>and finally replaced the 40 <strong>Rules</strong> by 10. Insofar as <strong>International politics</strong> is mentioned in the ‘Address’, I refer to <strong>countries</strong> and not to <strong>nationalities</strong>, and denounce Russia, not the <i>minores gentium</i> <span class="context">[smaller nations]</span>. The Sub-Committee adopted all my proposals. I was, however, obliged to insert two sentences about ‘<strong>duty’ </strong>and ‘<strong>right’,</strong> and ditto about ‘<strong>Truth, Morality and Justice’ </strong>in the preamble to the rules, but these are so placed that they can do no harm.”</p>
<p>At the meeting of the General Committee my ‘<strong>Address’,</strong> etc., was adopted with great enthusiasm (<strong>unanimously</strong>). The debate on the form of publication, etc., is to take place next Tuesday. Le Lubez has a copy of the ‘Address’ for translation into French and Fontana one for translation into Italian. (For a start there is a weekly <strong>called</strong> <i>Bee-Hive, </i>edited by Trade Unionist Potter, a sort of <i>Moniteur</i>.) I am to translate the stuff into German myself.</p>
<p>It was very difficult to frame the thing so that our view should appear in a form that would make it <strong>acceptable</strong> to the present outlook of the workers’ movement. In a couple of weeks, the same people will be having <strong>meetings</strong> on the franchise with Bright and Cobden. It will take time before the revival of the movement allows the old boldness of language to be used. We must be <i>fortiter in re, suaviter in modo. You will </i>get the stuff as soon as it is printed.</p>
<p>3.<i> Bakunin </i>sends his regards. He left today for Italy where he is living (Florence). I saw him yesterday for the first time in 16 years. I must say I liked him very much, more so than previously. With regard to the Polish movement, he said the Russian government had needed the movement to keep Russia itself quiet, but had not counted on anything like an 18-month struggle. They had thus provoked the affair in Poland. Poland had been defeated by two things, the influence of Bonaparte and, secondly, the hesitation of the Polish aristocracy in openly and unambiguously proclaiming <i>peasant socialism </i>from the outset. From now on — after the collapse of the Polish affair — he (Bakunin) will only involve himself in the socialist movement.</p>
<p>On the whole, he is one of the few people whom after 16 years I find to have moved forwards and not backwards. I also discussed Urquhart’s <strong>denunciations</strong> with him. (Apropos: the International Association will probably lead to a rupture between myself and these friends!') He inquired a great deal after yourself and Lupus. When I told him of the latter’s death, he said straightaway that the movement had suffered an irreplaceable loss.</p>
<p>4. <i>Crisis. </i>By no means burnt out on the Continent yet (esp. France). Incidentally, what the crises have lost in intensity, they have now gained in frequency.</p>

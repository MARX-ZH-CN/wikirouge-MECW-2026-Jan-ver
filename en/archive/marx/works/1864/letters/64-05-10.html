<h4>[Manchester,] 10 May 1864</h4>
<p>Dear Jenny,</p>
<p><strong>Poor</strong> Lupus, as it now transpires — and as Borchardt already knew — had accumulated a nest-egg by dint of hard and unremitting work.</p>
<p>In his will (of December 1863) he appointed Engels, Borchardt and myself his executors, and the notary has just read us his will. In it he leaves:</p>
<p class="fst">1. £100 to the Manchester Schiller Institute</p>
<p class="fst">2. £100 to Engels</p>
<p class="fst">3. £100 to Borchardt and</p>
<p class="fst">4. The entire residue, amounting to six or seven hundred pounds, to me (to you and the children should I<i> predecease </i>him; he took care of all eventualities), likewise his books and all other effects.</p>
<p>I must now go to his lodgings and sort out his papers. Luckily he was living — during the final 6 or 7 weeks, at any rate — with exceptionally good and worthy people and enjoyed the best possible nursing. The inane telegrams about nursing attendants — of which Gumpert knew nothing — were sheer ostentation and consequentiality on the part of Bombastus B.</p>
<p>A thousand kisses to you and the children.</p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
Karl</p>

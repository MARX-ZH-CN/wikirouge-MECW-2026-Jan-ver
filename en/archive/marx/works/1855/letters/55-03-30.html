<h4>[London,] 30 March 1855, 28 Dean Street, Soho</h4>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>From day to day I have put off sending you a bulletin because the ups and downs of the illness were such that I changed my opinion almost hourly. Latterly, however, the illness has assumed the character, hereditary in my family, of an abdominal consumption, and even the doctor seems to have given up hope. For the past week emotional stress has made my wife iller than ever before. As for myself, though my heart is bleeding and my head afire, I must, of course, maintain my composure. Never for one moment throughout his illness has the child been untrue to his own good-natured, and at the same time independent, self.</p>
<p>As for you, I cannot thank you enough for the kindness with which you have worked in my stead, and for the sympathy you have shown towards the child.</p>
<p>Should there be any change for the better, I shall write to you at once.</p>
<p class="sig"><i>Tous tuus</i>,<br>
K. M.</p>
<p><i>Notabene</i>. There’s no sailing for America next Tuesday and it doesn’t do to send the chaps two articles at once every time. So give this Tuesday a miss.</p>

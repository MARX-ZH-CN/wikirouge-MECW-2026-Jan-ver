<h3>The Labor Movement in America</h3>
<p class="fst">Ten months have elapsed since, at the translator’s wish, I
wrote the Appendix<sup class="enote"><a href="#n1">[1]</a></sup> to this book;
and during these ten months, a revolution has been accomplished in American
society such as, in any other country, would have taken at least ten years. In
February 1885, American public opinion was almost unanimous on this one point;
that there was no working class, in the European sense of the word, in America;
that consequently no class struggle between workmen and capitalists, such as
tore European society to pieces, was possible in the American Republic; and
that, therefore, Socialism was a thing of foreign importation which could never
take root on American soil.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n2">[2]</a></sup> And
yet, at that moment, the coming class struggle was casting its gigantic shadow
before it in the strikes of the Pennsylvania coal-miners, and of many other
trades, and especially in the preparations, all over the country, for the great
Eight Hours’ movement which was to come off, and did come off, in the May
following. That I then duly appreciated these symptoms, that I anticipated a
working-class movement on a national scale, my “Appendix” shows;
but no one could then foresee that in such a short time the movement would
burst out with such irresistible force, would spread with the rapidity of a
prairie-fire, would shake American society to its very foundations.</p>
<p>The fact is there, stubborn and indisputable. To what an extent it had
struck with terror the American ruling classes, was revealed to me, in an
amusing way, by American journalists who did me the honor of calling on me last
summer; the “new departure” had put them into a state of helpless
fright and perplexity. But at that time the movement was only just on the
start; there was but a series of confused and apparently disconnected upheavals
of that class which, by the suppression of negro slavery and the rapid
development of manufactures, had become the lowest stratum of American society.
Before the year closed, these bewildering social convulsions began to take a
definite direction. The spontaneous, instinctive movements of these vast masses
of working people, over a vast extent of country, the simultaneous outburst of
their common discontent with a miserable social condition, the same everywhere
and due .to the same causes, made them conscious of the fact, that they formed
a new and distinct class of American society; a class of — practically
speaking — more or less hereditary wage-workers, proletarians. And with
true American instinct this consciousness led them at once to take the next
step towards their deliverance: the formation of a political
working-men’s party, with a platform of its own, and with the conquest of
the Capitol and the White House for its goal. In May the struggle for the Eight
Hours’ working-day, the troubles in Chicago, Milwaukee, etc., the
attempts of the ruling class to crush the nascent uprising of Labor by brute
force and brutal class-justice; in November the new Labor Party organized in
all great centres, and the New York, Chicago and Milwaukee elections. May and
November have hitherto reminded the American bourgeoisie only of the payment of
coupons of U.S. bonds; henceforth May and November will remind them, too, of
the dates on which the American working-class presented <i>their </i>coupons
for payment.</p>
<p>In European countries, it took the working class years and years before they
fully realized the fact that they formed a distinct and, under the existing
social conditions, a permanent class of modern society; and it took years again
until this class consciousness led them to form themselves into a distinct
political party, independent of, and opposed to, all the old political parties
formed by the various sections of the ruling classes. On the more favored soil
of America, where no mediæval ruins bar the way, where history begins with the
elements of modern bourgeois society as evolved in the seventeenth century, the
working class passed through these two stages of its development within ten
months.,</p>
<p>Still, all this is but a beginning. That the laboring masses should feel
their community of grievances and of interests, their solidarity as a class in
opposition to all other classes; that in order to give expression and effect to
this feeling, they should set in motion the political machinery provided for
that purpose in every free country — that is the first step only. The
next step is to find the common remedy for these common grievances, and to
embody it in the platform of the new Labor Party. And this — the most
important and the most difficult step in the movement — has yet to be
taken in America.</p>
<p>A new party must have a distinct positive platform; a platform which may
vary in details as circumstances vary and as the party itself develops, but
still one upon which the party, for the time being, is agreed. So long as such
a platform has not been worked out, or exists but in a rudimentary form, so
long the new party, too, will have but a rudimentary existence; it may exist
locally but not. yet nationally, it will be a party potentially but not
actually.</p>
<p>That platform, whatever may be its first shape, must develop in a direction
which may be determined beforehand. The causes that brought into existence the
abyss between the working class and the capitalist class are the same in
America as in Europe; the means of filling up that abyss are equally the same
everywhere. Consequently, the platform of the American proletariat will in the
long run coincide, as to the ultimate end to be attained, with the one which,
after sixty years of dissensions and discussions, has become the adopted
platform of the great mass of the European militant proletariat. It will
proclaim, as the ultimate end, the conquest of political supremacy by the
working class, in order to effect the direct appropriation of all means of
production — land, railways, mines, machinery, etc. — by society at
large, to be worked in common by all for the account and benefit of all.</p>
<p>But if the new American party, like all political parties everywhere, by the
very fact of its formation aspires to the conquest of political power, it is as
yet far from agreed upon what to do with that power when once attained. In New
York and the other great cities of the East, the organization of the working
class has proceeded upon the lines of Trades’ Societies, forming in each
city a powerful Central Labor Union. In New York the Central Labor Union, last
November, chose for its standard-bearer Henry George, and consequently its
temporary electoral platform has been largely imbued with his principles. In
the great cities of the North-West the electoral battle was fought upon a
rather indefinite labor platform, and the influence of Henry George’s
theories was scarcely, if at all, visible. And while in these great centres of
population and of industry the new class movement came to a political head, we
find all over the country two wide-spread labor organizations: the
“Knights of Labor” and the “Socialist Labor Party,” of
which only the latter has a platform in harmony with the modern European
standpoint as summarized above.</p>
<p>Of the three more or less definite forms under which the American labor
movement thus presents itself, the first, the Henry George movement in New
York, is for the moment of a chiefly local significance. No doubt New York is
by far the most important city of the States; but New York is not Paris and the
United States are not France. And it seems to me that the Henry George
platform, in its present shape, is too narrow to form the basis for anything
but a local movement, or at best for a short-lived phase of the general
movement. To Henry George, the expropriation of the mass of the people from the
land is the great and universal cause of the splitting up of the people into
Rich and Poor. Now this is not quite correct historically. In Asiatic and
classical antiquity, the predominant form of class oppression was slavery, that
is to say, not so much the expropriation of the masses from the land as the
appropriation of their persons. When, in the decline of the Roman Republic, the
free Italian peasants were expropriated from their farms, they formed a class
of “poor whites” similar to that of the Southern Slave States
before 1861; and between slaves and poor whites, two classes equally unfit for
self-emancipation, the old world went to pieces. In the middle ages, it was not
the expropriation of the people from, but on the contrary, their appropriation
to the land which became the source of feudal oppression. The peasant retained
his land, but was attached to it as a serf or villein, and made liable to
tribute to the lord in labor and in produce. It was only at the dawn of modern
times, towards the end of the fifteenth century, that the expropriation of the
peasantry on a large scale laid the foundation .for the modern class of
wage-workers who possess nothing but their labor-power and can live only by the
selling of that labor-power to others. But if the expropriation from the land
brought this class into existence, it was the development of capitalist
production, of modern industry and agriculture on a large scale which
perpetuated it, increased it, and shaped it into a distinct class with distinct
interests and a distinct historical mission. All this has been fully expounded
by Marx (“Capital,” Part VIII: “The So-Called Primitive
Accumulation”). According to Marx, the cause of the present antagonism of
the classes and of the social degradation of the working class is their
expropriation from all means of production, in which the land is of course
included.</p>
<p>If Henry George declares land-monopolization to be the sole cause of poverty
and misery, he naturally finds the remedy in the resumption of the land by
society at large. Now, the Socialists of the school of Marx, too, demand the
resumption, by society, of the land, and not only of the land but of all other
means of production likewise. But even if we leave these out of the question,
there is another difference. What is to be done with the land? Modern
Socialists, as represented by Marx, demand that it should be held and worked in
common and for common account, and the same with all other means of social
production, mines, railways, factories, etc.; Henry George would confine
himself to letting it out to individuals as at present, merely regulating its
distribution and applying the rents for public, instead of, as at present, for
private purposes. What the Socialists demand, implies a total revolution of the
whole system of social production; what Henry George demands, leaves the
present mode of social production untouched, and has, in fact, been anticipated
by the extreme section of Ricardian bourgeois economists who, too, demanded the
confiscation of the rent of land by the State.</p>
<p>It would of course be unfair to suppose that Henry George has said his last
word once for all. But I am bound to take his theory as I find it.</p>
<p>The second great section of the American movement is formed by the Knights
of Labor.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n3">[3]</a></sup> And that seems to be
the section most typical of the present state of the movement, as it is
undoubtedly by far the strongest. An immense association spread over an immense
extent of country in innumerable “assemblies,” representing all
shades of individual and local opinion within the working class; the whole of
them sheltered under a platform of corresponding indistinctness and held
together much less by their impracticable constitution than by the instinctive
feeling that the very fact of their clubbing together for their common
aspiration makes them a great power in the country; a truly American paradox
clothing the most modern tendencies in the most mediaeval mummeries, and hiding
the most democratic and even rebellious spirit behind an apparent, but really
powerless despotism — such is the picture the Knights of Labor offer to a
European observer. But if we are not arrested by mere outside whimsicalities,
we cannot help seeing in this vast agglomeration an immense amount of potential
energy evolving slowly but surely into actual force. The Knights of Labor are
the first national organization created by the American working class as a
whole; whatever be their origin and history, whatever their shortcomings and
little absurdities, whatever their platform and their constitution, here they
are, the work of practically the whole class of American wage-workers, the only
national bond that holds them together, that makes their strength felt to
themselves not less than to their enemies, and that fills them with the proud
hope of future victories. For it would not be exact to say, that the Knights of
Labor are liable to development. They are constantly in full process of
development and revolution; a heaving, fermenting mass of plastic material
seeking the shape and form appropriate to its inherent nature. That form will
be attained as surely as historical evolution has, like natural evolution, its
own immanent laws. Whether the Knights of Labor will then retain their present
name or not, makes no difference, but to an outsider it appears evident that
here is the raw material out of which the future of the American working-class
movement, and along with it, the future of American society at large, has to be
shaped.</p>
<p>The third section consists of the Socialist Labor Party.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n4">[4]</a></sup> This section is a party but in name,
for nowhere in America has it, up to now, been able actually to take its stand
as a political party. It is, moreover, to a certain extent foreign to America,
having until lately been made up almost exclusively by German immigrants, using
their own language and for the most part, conversant with the common language
of the country. But if it came from a foreign stock, it came, at the same time,
armed with the experience earned during long years of class struggle in Europe,
and with an insight into the general conditions of working-class emancipation,
far superior to that hitherto gained by American working-men. This is a
fortunate circumstance for the American proletarians who thus are enabled to
appropriate, and to take advantage of, the intellectual and moral fruits of the
forty years’ struggle of their European classmates, and thus to hasten on
the time of their own victory. For, as I said before, there cannot be any doubt
that the ultimate platform of the American working class must and will be
essentially the same as that now adopted by the whole militant working class of
Europe, the same as that of the German-American Socialist Labor Party. In so
far this party is called upon to play a very important part in the movement.
But in order to do so they will have to doff every remnant of their foreign
garb. They will have to become out and out American. They cannot expect the
Americans to come to them; they, the minority and the immigrants, must go to
the Americans, who are the vast majority and the natives. And to do that, they
must above all things learn English.</p>
<p>The process of fusing together these various elements of the vast moving
mass — elements not really discordant, but indeed mutually isolated by
their various starting-points — will take some time and will not come off
without a deal of friction, such as is visible at different points even now.
The Knights of Labor, for instance, are here and there, in the Eastern cities,
locally at war with the organized Trades Unions. But then this same friction
exists within the Knights of Labor themselves, where there is anything but
peace and harmony. These are not symptoms of decay, for capitalists to crow
over. They are merely signs that the innumerable hosts of workers, for the
first time set in motion in a common direction, have as yet found out neither
the adequate expression for their common interests, nor the form of
organization best adapted to the struggle, nor the discipline required to
insure victory. They are as yet the first levies <i>en masse </i>of the great
revolutionary war, raised and equipped locally and independently, all
converging to form one common army, but as yet without regular organization and
common plan of campaign. The converging columns cross each other here and
there: confusion, angry disputes, even threats of conflict arise. But the
community of ultimate purpose in the end overcomes all minor troubles; ere long
the straggling and squabbling battalions will be formed in a long line of
battle array, presenting to the enemy a well-ordered front, ominously silent
under their glittering arms, supported by bold skirmishers in front and by
unshakeable reserves in the rear.</p>
<p>To bring about this result, the unification of the various independent
bodies into one national Labor Army, with no matter how inadequate a
provisional platform, provided it be a truly working-class platform —
that is the next great step to be accomplished in America. To effect this, and
to make that platform worthy of the cause, the Socialist Labor Party can
contribute a great deal, if they will only act in the same way as the European
Socialists have acted at the time when they were but a small minority of the
working class. That line of action was first laid down in the “Communist
Manifesto” of 1847 in the following words:</p>
<p class="indentb">“The Communists” — that was the name we
took at the time and which even now we are far from repudiating —
“the Communists do not form a separate party opposed to other
working-class parties.</p>
<p class="indentb">“They have no interests separate and apart from the
interests of the whole working class.</p>
<p class="indentb">“They do not set up any sectarian principles of their
own, by which to shape and model the proletarian movement.</p>
<p class="indentb">“The Communists are distinguished from the other
working-class parties by this only: 1. In the national struggles of the
proletarians of the different countries they point out, and bring to the front,
the common interests of the whole proletariat, interests independent of all
nationality; 2. In the various stages of development which the struggle of the
working class against the capitalist class has to pass through, they always and
everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole.</p>
<p class="indentb">“The Communists, therefore, are on the one hand,
practically the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties
of all countries, that section which ever pushes forward all others; on the
other hand, theoretically, they have, over the great mass of the proletarians,
the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march, the conditions, and
the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement.</p>
<p class="indentb">“Thus they fight for the attainment of the immediate
ends, for the enforcement of the momentary interests of the working class; but
in the movement of the present, they represent and take care of the future of
the movement.”</p>
<p>That is the line of action which the great founder of Modern Socialism, Karl
Marx, and with him, I and the Socialists of all nations who worked along with
us, have followed for more than forty years, with the result that it has led to
victory everywhere, and that at this moment the mass of European Socialists, in
Germany and in France, in Belgium, Holland and Switzerland, in Denmark and
Sweden as well as in Spain and Portugal, are fighting as one common army under
one and the same flag.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<hr class="end"/>
<p class="information"><a id="n1"><span class="info">1.</span></a> The
Appendix to the American edition of <i>The Condition of the Working Class in
England </i>was, except for the paragraph quoted in the next footnote, used by
Engels as the basis of his Preface to the English edition of 1892. (See present
volume, pp. 17-33.)</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n2"><span class="info">2.</span></a> In the
Appendix Engels wrote:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“There were two circumstances which for a long time
prevented the unavoidable consequences of the Capitalist system from showing
themselves in the full glare of day in America. These were the easy access to
the ownership of cheap land, and the influx of immigration. They allowed, for
many years, the great mass of the native American population to
“retire” in early manhood from wage-labour and to become’
farmers, dealers, or employers of labour, while the hard work for wages, the
position of a proletarian for life, mostly fell to the lot of immigrants. But
America has outgrown this early stage. The boundless backwoods have
disappeared, and the still more boundless prairies are faster and faster
passing from the hands of the Nation and the States into those of private
owners. The great safety-valve against the formation of a permanent proletarian
class has practically ceased to act. A class of life-long and even hereditary
proletarians exists at this hour in America. A nation of sixty millions
striving hard to become — and with every chance of success, too —
the leading manufacturing nation of the world — such a nation cannot
permanently import its own wage-working class; riot even if immigrants pour in
at the rate of half a million a year. The tendency of the Capitalist system
towards the ultimate splitting-up of society into two classes, a few
millionaires on the one hand, and a great mass of mere wage-workers on the
other, this tendency, though constantly crossed and counteracted by other
social agencies, works nowhere with greater force than in America; and the
result has been the production of a class of native American wage-workers, who
form, indeed, the aristocracy of the wage-working class as compared with the
immigrants, but who become conscious more and more every day of their
solidarity with the latter and who feel all the more acutely their present
condemnation to life-long wage-toil, because they still remember the bygone
days, when it was comparatively easy to rise to a higher social level.”

Noble Order </i>of <i>the Knights of Labour: A </i>working-class
organisation founded in Philadelphia in 1869. Existing illegally until 1878 it
observed a semi-mysterial ritual. That year the organisation emerged from the
underground, retaining some of its secret features. The Knights of Labour aimed
at the liberation of the workers by means of co-operatives. They took in all
skilled and even unskilled trades, without discrimination on account of sex,
race, nationality or religion. The organisation reached the highest point of
its activity during the eighties, when, under the pressure of the masses, the
leaders of the Order were compelled to consent to an extensive strike movement.
Its membership at that time was over 700,000, including 60,000 Negroes.
However, on account of the opportunist tactics of the leaders, who were opposed
to revolutionary class struggle, the order forfeited its prestige among the
masses. Its activity expired the next decade.</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n4"><span class="info">4.</span></a> The
<i>Socialist Labour Party </i>came into existence in 1876 as a result of the
union of the American sections of the First International with other
working-class socialist organisations in the United States. This party
consisted mainly of immigrants, particularly Germans. Its activities were
sectarian and its leaders were incapable of heading the mass movement of the
American workers, as they refused to work in the trade unions.</p>

<p>Dear Baron,</p>
<p>Marx’s two chapters despatched by registered mail at the same time as this. You might entitle them: ‘From Book III of <i>Capital </i>by K. Marx’ – I and II, and indicate in a note that these are Chapters XXIII and XXIV, taken from Part V, ‘Division of<i> </i>Profit into Interest and Profit of Enterprise. Interest- bearing Capital’. The titles of<i> </i>the chapters must be retained in each case. In order to simplify things I have deleted the Greek, also all the notes save one important one.</p>
<p>The article ‘On the History of<i> </i>Early Christianity’ – that is what I shall probably call the thing – is in hand and, WELL ADVANCED. But yesterday there was a Handel festival at the Crystal Palace and Louise, I and the Avelings went to hear <i>The Messiah. </i>Today I have got to deal with my letters and tomorrow I shall probably buckle to again, but Liebknecht is here and we are having a heat-wave.</p>
<p>Thank you for the bit of<i> </i>the <i>Volksanwalt. </i>As regards the thing from the <i>Critica Sociale</i>, Victor has really been leading me up the garden path. After I had agreed to let him have it, he simply dropped the thing altogether and now proposes to await the moment when it ‘becomes topical’ again. Next time I shall be more wary; he treats his contributors in a very odd way. Well, I look forward keenly to seeing what the fate of<i> </i>your daily will be. Not, I hope, that of<i> </i>Guesde’s and Lafargue’s <i>Socialiste </i>quotidien ‘<i>pour paraître en octobre</i>’; only yesterday we were chaffing poor Bonnier about it when he passed this way.</p>
<p>So Carnot has been stabbed to death. A poor, stupid, boring fellow – the first Frenchman to rise to the top through being a bore – and <i>in France </i>too! But now Alexander III will repudiate the French alliance. ‘Merci’, he will say, ‘there’s plenty of<i> </i>that sort of thing to be had at home and at less expense!’ Incidentally, there might be a certain element of vengeance for Aiguesmortes in this. I shall be curious to see how the sixty self-styled ‘Socialists’ in the Chamber will now behave. That the affair will be exploited <i>à la </i>Hödel there can be no doubt, but on the other hand the sixty will weigh heavily in the scales at the presidential elections next Wednesday.</p>
<p>Kindest regards from one household to the other.</p>
<p class="sig">Yours,<br>
F. E.</p>
<p>27 June. Left unfinished yesterday,</p>
<p>Benno Karpeles intervened. During the past three days there has been 1. One Hellmut von Gerlach of Berlin, 2. Liebknecht, 3. Karpeles and, today, 4. Prof. Tonnies of<i> </i>Kiel – not to mention the Handel Festival the day before yesterday – so how can a man be expected to work?</p>

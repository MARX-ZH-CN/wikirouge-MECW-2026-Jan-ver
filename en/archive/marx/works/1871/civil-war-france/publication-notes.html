<p class="title">Civil War in France, Marx 1871</p>
<h3>Notes on the Publication of “<i>The Civil War in France</i>”
from <i>MECW</i> Volume 22</h3>
<hr class="end"/>
<p class="information"><a id="a0"><i>The Civil War in France</i>,</a> one
of Marx’s most important works, was written as an address by the General
Council of the International to all Association members in Europe and the
United States.</p>
<p class="information">From the earliest days of the Paris Commune Marx made a
point of collecting and studying all available information about its
activities.. He made clippings from all available French, English and German
newspapers of the time. Newspapers from Paris reached London with great
difficulty. Marx had at his disposal only individual issues of Paris newspapers
that supported the Commune. He had to use English and French bourgeois
newspapers published in London, including ones of Bonapartist leanings, but
succeeded in giving an objective picture of the developments in Paris. The
notebook with newspaper excerpts from March 18 to May 1, 1871 is extant (it was
published for the first time in the original languages in: <i>Civil War,
Archives</i>, Vol. III (VIII), Moscow, 1934).</p>
<p class="information">Marx also drew valuable information from the letters of
active participants and prominent figures of the Paris Commune, such as Leo
Frankel, Eugene Varlin, Auguste Serraillier, Yelisaveta Tornanovskaya, as well
as from the letters of Paul Lafargue, Pyotr Lavrov and others.</p>
<p class="information">Originally he intended to write an address to the
workers of Paris, as he declared at the meeting of the General Council on March
28, 1871. His motion was unanimously approved. The further developments in
Paris led him, however, to the conclusion that an appeal should be addressed to
proletarians of the world. At the General Council meeting on April 18, Marx
suggested to issue “an address to the International generally about the
general tendency of the struggle.” </p>
<p class="information">Marx was entrusted with drafting the address. He started
his work after April 18 and continued throughout May. Originally he wrote the
First and Second drafts of <i>The Civil War in France </i>as preparatory
variants for the work, and then set about making up the final text of the
address.</p>
<p class="information">He did most of the work on the First and Second drafts
and the final version roughly between May 6 and 30. On May 30, 1871, two days
after the last barricade had fallen in Paris, the General Council unanimously
approved the text of <i>The Civil War in France, </i>which Marx had read
out.</p>
<p class="information"><i>The Civil War in France </i>was first published in
London on about June 13, 1871 in English, as a pamphlet of 35 pages in 1,000
copies. Since the first edition quickly sold out, the second English edition of
2,000 copies was published at a lower price, for sale to workers. In this
edition [i.e., MECW], Marx corrected some of the misprints occurring in the
first edition, and the section “Notes” was supplemented with
another document. Changes were made in the list of General Council members who
signed the Address: the names of Lucraft and Odger were deleted, as they had
expressed disagreement with the Address in the bourgeois press and had
withdrawn from the General Council, and the names of the new members of the
General Council were added. In August 1871, the third English edition of
<i>The Civil War in France </i>came out, in which Marx eliminated the
inaccuracies of the previous editions.</p>
<p class="information">In 1871-72, <i>The Civil War in France </i>was
translated into French, German, Russian, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Flemish,
Serbo-Croat, Danish and Polish, and published in the periodical press and as
separate pamphlets in various European countries and the USA. It was repeatedly
published in subsequent years.</p>
<p class="information">The German translation was made by Engels and published
in <i>Der Volksstaat </i>in June-July 1871 (Nos. 52-61, June 28 and July 1,
5, 8, 12, 16, 19, 22, 26 and 29), and, in abridged form, in <i>Der Vorbote
(Nos. </i>8-10) in August-October 1871, and it also came out as a separate
pamphlet in Leipzig. Engels made several insignificant alterations in the text.
By the fifth anniversary of the Paris Commune, in 1876, a new German edition
was put out, with minor corrections introduced in the text.</p>
<p class="information">In 1891, when preparing a jubilee German edition of
<i>The Civil War in France </i>to mark the 20th anniversary of the Paris
Commune, Engels once again edited the text of his translation. He also wrote an
introduction to this edition, emphasising the historical significance of the
experience of the Paris Commune, and its theoretical generalisation by Marx in
<i>The Civil War in France, </i>and also giving additional information on the
activities of the Communards from among the Blanquists and Proudhonists. Engels
included in this edition the First and Second addresses of the General Council
of the International Working Men’s Association on the Franco-Prussian
war, which were published in subsequent editions in different languages also
together with <i>The Civil War France.</i></p>
<p class="information"><i>The Civil War in France</i> was published in French
for the first time in <i>L’Internationale</i> in Brussels in
July-September 1871. A separate French edition appeared in Brussels in 1872; it
was edited by Marx, who made numerous changes in the proofs and retranslated
many passages.</p>
<p class="information">The first Russian edition of <i>The Civil War in
France, </i>which served as the basis for a number of subsequent printed and
hectographed publications, appeared in Zurich in 1871. In 1905, <i>The Civil
War in France </i>came out in Russian in a translation from the German edition
of 1891 (Burevestnik Publishers, Odessa). The second edition was brought out
under the editorship of Lenin by the same publishing house, also in 1905 during
the first Russian revolution. When editing the translation of <i>The Civil War
in France, </i>at the request of the publishers, Lenin introduced precise
economic and political terminology into the text, eliminated numerous mistakes
and inaccuracies of the previous edition of 1905 and restored those parts of
the text deleted by Tsarist censorship.</p>
<p class="information">In this volume [i.e., MECW Volume 22], <i>The Civil War
in France</i> is published according to the 3rd English edition of 1871,
collated with the German translations of 1871 and 1891. The most essential
textual differences are given in the footnotes. To establish Marx’s
sources, his notebook with excerpts from various newspapers was used.
References to the sources quoted or mentioned in the text are given according
to these excerpts. In a number of cases concerning decrees and other documents
of the Paris Commune, a reference is also given to the publications of the
official organs of the Commune. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="a3">Marx wrote the drafts of <i>The Civil War
in France</i>,</a> which are preparatory versions of this work, between
mid-April and May 23, 1871; after this, he started work on the final version of
<i>The Civil War in France </i>as an Address of the International Working
Men’s Association. Newspaper clippings and excerpts in Marx’s
notebook relating to the last week of the Paris Commune were used not in the
second draft, but in the final text of the Address itself.</p>
<p class="information">The manuscript of the first, more sizable draft, which
seems to have survived in full, fills eleven sheets, 22 pages altogether,
judging by Marx’s pagination (it is not on all sheets), the Second Draft
consisted of 13 sheets, of which only 11 have survived. The missing sheets
apparently contained item 4, which preceded extant item 5: “Opening of
the civil war. 18 March Revolution. Clement Thomas. Lecomte. The Affaire
Vendôme.” The last three unnumbered pages (see this volume, pp. 545-51)
contain, in the main, a new version of separate passages of the Second Draft.
Marx marked a large part of the text of the First and Second Drafts with
vertical and oblique lines, by which he usually indicated the passages included
in the final version of a text. Words and sentences crossed out by Marx by
horizontal lines are not reproduced in this edition (in some cases, the crossed
out passages that are of importance are reproduced in the footnotes). Both
manuscripts have numerous marks in the margins, parentheses, square brackets,
etc., that Marx made for himself. They are not reproduced in the present
edition.</p>
<p class="information">When Marx quotes or mentions the decrees and
proclamations of the Commune, he often gives the dates according to their
publication or reports of them in London newspapers.</p>
<p class="information">The drafts were not published in Marx’s and
Engels’ lifetime and for a long time after their death. Some excerpts
from the First Draft were published first, in Russian, in the USSR in
<i>Pravda, Nos. </i>72 and 76, March 14 and 18, 1933; both drafts were first
published in full in the USSR in 1934 in the language of the original
(English), and in a Russian translation in <i>Marx/Engels Archives, </i>Vol.
III (VIII), by the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the CC CPSU.</p>

<p class="information"><a id="a1">The first Address</a> (The General Council
of the International Workingmen’s Association on the War ) was written by
Marx between July 19 and 23, 1870. On July, 19, 1870, when the Franco-Prussian
war broke out, the General Council instructed Marx to draft an address on the
war, of which Marx informed Engels in his letter of July 20 (see present
edition, Vol. 44). The Address was adopted by the Standing Committee of the
General Council on July 23, and then unanimously approved at the Council
meeting on July 26, 1870. It was first published in English, in the London
<i>Pall Mall Gazette, No. </i>1702, July 28, 1870, and a few days later it
appeared as a leaflet in 1,000 copies, The Address was reprinted, in full or in
part, by a number of British provincial newspapers.</p>
<p class="information">As the first edition of the Address was quickly sold
out, on August 2, 1870, the General Council resolved to have additional 1,000
copies printed. In September that year, the first Address was published in
English again, together with the General Council’s second Address on the
Franco-Prussian war. In this edition, Marx corrected the misprints that had
occurred in the first edition of the First Address.</p>
<p class="information">On August 9, the General Council appointed a commission
to have the first Address translated into German and French and then
distributed. The commission included Marx, Jung, Serraillier and Eccarius. The
first German translation of the Address, made by Wilhelm Liebknecht, appeared
in <i>Der Volksstaat </i>(Leipzig), No. 63, August 7, 1870. Marx edited it
heavily, and made a new translation of more than half the text. The new German
translation of the Address was published in <i>Der Vorbote </i>(Geneva), No.
8, August 1870, and as a leaflet. Then it appeared in the <i>Arbeiter Union
</i>(New York), August 12; <i>Die</i> <i>Tagwacht </i>(Zurich), No. 26,
August 13; the <i>Volkswille </i>(Vienna), No. 26, August 13, and the
<i>Proletarier </i>(Augsburg), No. 56, August 21. By the twentieth
anniversary of the Paris Commune in 1891, Engels had the General
Council’s first and second addresses published in the book K. Marx,
<i>Der Burgerkrieg in Frankreich, </i>3rd German edition, Berlin, 1891,
<i>Vorwärts </i>Publishing House. The translation of the two addresses for
this edition was made by Louise Kautsky and edited by Engels.</p>
<p class="information">The French translation of the Address appeared in
<i>L’Égalité </i>No. 28. August 6, 1870: (Brussels), No. 82, August 7,
1870, Second Address of the General Council of the International Working
Men’s Association on the Franco-Prussian War was written by Marx between
September 6 and 9, 1870.</p>
<p class="information">On September 6, 1870, having examined the new situation
that had taken shape after the collapse of the Second Empire and the start of a
new stage of the war, the General Council of the International decided to issue
a second address on the Franco-Prussian war and, for that purpose, appointed a
commission including Marx, Jung, Milner and Serraillier.</p>
<p class="information">In his work on the Address, Marx used the material he
received fronm Engels, which exposed the efforts to justify, on
military-strategic grounds, the urge on the part of the Prussian military
clique, the Junkers and the bourgeoisie to annex French territory (see
Engels’ letter to Marx and Marx’s reply of September 4 and 10, 1870
respectively). The Address was unanimously adopted by a special meeting of the
General Council on September 9, 1870, and was circulated to all the bourgeois
London newspapers, which ignored it, with the exception of <i>The Pall Mall
Gazette</i> which published an excerpt from the Address in its issue No. 1745
of September 16, 1870. On September 11-13, it was issued as a leaflet in
English (1,000 copies); a new edition containing the First and Second addresses
appeared in late September. The misprints in the first edition were corrected
and some editorial changes made in it. The Address was published by the US
labour press: <i>The Working Man’s Advocate</i>, Chicago, No. 7,
October 8, 1870; <i>The National Standard</i>, No. 1573, November 12,
1870.</p>
<hr class="end"/>
<p class="information"><a id="a2">The Second Address</a> was translated into
German by Marx, who added several sentences intended for the German workers and
deleted some passages. This translation was published in the newspaper <i>Der
Volksstaat</i>, No. 76, September 21, 1870; in the journal <i>Der
Vorbote</i>, No. 10-11, October- November 1870; Volkswille, Wien, No. 37,
October 8, 1870; Die Tagewacht, Zurich, No. 33, October 1, 1870; and also as a
leaflet in Geneva. In 1891, Engels published the Second Address in a German
edition of The Civil War in France; the translation for that edition was made
by Louise Kautsky under Engels’ supervision.</p>
<p class="information">The French translation of the Second Address was
published in the newspapers <i>L’Internationale</i>, Nos. 93 and 99,
October 23 and December 4, 1870; in La Tribune de Bordeaux, September 21. 1870;
and, in an abridged form, in <i>L’Égalité</i>, No. 35, October 4, 1870.
It was also published in Antwerp in Flemish by <i>De Werker</i>, Nos. 51 and
52, October 16 and 24, 1870.</p>
<p class="information">In the present edition, the Second Address is published
according to the second edition of the English leaflet checked against the 1870
leaflet, which was translated into German by Marx. The major differences in
reading are given in footnotes. </p>

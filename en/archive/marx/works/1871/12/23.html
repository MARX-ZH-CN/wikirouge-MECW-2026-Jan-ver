<p>Sir, — In his last epistle to you, Mr. Charles Bradlaugh makes the report of the sitting of the General Council of December 12th — a sitting from which I was absent in consequence of illness — the pretext for discharging upon me his ruffianism. He says,</p>
<p class="quoteb">“I feel indebted to Karl Marx for his enmity.” </p>
<p>My enmity to Mr. Charles Bradlaugh! Ever since the publication of the “Address on the Civil War in France,” Mr. Bradlaugh’s voice has chimed in with the world-wide chorus of slander against the “International” and myself. I treated him, like the other revilers, with contemptuous silence. This was more than the grotesque vanity of that huge self-idolater could stand. I “calumniated” him because I took no notice of his calumnies. My silence drove him mad; in a public meeting he denounced, me as <i>a Bonapartist </i>because, in the “Address on the Civil War,” I had, forsooth, laid bare the historic circumstances that gave birth to the Second Empire. He now goes a step further and transforms me into a <i>police agent of Bismarck. </i>Poor man! He must needs show that the lessons he has recently received at Paris from the infamous Emile de Girardin and his <i>clique </i>are not lost upon him. For the present, I shall “betray him” to the German public by giving the greatest possible circulation to his epistle. If he be kind enough to</p>
<p>clothe his libels in a more tangible shape, I shall “betray him” to an English law-court.</p>
<p>I am, Sir,<br>
Yours obediently,</p>

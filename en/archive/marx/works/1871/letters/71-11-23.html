<h4>[London,] November 23, 1871</h4>
<p class="fst">
<a href="../../../../../glossary/orgs/f/i.html#first-international" target=_blank>The International</a> was founded in order to replace the Socialist or semi-Socialist sects by a real organisation of the working class for struggle.  The original Statutes and the Inaugural Address show this at the first glance. On the other hand the Internationalists could not have maintained themselves if the course of history had not already smashed up the sectarian system. The development of the system of Socialist sects and that of the real workers' movement always stand in inverse ratio to each other.  So long as the sects are (historically) justified, the working class is not yet ripe for an independent historic movement. As soon as it has attained this maturity ail sects are essentially reactionary.  Nevertheless what history has shown everywhere was repeated within the International. The antiquated makes an attempt to re-establish and maintain itself within the newly achieved form.</p>
<p>And the history of the International was a continual struggle on the part of the General Council against the sects and amateur experiments which attempted to assert themselves within the International itself against the genuine movement of the working class. This struggle was conducted at the Congresses, but far more in the private dealings of the General Council with the individual sections.</p>
<p>
In Paris, as the <a href="../../../../../glossary/terms/p/r.html#proudhonism" target=_blank>Proudhonists</a> (Mutualists) were co-founders of the Association, they naturally had the reins in their hands there for the first years. Later, of course, collectivist, positivist, etc., groups were formed in opposition to them.</p>
<p>
In Germany – the <a href="../../../../../glossary/people/l/a.html#lassalle" target=_blank>Lassalle</a> clique. I myself went on corresponding for two years with the notorious Schweitzer and proved irrefutably to him that Lassalle's organisation is nothing but a sectarian organisation and as such hostile to the organisation of the <i>genuine</i> workers' movement striven for by the International.  He had his "reasons" for not understanding this.</p>
<p>
At the end of 1868 the Russian, <a href="../../../../../glossary/people/b/a.html#bakunin" target=_blank>Bakunin</a>, entered the <i>International</i> with the aim of forming inside it a <i>second International</i> called the  “<i>Alliance of Social-Democracy,”  with himself as leader.</i>   He – a  man  devoid of theoretical knowledge – put forward the pretension that this separate body was to represent the scientific propaganda of the International, which was to be made the special function of this second <i>International within the International.</i></p>
<p>
His programme was a superficially scraped together hash of Right and Left – EQUALITY Of CLASSES (!), <i>abolition of the right of inheritance as the starting point</i> of the social movement (St. Simonistic nonsense), <i>atheism as a dogma</i> to be dictated to the members, etc., and as the main dogma <i>(Proudhonist), abstention from the political movement.</i></p>
<p>
This infant's spelling-book found favour (and still has a certain hold) in Italy and Spain, where the real conditions of the workers' movement are as yet little developed, and among a few vain, ambitious and empty doctrinaires in French Switzerland and Belgium.</p>
<p>
For Mr. <a href="../../../../../glossary/people/b/a.html#bakunin" target=_blank>Bakunin</a> the theory (the assembled rubbish he has scraped together from <a href="../../../../../glossary/people/p/r.html#proudhon" target=_blank>Proudhon</a>, St. Simon, etc.) is a secondary affair – merely a means to his personal self-assertion. If he is a nonentity as a theoretician he is in his element as an intriguer.</p>
<p>
For years the General Council had to fight against this conspiracy (which was supported up to a certain point by the French Proudhonists, especially in the <i>south of France).</i> At last, by means of Conference resolutions I  (2)  and (3), IX, XVI, and XVII, it delivered its long prepared blow.</p>
<p>
Obviously the General Council does not support in America what it combats in Europe. Resolutions I (2) and (3) and IX now give the New York committee legal weapons with which to put an end to all sectarian formations and amateur groups and if necessary to expel them.</p>
<p>
The New York Committee will do well to express its full agreement with the decisions of the Conference in an <i>official communication to the General Council.</i></p>
<p>
Bakunin, personally threatened in addition by Resolution XIV (publication in <i>Égalité</i> of the Netchaev trial) which will bring to light his infamous doings in Russia, is making every possible effort to get a protest started against the Conference among the remnants of his followers.</p>
<p>
For this purpose he has got into contact with the demoralised section of the French political refugees in Geneva and London (a numerically weak section, anyway). The slogan given out is that the Geneva Council is dominated by <i>Pan-Germanism</i> (especially Bismarckism). This refers to the<i> unpardonable</i> fact that I am by birth a German and do actually exercise a decisive intellectual influence on the German Council.  (N.B.  The <i>German</i> element on the Council is two-thirds weaker <i>numerically </i>than either the <i>English</i> or the <i>French.</i> The crime therefore consists in the fact that the English and French elements are dominated by the German element where <i>theory</i> is concerned (!) and find this domination, i.e., German science, very useful and indeed indispensable.)</p>
<p>
In Geneva, under the patronage of the bourgeois Madame Andrée Léo (who at the Lausanne Congress was shameless enough to denounce Ferré to his executioners in Versailles), they have published a paper,<i> La Révolution Sociale,</i> which conducts arguments against us in almost literally the same words as the <i>Journal de Genève,</i> the most reactionary paper in Europe.</p>
<p>
In London they attempted to establish a French section, of whose activities you will find an example in No. 42 of <i>Qui Vive?</i> which I enclose. (Also the number which contains the letter from our French Secretary, Seraillier). This section, consisting of twenty people (including a lot of spies), has not been recognised by the General Council, but another much more numerous section has been.</p>
<p>
Actually, despite the intrigues of this bunch of scoundrels, we are carrying on great propaganda in France--and in Russia, where they know what value to place on Bakunin and where my book on capital is just being published in Russian....</p>
<p>
<i>N.B. as to political movement:</i> The political movement of the working class has as its object, of course, the conquest of political power for the working class, and for this it is naturally necessary that a previous organisation of the working class, itself arising from their economic struggles, should have been developed up to a certain point.</p>
<p>
On the other hand, however, every movement in which the working class comes out as a class against the ruling classes and attempts to force them by pressure from without is a political movement.  For instance, the attempt in a particular factory or even a particular industry to force a shorter working day out of the capitalists by strikes, etc., is a purely economic movement. On the other hand the movement to force an eight-hour day, etc., <i>law</i> is a <i>political</i> movement. And in this way, out of the separate economic movements of the workers there grows up everywhere a <i>political</i> movement, that is to say a movement of the <i>class,</i> with the object of achieving its interests in a general form, in a form possessing a general social force of compulsion. If these movements presuppose a certain degree of previous organisation, they are themselves equally a means of the development of this organisation.</p>
<p>
Where the working class is not yet far enough advanced in its organisation to undertake a decisive campaign against the collective power, i.e., the political power of the ruling classes,
it must at any rate be trained for this by continual agitation against and a hostile attitude towards the policy of the ruling classes.  Otherwise it will remain a plaything in their hands, as the September revolution in France showed, and as is also proved up to a certain point by the game Messrs. <a href="../../../../../glossary/people/g/l.html#gladstone" target=_blank>Gladstone</a> &amp; Co. are bringing off in England even up to the present time.</p>

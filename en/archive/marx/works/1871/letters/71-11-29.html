<h4>November 29, 1871</h4>
<p>I come now to the question of MacDonnell.</p>
<p>Before admitting him, the Council instituted a most searching inquiry as to his integrity, he, like <i>all </i>other Irish politicians, being much calumniated by his own countrymen.</p>
<p>The Council — after most incontrovertible evidence on his private character — chose him because the <i>mass of the Irish workmen in England </i>have more confidence in him than in <i>any other person. </i>He is a man quite superior to religious prejudices and as to his general views, it is absurd to say that he has any “bourgeois” predilections. He is a proletarian, by his circumstances of life and by his ideas.</p>
<p>If any accusation is to be brought forward against him, let it be done in exact terms, and not by vague insinuation.</p>
<p>My opinion is that the Irishmen, removed for a long time by imprisonment, are not competent judges. The best proof is their relations with <i>The Irishman </i>whose editor, Pigott, is a mere speculator, and whose manager, Murphy, is a ruffian. That paper — despite the exertions of the General Council for the Irish cause — has always intrigued against us. MacDonnell was constantly attacked in that paper by an Irishman (O'Donnell) connected with Campbell (an officer of the London <i>Police</i>) and a habitual drunkard who for a glass of gin will tell the first constable all the secrets he may have to dispose of.</p>
<p>After the nomination of MacDonnell, Murphy attacked and calumniated the <i>International </i>(not only MacDonnell) in <i>The Irishman, </i>and, <i>at the same time, </i>secretly, asked us to nominate him secretary for Ireland.</p>
<p>As to O'Donovan Rossa, I wonder that you quote him still as an authority after what you have written me about him. If any man was obliged, personally, to the <i>International </i>and the French Communards, it was he, and you have seen what thanks we have received at his hands.</p>
<p>Let the Irish members of the New York Committee not forget that to be useful to them, we want above all <i>influence on the Irish in England, </i>and that for that purpose there exists, as far as we have been able to ascertain, no better man than MacDonnell.</p>

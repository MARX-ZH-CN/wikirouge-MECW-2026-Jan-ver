<h4>[London,] 9 November 1871</h4>
<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>Enclosed are a few changes <span class="context">[to the Russian translation of <i>Capital</i>]</span>, some of them just printing errors. Of some importance, however, are the changes on p. 192, p. 201, p. 288, Note 205a, and p. 376, which affect the content.</p>
<p>It would be pointless to wait for the revision of Chapter I, since for months now my time has been so taken up that I have not been able to get to my theoretical work (and the foreseeable future holds out small prospect of an improvement in this respect).</p>
<p>* Certainly, I shall one fine morning put a stop to all this but there are circumstances where you are in duty bound to occupy yourselves with things much less attractive than theoretical study and research.</p>
<p>My warmest thanks for all the kindness I have met with on your part<a id="art">.</a> The writings of Ehrlieb I am partly acquainted with. I compare him as a writer to Lessing and Diderot. </p>
<p>I have received some curious numbers of the <i>Moscow Gazette</i>.</p>
<p class="fst">Yours truly,*<br>
A. W.</p>

<p>I will not fail to draw the attention of the Catholic nobly-born members of the knighthood to a poem which, though written by a commoner, is perhaps for this very reason the more worthy of being preserved as a precious pearl, as a due tribute of bourgeois humility.</p>
<p>In the year of grace eighteen hundred and forty-two a booklet appeared in Erfurt published by F. W. Otto: <i>Das Wissemwürdigste der Heraldik oder Wappenhunde</i> by F. W. Andrea, with a dedication which reads as follows: “Respectfully dedicated to the entire high nobility of Germany, by the publisher.”</p>
<p class="quoteb">“The Aristocracy by Right are loftiest in the Land, <br>
The Virtues of Their Forebears always ranked full high.<br>
Hereditary Worth has waxed and multiplied,<br>
In no way doth the Present yield before the Past.<br>
Thus Reverence greets Them humbly everywhere They go,<br>
On every State the richest blessings They bestow.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“A Coat of Arms conceals a Wealth of hidden Meaning,<br>
How the sublimest Deeds were done in ancient Times;<br>
How Sovereigns gave the Nobles all Their just Deserts<br>
In War as well as in the palmy Days of Peace.<br>
Thus, Coats of Arms as high as Royal Crowns are rated:<br>
Only exalted Deeds are therewith consecrated.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“With all Humility and Deference deeply felt<br>
For Glory thus resplendent down the Aeons of Time,<br>
I dedicate this Monument of Reverence<br>
To the most lofty Scions of Virtue-breeding stock.<br>
Pray, of a great Intention take this feeble token;<br>
It might yet tell you what lay in my heart unspoken.”</p>
<p>Does the man not deserve to be knighted?</p>

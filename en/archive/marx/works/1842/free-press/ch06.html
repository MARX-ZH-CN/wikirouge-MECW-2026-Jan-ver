On Freedom of the Press

<h3>
[Freedom in General]
</h3>
<hr class="end"/>
<p>Freedom of the press is as little <i>responsible</i>
for the "changeable conditions" as the astronomer's telescope is for the
unceasing motion of the universe. Evil astronomy! What a fine time that
was when the earth, like a respectable townsman, still sat in the centre
of the universe, calmly smoked its clay pipe, and did not even have to
put on the light for itself, since the sun, moon and stars like so many
obedient night lamps and "fine things" revolved around it.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">"He who never destroys what he has built, ever stands
<br>On this terrestrial world, which itself never stands still,"
<br>says Hariri, who is no Frenchman by birth, but an Arab." <a href="#1" id="a1"><sup class="ednote">[A]</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
The <i>estate</i> of the speaker finds expression very definitely in the
thought:
</p>
<p class="quote">"The true, honest patriot is unable to suppress his feeling that constitution
and freedom of the press exist not for the welfare of the people, but to
satisfy the ambition of individuals and for the domination of parties."
</p>
<p>
It is well known that a certain kind of psychology explains big things
by means of small causes and, correctly sensing that everything for which
man struggles is a matter of his interest, arrives at the incorrect opinion
that there are only "petty" interests, only the interests of a stereotyped
self-seeking. Further, it is well known that this kind of psychology and
knowledge of mankind is to be found particularly in <i>towns</i>, where
moreover it is considered the sign of a clever mind to see through the
world and perceive that behind the passing clouds of ideas and facts there
are quite small, envious, intriguing manikins, who pull the strings setting
everything in motion. However, it is equally well known that if one looks
too closely into a glass, one bumps <i>one's own head,</i> and hence these
clever people's knowledge of mankind and the universe is primarily a mystified
bump of their own heads.
</p>
<p>Half-heartedness and indecision are also characteristic of the
speaker's estate.
</p>
<p class="quote">"His feeling of independence inclines him to favour freedom of the
press" (in the sense of the mover of the motion), "but he must listen to
the voice of reason and experience."
</p>
<p>
If the speaker had said in conclusion that while his reason disposed him
in favour of freedom of the press his feeling of dependence set him against
it, his speech would have been a perfect genre picture of urban reaction.
</p>
<p class="quoteb">"He who has a tongue and does not speak,
<br>Who has a sword and does not fight,
<br>What is he indeed but a wretched wight?"
</p>
<p><a id="s2"> </a>
We come now to the <i>defenders of press freedom</i> and begin with the
<i>main motion</i>. We pass over the more general material, which is aptly
and well expressed in the introductory words of the motion, in order at
once to stress the peculiar and characteristic standpoint of this speech.
</p>
<p>The mover of the motion desires that <i>freedom of the press</i>
should not be excluded from the <i>general freedom to carry on a trade</i>,
a state of things that still prevails, and by which the inner contradiction
appears as a classical example of inconsistency.
</p>
<p class="quote">"The work of arms and legs is free, but that of the brain is under
tutelage. Of cleverer brains no doubt? God forbid, that does not come into
question as far as the censors are concerned. To him whom God gives an
official post, He gives also understandingly!"
</p>
<p>
The first thing that strikes one is to see <i>freedom of the press</i>
included under <i>freedom of trade</i>. However, we cannot simply reject
the speaker's view. <i>Rembrandt</i> painted the Madonna as a Dutch peasant
woman; why should our speaker not depict freedom in a form which is dear
and familiar to him?
</p>
<p>No more can we deny that the speaker's point of view has a certain
<i>relative</i> truth. If the press <i>itself</i> is regarded <i>merely</i>
as a trade, then, as a trade carried on by means of the brain, it deserves
greater freedom than a trade carried on by means of arms and legs. The
emancipation of arms and legs only becomes humanly significant through
the emancipation of the brain, for it is well known that arms and legs
become human arms and legs only because of the head which they serve.
</p>
<p>Therefore, however peculiar the speaker's point of view may appear
at first glance, we must absolutely prefer it to the empty, nebulous and
blurry arguments of those German liberals who think freedom is honoured
by being placed in the starry firmament of the imagination instead of on
the solid ground of reality. It is in part to these exponents of the imagination,
these sentimental enthusiasts, who shy away from any contact of their ideal
with ordinary reality as a profanation, that we Germans owe the fact that
freedom has remained until now a fantasy and sentimentality.
</p>
<p>Germans are in general inclined to sentiment and high-flown extravagance,
they have a weakness for music of the blue sky. It is therefore gratifying
when the great problem of the idea is demonstrated to them from a tough,
real standpoint derived from the immediate environment. Germans are by
nature most devoted, servile and respectful. Out of sheer respect for ideas
they fail to realise them. They make the worship of them into a cult, but
they do not cultivate them. Hence the way adopted by the speaker seems
suitable for <i>familiarising</i> Germans with his ideas, for showing them
that it is not a question here of something inaccessible to them, but of
their immediate interests, suitable for translating the language of the
gods into that of man.
</p>
<p>We know that the Greeks believed that in the Egyptian, Lydian
and even Scythian gods they could recognise their Apollo, their Athena,
their Zeus, and they disregarded the specific features of the foreign cults
as subsidiary. It is no crime, therefore, if the German takes the goddess
of freedom of the press, a goddess unknown to him, for one of his familiar
goddesses, and accordingly calls it freedom of trade or freedom of property.
</p>
<p>Precisely because we are able to acknowledge and appreciate the
speaker's point of view, we <i>criticise</i> it the more severely.
</p>
<p class="quote">"One could very well imagine the continued existence of crafts side
by side with freedom of the press, because trade based on brain work could
require a <i>higher degree of skill, </i>putting it on the same level as
the seven free arts of old; but the continued unfreedom of the press alongside
freedom of trade is a sin against the Holy Ghost."
</p>
<p>
Of course! The lower form of freedom is obviously considered to be without
rights if the higher form has no rights. The right of the individual citizen
is a folly if the right of the state is not recognised. If freedom in general
is rightful, it goes without saying that a particular form of freedom is
the more rightful as freedom has achieved in it a finer and better-developed
existence. If the <i>polyp</i> <span class="inote">[jellyfish]</span> has a right to existence because the life
of nature is at least dimly evident in it, how much more so the lion in
which life rages and roars<a id="s3">?</a>
</p>
<p>However correct the conclusion that the existence of a higher
form of right can be considered proved by the existence of a lower form,
the <i>application</i> is wrong when it makes the lower sphere a <i>measure</i>
of the higher and turns its laws, reasonable within their own limits, into
caricatures by claiming that they are not laws of their own sphere, but
of a higher one. It is as if I wanted to compel a giant to live in the
house of a pigmy.
</p>
<p>Freedom of trade, freedom of property, of conscience, of the press,
of the courts, are all <i>species</i> of one and the same genus, of <i>freedom
without any specific name</i>. But it is quite incorrect to forget the
difference because of the unity and to go so far as to make a <i>particular
species</i> the measure, the standard, the sphere of other species. This
is an <i>intolerance</i> on the part of one species of freedom, which is
only prepared to tolerate the existence of others if they renounce themselves
and declare themselves to be its vassals.
</p>
<p>Freedom of trade is precisely freedom of trade and no other freedom
because within it the nature of the trade develops unhindered according
to the inner rules of its life. Freedom of the courts is freedom of the
courts if they follow their own inherent laws of right and not those of
some other sphere, such as religion. Every particular sphere of freedom
is the freedom of a particular sphere, just as every particular mode of
life is the mode of life of a particular nature. How wrong it would be
to demand that the lion should adapt himself to the laws of life of the
polyp! How false would be my understanding of the interconnection and unity
of the bodily organism if I were to conclude: since arms and legs function
in their specific way, the eye and ear — organs which take man away from
his individuality and make him the mirror and echo of the universe — must
have a still greater right to activity, and consequently must be <i>intensified</i>
arm-and-leg activity.
</p>
<p>As in the universe, each planet, while turning on its own axis,
moves only around the sun, so in the system of freedom each of its worlds,
while turning on its own axis, revolves only around the central sun of
freedom. To make freedom of the press a variety of freedom of trade is
a defence that kills it before defending it, for do I not abolish the freedom
of a particular character if I demand that it should be free in the manner
of a different character? Your freedom is not my freedom, says the press
to a trade. As you obey the laws of your sphere, so will I obey the laws
of my sphere. To be free in your way is for me identical with being unfree,
just as a cabinet-maker would hardly feel pleased if he demanded freedom
for his craft and was given as equivalent the freedom of the philosopher.
</p>
<p>Let us lay bare the thought of the speaker. What is freedom? He
replies: <i>Freedom of trade,</i> which is as if a student, when asked
what is freedom, were to reply: <i>It is freedom to be out at night</i>.
</p>
<p>With as much right as freedom of the press, one could include
every kind of freedom in freedom of trade. The judge practises the trade
of law, the preacher that of religion, the father of a family that of bringing
up children. But does that express the essence of legal, religious and
moral freedom?
</p>
<p>One could also put it the other way round and call freedom of
trade merely <i>a variety of freedom of the press.</i> Do craftsmen work
only with hands and legs and not with the brain as well? Is the language
of words the only language of thought? Is not the language of the mechanic
through the steam-engine easily perceptible to my ear, is not the language
of the bed manufacturer very obvious to my back, that of the cook comprehensible
to my stomach? Is it not a contradiction that all these varieties of freedom
of the press are permitted, the sole exception being the one that speaks
to my intellect through the medium of printer's ink<a id="s4">?</a>
</p>
<p>In order to defend, and even to understand, the freedom of a particular
sphere, I must proceed from its essential character and not its external
relations. But is the press true to its character, does it act in accordance
with the nobility of its nature, <i>is the press</i> free which degrades
itself to the level of a trade? The writer, of course, must earn in order
to be able to live and write, but he must by no means live and write to
earn.
</p>
<p>When <i>Béranger</i> sings:
</p>
<p class="quoteb">Je ne vis que pour faire des chansons,
<br>Si vous m'ôtez ma place Monseigneur
<br>Je ferai des chansons pour vivre.
</p>
<p class="quoteb"><span class="inote">[I live only to compose songs.
<br>If you dismiss me, Monseigneur,
<br>I shall compose songs in order to live.]</span>
</p>
<p>
This threat contains the ironic admission that the poet deserts his proper
sphere when for him poetry becomes a means.
</p>
<p>The writer does not at all look on his work as a <i>means</i>.
It is an <i>end in</i> <i>itself,</i> it is so little a means for him himself
and for others that, if need be, he sacrifices <i>his</i> existence to
<i>its</i> existence. He is, in another way, like the preacher of religion
who adopts the principle: "Obey God rather than man", including under man
himself with his human needs and desires. On the other hand, what if a
tailor from whom I had ordered a Parisian frock-coat were to come and bring
me a Roman toga on the ground that it was more in keeping with the eternal
law of beauty!
</p>
<p><i>The primary freedom of the press lies in not being a trade</i>.
The writer who degrades the press into being a material means deserves
as punishment for this internal unfreedom the external unfreedom of censorship,
or rather his very existence is his punishment.
</p>
<p>Of course, the press exists also as a trade, but then it is not
the affair of writers, but of printers and booksellers. However, we are
concerned here not with the freedom of trade of printers and booksellers,
but with freedom of the press.
</p>
<p>Indeed, our speaker does not stop at regarding the right to freedom
of the press proved because of freedom of trade; he demands that freedom
of the press, instead of being subject to its own laws, should be subject
to the laws of freedom of trade. He even joins issue with the spokesman
of the commission, who defends a higher view of freedom of the press, and
he puts forward demands which can only produce a comic effect, for it becomes
comic when the laws of a lower sphere are applied to a higher one, just
as, conversely, it has a comic effect when children become passionate.
</p>
<p class="quote">"He speaks of <i>authorised</i> and <i>unauthorised</i> authors. He
understands by this that even in the sphere of freedom of trade the exercise
of a right that has been granted is always bound up with some condition
which is more or less difficult to fulfil, depending on the occupation
in question. Obviously, masons, carpenters and master builders have to
fulfil conditions from which most other trades are exempt." "His motion
concerns a right in <i>particular</i>, not in <i>general</i>."
</p>
<p>
First of all, <i>who</i> is to grant <i>authority</i>? Kant would not have
admitted Fichte's authority as a philosopher, Ptolemy would not have admitted
that Copernicus had authority as an astronomer, nor Bernard of Clairvaux
Luther's authority as a theologian. Every man of learning regards his critics
as "<i>unauthorised authors</i>". Or should the unlearned decide who should
have the authority of a man of learning? Obviously the judgment would have
to be left to the unauthorised authors, for the authorised cannot be judges
in their own case. Or should authority be linked with <i>estate? </i>The
cobbler Jakob Böhme was a great philosopher. <a href="#2" id="a2"><sup class="ednote">[B]</sup></a>
 Many a philosopher of
repute is merely a great cobbler.
</p>
<p>By the way, when speaking of authorised or unauthorised authors,
to be consistent one must not rest content with distinguishing between
individual <i>persons</i>, one must divide the press as a trade into <i>various
trades</i> and draw up different trade certificates for the different spheres
of literary activity. Or ought the authorised writer to be able to write
about everything? From the outset, the cobbler has more authority than
the lawyer to write about leather. The day-labourer has just as much authority
as the theologian to write about whether one should work or not on holidays.
If, therefore, authority is linked with special objective conditions, every
citizen will be at one and the same time an authorised and an unauthorised
writer, authorised in matters concerning his profession, and unauthorised
in all others.
</p>
<p>Apart from the fact that in this way the world of the press, instead
of being a bond uniting the nation, would be a sure means of dividing it,
that the difference between the estates would thus be fixed intellectually,
and the history of literature would sink to the level of the natural history
of the particular intelligent breeds of animals; apart from the disputes
over the dividing lines between them and conflicts which could neither
be settled nor avoided; apart from the fact that lack of talent and narrow-mindedness
would become a law for the press, for the particular can be seen intellectually
and freely only in connection with the whole and therefore not in separation
from it — apart from all this, since reading is as important as writing,
there would have to be <i>authorised</i> and <i>unauthorised readers</i>,
a consequence which was drawn in Egypt, where the priests, the authorised
authors, were at the same time the sole authorised readers. And it is highly
expedient that only the authorised authors should be given authority to
buy and read their own works.
</p>
<p>What inconsistency If privilege prevails, the government has every
right to maintain that it is the <i>sole authorised author</i> as regards
what it does or does not do. For if you consider yourself authorised as
a citizen to write not only about your particular estate, but about what
is most general, viz., the state, should not other mortals, whom you wish
to exclude, be authorised as human beings to pass judgment on a very particular
matter, viz., <i>your authority</i> and your writings?
</p>
<p><i>The result would be the comical contradiction that the authorised
author might write without censorship about the state, but the unauthorised
author might write about the authorised author only by permission of the
censorship.</i>
</p>
<p>Freedom of the press will certainly not be achieved by a crowd
of official writers being recruited by you from your ranks. The authorised
authors would be the <i>official</i> authors, <i>the struggle between censorship
and freedom of the press would be converted into a struggle between authorised
and unauthorised writers.</i>
</p>
<p>Hence a member of the fourth estate correctly replies to this:
</p>
<p class="quote">"If some restriction on the press must still exist, let it be equal
for all parties, that is, that in this respect no one class of citizens
is allowed more rights than another".
</p>
<p>
The censorship holds us all in subjection, just as under a despotic regime
all are equal, if not in value, then in absence of value; that kind of
freedom of the press seeks to introduce oligarchy in the sphere of intellectual
life. The censorship declares that an author is at most inconvenient, unsuitable
within the bounds of its realm. That kind of freedom of the press claims
to anticipate world history, to know in advance the voice of the people,
which hitherto has been the sole judge as to which writer has "authority"
and which is "without authority". Whereas Solon did not venture to judge
a man until <i>after</i> his life was over, <i>after his death</i>, this
view presumes to judge a writer even <i>before his birth</i><a id="s5">.</a>
</p>
<p>The press is the most general way by which individuals can communicate
their intellectual being. It knows no respect for persons, but only respect
for intelligence. Do you want ability for intellectual communication to
be determined officially by special external signs? What I cannot be for
others, I am not and cannot be for myself. If I am not allowed to be a
spiritual force for others, then I have no right to be a spiritual force
for myself; and do you want to give certain individuals the privilege of
being spiritual forces? just as everyone learns to read and write, so everyone
must <i>have the right</i> to read and write.
</p>
<p><i>For whom,</i> then, is the division of writers into "authorised"
and "unauthorised" intended? Obviously not for the truly authorised, for
they can make their influence felt without that. Is it therefore for the
"unauthorised" who want to protect themselves and impress others by means
of an external privilege?
</p>
<p>Moreover, this palliative does not even make a <i>press law</i>
unnecessary, for, as a speaker from the peasant estate remarks:
</p>
<p class="quote">"Cannot a privileged person, too, exceed his authority and be liable
to punishment? Therefore, in any case, a press law would be necessary,
with the result that one would encounter the same difficulties as with
a <i>general law</i> <i>on the press."</i>
</p>
<p>
If the German looks back on his history, he will find one of the main reasons
for his slow political development, as also for the wretched state of literature
prior to <i>Lessing,</i> in the existence of <i>"authorised writers".</i>
The learned men by profession, guild or privilege, the doctors and others,
the colourless university writers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
with their stiff pigtails and their distinguished pedantry and their petty
hair-splitting dissertations, interposed themselves between the people
and the mind, between life and science, between freedom and mankind. It
was the unauthorised writers who created our literature. <i>Gottsched</i>
and Lessing-there you have the choice between an "authorised" and "unauthorised"
writer!
</p>
<p>In general, we have no liking for "freedom" that only holds good
in the plural. England is a proof on a big historical scale how dangerous
for "<i>freedom</i>" is the restricted horizon of "freedoms".
</p>
<p class="quote">"Ce mot des libertés," says Voltaire, "des privilèges,
suppose I'assujettissement. Des libertés sont des <i>exemptions</i>
de la servitude <i>générale."</i> <a href="#3" id="a3"><sup class="ednote">[C]</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
Further, if our speaker wants to exclude <i>anonymous</i> and <i>pseudonymous</i>
writers from freedom of the press and subject them to censorship, we would
point out that in the press it is not the name that matters, but that,
where a press law is in force, the publisher, and through him the anonymous
and pseudonymous writer as well, is liable to prosecution in the courts.
Moreover, when Adam gave names to all the animals in paradise, he forgot
to give names to the German newspaper correspondents, and they will remain
nameless in <i>saecula saeculorum.</i> <a href="#4" id="a4"><sup class="ednote">[D]</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Whereas the mover of the motion sought to impose restrictions
on <i>persons</i>, the subjects of the press, other estates want to restrict
the objective material of the press, the <i>scope of its operation and
existence</i>. The result is a soulless bargaining and haggling as to <i>how
much freedom freedom of the press ought to have.</i>
</p>
<p>One estate wants to limit the press to discussing the material,
intellectual and religious state of affairs in the Rhine Province; another
wants the publication of "local newspapers", whose title indicates their
restricted content; a third even wants free expression of opinion to be
allowed in <i>one newspaper only </i>in each province!!!
</p>
<p>All these attempts remind one of the gymnastics teacher who suggested
that the best way to teach how to jump was to take the pupil to a big ditch
and show him by means of a cotton thread how far he ought to jump across
the ditch. Of course, the pupil had first to practise jumping and would
not be allowed to clear the whole ditch on the first day, but from time
to time the thread would be moved farther away. Unfortunately, during his
first lesson the pupil fell into the ditch, and he has been lying there
ever since. The teacher was a German and the pupil's name was "freedom".
</p>
<p>According to the average <i>normal type</i>, therefore, the <i>defenders
of freedom of the press</i> in the Sixth Rhine Province Assembly differ
from their <i>opponents</i> not as regards content, but in their trend.
The narrow-mindedness of a <i>particular estate</i> opposes the press in
one case, and defends it in another; some want the government alone to
have privileges, others want them to be shared among more persons; some
want a full censorship, others a half censorship; some want three-eighths
freedom of the press, others none at all. God save me from my friends!
</p>
<p>Completely at variance with the <i>general spirit</i> of the Assembly,
however, are the speeches of the commission's <i>spokesman</i> and those
of some members of the <i>peasant estate.</i>
</p>
<p>Among other things, the spokesman declared:
</p>
<p class="quote">"In the life of peoples, as in that of individuals, it happens that
the fetters of a too long tutelage become intolerable, that there is an
urge for independence, and that everyone wants to be responsible himself
for his actions. Thereupon the censorship has outlived its time; where
it still exists it will be regarded as a <i>hateful</i> constraint which
prohibits what is openly said from being written."
</p>
<p>
Write as you speak, and speak as you write, our primary schoolteachers
taught us. Later what we are told is: say what has been prescribed for
you, and write what you repeat after others.
</p>
<p class="quote">"Whenever the inevitable progress of time causes a new, important interest
to develop and gives rise to a new need, for which no adequate provision
is contained in the existing legislation, new laws are necessary to regulate
this new state of society. Precisely such a case confronts us here."
</p>
<p>
That is the <i>truly historical</i> view in contrast to the illusory one
which kills the reason of history in order subsequently to honour its bones
as historical relics.
</p>
<p class="quote">"Of course, the problem" (of a press code) "may not be quite easy to
solve; the first attempt that is made will perhaps remain very incomplete
But all states will owe a debt of gratitude to the legislator who is the
first to take up this matter, and under a king like ours, it is perhaps
the Prussian government that is destined to have the <i>honour</i> to precede
other countries along this path, which alone can lead to the goal."
</p>
<p>
Our whole exposal has shown how <i>isolated</i> this courageous, dignified
and resolute view was in the Assembly. This was also abundantly pointed
out to the spokesman of the commission by the chairman himself. Finally,
it was expressed also by a member of the peasant estate in an ill-humoured
but excellent speech:
</p>
<p class="quote"><i>"The speakers have gone round and round the question before us like
a cat round hot porridge."</i> "The human spirit must develop freely <i>in
accordance with its inherent laws</i> and be allowed to communicate its
achievements, otherwise a clear, vitalising stream will become a pestiferous
swamp. If any nation is suitable for freedom of the press it is surely
the calm, good-natured German nation, which stands more in need of being
roused from its torpor than of the strait jacket of censorship. For it
not to be allowed freely to communicate its thoughts and feelings to its
fellow men very much resembles the North American system of solitary confinement
for criminals, which when rigidly enforced often leads to madness. From
one who is not permitted to find fault, praise also is valueless; in absence
of expression it is like a Chinese picture in which shade is lacking. Let
us not find ourselves put in the same company as this enervated nation!"
</p>
<p>
If we now look back on the press debates as a whole, we cannot overcome
the dreary and uneasy impression produced by an assembly of representatives
of the <i>Rhine Province</i> who wavered only between the deliberate obduracy
of privilege and the natural impotence of a half-hearted liberalism. Above
all, we cannot help noting with displeasure the almost entire absence of
general and broad points of view, as also the negligent superficiality
with which the question of a free press was debated and disposed of. Once
more, therefore, we ask ourselves whether the press was a matter too remote
from the Assembly of the Estates, and with which they had too little real
contact, for them to be able to defend freedom of the press with the thorough
and serious interest that was required?
</p>
<p>Freedom of the press presented its petition to the estates with
the <i>most subtle captatio benevolentiae.</i> <a href="#5" id="a5"><sup class="ednote">[E]</sup></a>
</p>
<p>At the very beginning of the Assembly session, a debate arose
in which the chairman pointed out that the <i>printing of the Assembly
proceedings</i>, like all other writings, was subject to <i>censorship</i>,
but that in this case <i>he</i> took the place of the censor.
</p>
<p>On this one point, did not the question of <i>freedom of the press
</i>coincide with that of <i>freedom of the Assembly?</i> The conflict
here is the more interesting because the Assembly in its own person was
given proof how the absence of freedom of the press makes all other freedoms
illusory. One form of freedom governs another just as one limb of the body
does another. Whenever a particular freedom is put in question, freedom
in general is put in question.
</p>
<p>Whenever one form of freedom is rejected, freedom in general is
rejected and henceforth can have only a semblance of existence, since the
sphere in which absence of freedom is dominant becomes a matter of pure
chance. Absence of freedom is the rule and freedom an exception, a fortuitous
and arbitrary occurrence. There can, therefore, be nothing wronger than
to think that when it is a question of a particular form of existence of
freedom, it is a particular question. It is the general question within
a particular sphere. Freedom remains freedom whether it finds expression
in printer's ink, in property, in the conscience, or in a political assembly.
But the loyal friend of freedom whose sense of honour would be offended
by the mere fact that he had to vote on the question whether <i>freedom
was to be or not to be</i> — this friend becomes perplexed when confronted
with the peculiar material form in which freedom appears. He fails to recognise
the genus in the species; because of the press, he forgets about freedom,
he believes he is judging something whose essence is alien to him, and
he condemns his own essence. Thus the Sixth Rhine Province Assembly condemned
itself by passing sentence on freedom of the press.
</p>
<p>The highly sage, practical bureaucrats who secretly and unjustifiably
think of themselves in the way that Pericles openly and rightly boasted
of himself: "I am a man who is the equal of anyone both in knowing the
needs of the state and in the art of expounding them" <a href="#6" id="a6"><sup class="ednote">[F]</sup></a>
— these hereditary
leaseholders of political intelligence will shrug their shoulders and remark
with oracular good breeding that the defenders of freedom of the press
are wasting their efforts, for a <i>mild</i> censorship is better than
a <i>harsh</i> freedom of the press. We reply to them with the words of
the Spartans Sperthias and Bulis to the Persian satrap Hydarnes:
</p>
<p class="quote">"Hydames, you have not equally weighed each side in your advice to
us. For you have tried the one which you advise, the other has remained
untried by you. You know what it means to be a slave, but you have never

Karl Marx On Freedom of the Press</p>
<h3>[Opponents of a Free Press]</h3>
<hr class="end"/>
<p>The <i>liberal opposition</i> shows us
the level of a political assembly, just as the opposition in general shows
the level of development that a society has reached. A time in which it
is philosophical audacity to doubt the existence of ghosts, in which it
is regarded as a paradox to oppose witch trials, is the time in which ghosts
and witch trials are <i>legitimate.</i> A country which, like ancient Athens,
regards lickspittles, parasites and flatterers as exceptions to the good
sense of the people, as <i>fools among the people,</i> is a country of
independence and self-reliance. But a people which, like all peoples of
the good old times, claims the right to think and utter the truth only
for <i>court-jesters, </i>can only be a people without independence or
personality. An assembly of the estates in which the opposition assures
us that freedom of the will is inherent in human nature, is at least not
an assembly in which freedom of the will prevails. The exception proves
the rule. The liberal opposition shows us what the liberal position has
become, to what extent freedom is embodied in man.
</p>
<p>Therefore, if we have remarked that the defenders of freedom of
the press in the Assembly of the Estates are by no means equal to their
task, this applies still more to the Provincial Assembly as a whole.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we begin our account of the Assembly proceedings
at this point, not merely out of a special interest in freedom of the press,
but equally out of a general interest in the Assembly. For we find the
<i>specific estate</i> spirit nowhere more clearly, decisively and fully
expressed than in the debates on the press. This holds good especially
of the <i>opposition to freedom of the press,</i> just as in general it
is in opposition to a <i>general </i>freedom that the spirit of a definite
sphere in society, the individual interest of a particular estate and its
natural one-sidedness of character are expressed most bluntly and recklessly
and, as it were, show their teeth.
</p>
<p>The debates provide us with a polemic of the princely social estate
against freedom of the press, a polemic of the knightly estate, and a polemic
of the urban estate, so that it is not the individual, but the <i>social
estate</i> that conducts the polemic. What mirror, therefore, could reflect
the inner nature of the Assembly better than the debates on the press?
</p>
<p>We begin with the <i>opponents of a free press,</i> and, as is
only fair, with a speaker from the <i>princely estate.</i>
</p>
<p>We shall not deal with the content of the first part of his speech,
to the effect "that freedom of the press and censorship are both evils,
etc.", for this theme is more thoroughly expounded by another speaker.
But we must not pass over his <i>characteristic method of argument</i>.</p>
<p class="quote">"Censorship," he said, "is a lesser evil than excesses on the part
of the press." "This conviction has gradually so taken root in our Germany"
(the question is: which part of Germany that is) "that the Federation too,
issued <i>laws</i> on the subject, which Prussia joined in approving and
observing."<a href="#1" id="a1"><sup class="ednote">[A]</sup></a></p>
<p>
The Assembly discusses liberation of the press from its bonds. These bonds
themselves, proclaims the speaker, the fetters with which the press is
shackled, prove that it is not destined for free activity. Its fettered
existence testifies against its essential nature. The laws against freedom
of the press are a refutation of freedom of the press.
</p>
<p>This is a <i>diplomatic</i> argument against all reform, one which
most decisively expresses the <i>classical theory</i> of a certain party. <a href="#2" id="a2"><sup class="ednote">[B]</sup></a></p>
<p>
Every restriction of freedom is a factual, irrefutable proof that at one
time those who held power were convinced that freedom must be restricted,
and this conviction then serves as a guiding principle for later views.
</p>
<p>People were once ordered to believe that the earth did not go
round the sun. Was Galileo refuted by this?
</p>
<p>Similarly, in our Germany legal sanction was given to the conviction
of the empire, which the individual princes shared, that serfdom was a
quality inherent in certain human beings, that truth could be made most
evident by surgical operation, we mean torture, and that the flames of
hell could already be demonstrated to heretics by means of flames on earth.
</p>
<p>Was not legal serfdom a factual proof against the rationalist
fantasy that the human body was no object for handling and possession?
Did not the primitive method of torture refute the false theory that truth
could not be extracted by opening veins, that stretching limbs on the rack
did not break down the victim's silence, that convulsions were not confessions?
</p>
<p>Thus, in the speaker's opinion, the fact of censorship refutes
freedom of the press, a statement which has its factual correctness, being
a truth of such a factual character that its magnitude can be measured
topographically, since beyond certain frontier barriers it ceases to be
factual and true.

<p class="quote">"Neither in speech nor in writing," we are further instructed, "neither
in our Rhine Province nor in Germany as a whole, are any shackles to be
seen on our true and nobler spiritual development."</p>
<p>The noble lustre of truth in our press is supposed to be a gift of the
censorship.</p>
<p>We shall first of all turn the speaker's previous argument against
himself; instead of a rational proof we shall give him an ordinance. In
the recent Prussian censorship instruction it is officially made known
that the press has hitherto been subjected to excessive restrictions, that
it has still to achieve true national content. The speaker can see that
convictions in our Germany are liable to change.</p>
<p>But what an illogical paradox to regard the censorship as a basis
for improving our press!</p>
<p>The greatest orator of the French revolution, whose <i>voix toujours
tonnante</i> <a href="#3" id="a3"><sup class="ednote">[C]</sup></a>
 still echoes in our day; the lion whose roar one must have
heard oneself in order to join with the people in calling out to him: "Well
roared, lion!" <a href="#4" id="a4"><sup class="ednote">[D]</sup></a>
 — Mirabeau — developed his talent in prison. Are prisons
on that account schools of eloquence?</p>
<p>If, despite all spiritual toll systems, the German spirit has
become capable of large-scale enterprise, it is a truly princely prejudice
to think that it is the customs barriers and cordons that have made it
so. The spiritual development of Germany has gone forward not <i>owing
to,</i> but in <i>spite of,</i> the censorship. If the press under the
censorship becomes stunted and wretched, this is put forward as an argument
against a free press although it only testifies against an unfree press.
If the press, in spite of censorship, retains its characteristic essence,
this is put forward in support of censorship although it only testifies
in favour of the spirit and not the fetters.
</p>
<p>By the way, "<i>true and nobler development</i>" is another question.
</p>
<p>In the period of strict observance of censorship from 1819 to
1830 (later, in a large part of Germany although not in "our Germany",
the censorship itself came under censorship owing to the circumstances
of the time and the unusual convictions which had been formed) our literature
experienced its "<i>Abendblatt period</i>", which can be called "true and
noble and spiritual and rich in development" with as much right as the
editor of the <i>Abendzeitung</i>, named "<i>Winkler</i>", had in humorously
adopting the pseudonym "<i>Bright</i>", although we cannot even credit
him with the brightness of a bog at midnight. This "<i>backwoodsman</i>"
, <a href="#5" id="a5"><sup class="ednote">[E]</sup></a>
 with the trade
name "Bright" is the prototype of the literature of the time, and that
Lenten period will convince posterity that if few saints could endure forty
days without food, the whole of Germany, which was not even saint-like,
managed to live over twenty years without producing or consuming spiritual
nourishment. The press had become vile, and one could only hesitate to
say whether the lack of understanding exceeded the lack of character, and
whether the absence of form exceeded the absence of content, or the reverse.
For Germany, criticism would reach its zenith if it could prove that that
period never existed. The sole literary field in which at that time the
pulse of a living spirit could still be felt, the <i>philosophical </i>field,
ceased to speak German, for German had ceased to be the language of thought.
The spirit spoke in incomprehensible mysterious words because comprehensible
words were no longer allowed to be comprehended.
</p>
<p>As far then as the example of <i>Rhenish literature</i> is concerned
— and, of course, this example rather closely concerns the Rhine Province
Assembly — one could wander through all five administrative districts
with Diogenes' lantern and nowhere would one meet "this man". We do not
regard this as a defect of the Rhine Province, but rather as a proof of
its practical and political good sense. The Rhine Province can produce
a <i>"free press",</i> but for an "<i>unfree</i>" one it lacks adroitness
and illusions.
</p>
<p>The literary period that has just ended, which we could call the
"literary period of strict censorship", is therefore clear historical proof
that the censorship has undoubtedly influenced the development of the German
spirit in a disastrous, irresponsible way, and that therefore it is by
no means destined, as the speaker imagined, to be <i>magister bonarum artium</i>. <a href="#6" id="a6"><sup class="ednote">[F]</sup></a>

Or should one understand by a "nobler and true press" one which bears its
chains with decency?
</p>
<p>If the speaker "took the liberty" of recalling "a well-known saying
about the little finger and the whole hand", we take the liberty in return
of asking whether it does not most befit the dignity of a government to
give the spirit of the people not merely one whole hand but both hands
whole?
</p>
<p>As we have seen, our speaker disposes of the relation between
censorship and spiritual development in a carelessly aristocratic, diplomatically
sober way. He represents the negative aspect of his social estate still
more resolutely in his attack on the historical <i>shaping of freedom of
the Press.</i></p>
<p>As regards freedom of the press among other nations, he says:</p>
<p class="quote">"<i>England</i> cannot serve as a measuring-rod, because, it is claimed,
centuries ago conditions were <i>historically</i> created there which could
not be brought about in any other country by the application of theories,
but which had their justification in <i>England's specific conditions</i>."</p>
<p>"In <i>Holland</i>, freedom of the press was unable to save the country
from an oppressive national debt and to a very large extent it helped to
bring about a revolution which resulted in the loss of half the country."</p>
<p>
We shall pass over France, to come back to it later.</p>
<p class="quote">"Finally, should it not be possible to find in <i>Switzerland</i> an
Eldorado blessed by freedom of the press? Does one not think with disgust
of the savage party quarrels carried on in the newspapers there, in which
the parties, with a correct sense of their small degree of human dignity,
are named after <i>parts of an animal's body</i>, being divided into <i>horn-men</i>
and <i>claw-men</i>, and have made themselves despised by all their neighbours
on account of their boorish, abusive speeches!"</p>
<p>
The <i>English</i> press, he says, is not an argument in favour of freedom
of the press in general, <i>because</i> of its <i>historical foundations</i>.
The press in England has merit <i>only</i> because it developed historically,
not as a press in general, for then, he alleges, it would have had to develop
without historical foundations. History therefore has the merit here, and
not the press. As if the press, too, were not part of history, as if the
English press under Henry VIII, the Catholic Mary, Elizabeth and James
did not have to wage a hard and often savage struggle in order to win for
the English nation its historical foundations!</p>
<p>And would it not, on the contrary, testify in favour of freedom
of the press if the English press, having the greatest freedom from restraint,
did not destructively affect the historical foundations? However, the speaker
is not consistent.</p>
<p>The English press is no proof <i>in favour</i> of the press in
general, <i>because</i> it is English. The Dutch press testifies <i>against</i>
the press in general, <i>although</i> it is only Dutch. In the one case
all the merits of the press are ascribed to the historical foundations,
in the other case all the defects of the historical foundations are ascribed
to the press. In the one case the press is not supposed to have had its
share also in historical progress, in the other case history is not supposed
to have had its share also in the defects of the press. just as the press
in England is bound up with the latter's history and specific conditions,
so also in Holland and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Is the press supposed to reflect, abolish or develop the historical
foundations? The speaker makes each into a matter of reproach for the press.
</p>
<p>He blames the <i>Dutch</i> press, <i>because of</i> its historical
development. It ought to have <i>prevented</i> the course of <i>history,
</i>it ought to have saved Holland from an <i>oppressive national debt!
</i>What an unhistorical demand! The Dutch press could not prevent the
period of Louis XIV; the Dutch press could not prevent the English navy
under Cromwell from rising to the first place in Europe; it could not cast
a spell on the ocean which would have saved Holland from the painful role
of being the arena of the warring continental powers; it was as little
able as all the censors in Germany put together to annul Napoleon's despotic
decrees.</p>
<p>But has a <i>free</i> press ever increased national debts? When,
under the regency of the Duke of Orleans, the whole of France plunged into
Law's financial lunacies, who opposed this fantastic storm and stress period
of money speculations except for a few satirists, who of course received
not banknotes but notes sending them to the Bastille.
</p>
<p>The demand that the press should be the saviour from the <i>national
debt</i>, which can be extended to say that it should also pay the debts
of individuals, reminds one of that writer who always grumbled at the doctor
because, although the latter cured his bodily ailments, he did not at the
same time correct the misprints in his writings. Freedom of the press is
as little able to promise to make a human being or a nation perfect as
the physician. It is itself no perfection. <a href="#7" id="a7"><sup class="ednote">[G]</sup></a>
 What a trivial way of behaving
it is to abuse what is good for being some specific good and not all good
at once, for being <i>this</i> particular good and <i>not some other.</i>
Of course, if freedom of the press were all in all it would make all other
functions of a nation, and the nation itself, superfluous.
</p>
<p>The speaker blames the Dutch press for the <i>Belgian revolution</i>.
</p>
<p>No one with any historical education will deny that the separation
of Belgium from Holland was an incomparably greater <i>historical event</i>
than their union. <a href="#8" id="a8"><sup class="ednote">[H]</sup></a>
</p>
<p>The press in Holland is said to have brought about the Belgian
revolution. Which press? The progressive or the reactionary? It is a question
which we can also raise in France; if the speaker blames the clerical Belgian
press, which at the same time was democratic, he should also blame the
clerical press in France, which at the same time was absolutist. Both helped
to overthrow their governments. In France it was not freedom of the press
but censorship that made for revolution.
</p>
<p>But leaving this out of account, the Belgian revolution <i>appeared</i>
at first as a spiritual revolution, as a revolution of the press. The assertion
that the press caused the Belgian revolution has no sense beyond that.
But is that a matter for blame? Must the revolution at once assume a <i>material
form</i>? Strike instead of speaking? The government can materialise a
spiritual revolution; a material revolution must first spiritualise the
government.
</p>
<p>The Belgian revolution is a product of the Belgian spirit. So
the press, too, the freest manifestation of the spirit in our day, has
its share in the Belgian revolution. The Belgian press would not have been
the Belgian press if it had stood aloof from the revolution, but equally
the Belgian revolution would not have been Belgian if it had not been at
the same time a revolution of the press. The Revolution of a people is
<i>total</i>; that is, each sphere carries it out in its own way; why not
also the press as the press?
</p>
<p>In blaming the Belgian press, therefore, the speaker is <i>blaming
Belgium</i>, not the press. It is here that we find the starting point
of his historical view of freedom of the press. The popular character of
the free press — and it is well known that even the artist does not paint
great historical pictures with water-colours — the historical individuality
of the free press, which makes it the specific expression of its specific
popular spirit, are repugnant to the speaker from the princely estate.
He demands instead that the press of the various nations should always
be a press holding his views, a press of <i>haute volée</i> <a href="#9" id="a9"><sup class="ednote">[I]</sup></a>
 and should revolve around certain individuals instead of around
the spiritual heavenly bodies, the nations. This demand stands out undisguised
in his verdict on the <i>Swiss press.</i>
</p>
<p>We permit ourselves a preliminary question. Why did the speaker
not recall that the Swiss press through Albrecht von Haller opposed the
Voltairean enlightenment? Why does he not bear in mind that even if Switzerland
is not exactly an Eldorado, nevertheless it has produced the prophet of
the future princely Eldorado, once again a certain Herr von Haller, who
in his <i>Restauration der Staatswissenschaften</i> laid the foundation
for the "nobler and true" press, for the <i>Berliner politisches Wochenblatt?
</i>By their fruits ye shall know them. And what other country in the world
could oppose to Switzerland a fruit of this luscious legitimacy?
</p>
<p>The speaker finds fault with the <i>Swiss press</i> for adopting
the "animal party names" of "horn-men and claw-men", in short because it
speaks in the <i>Swiss language</i> and to <i>Swiss people,</i> who live
in a certain patriarchal harmony with oxen and cows. <i>The press of this
country is the press of precisely this country</i>. There is nothing more
to be said about it. At the same time, however, a free press transcends
the limitations of a country's particularism, as once again the Swiss press
proves.
</p>
<p>As regards <i>animal party names</i> in particular, let us remark
that religion itself reveres the animal as a symbol of the spiritual. Our
speaker, of course, will condemn the <i>Indian</i> press, which has revered
with religious fervour Sabala the cow and Hanuman the monkey. He will reproach
the Indian press for the Indian religion, just as he does the Swiss press
for the Swiss character. But there is a press which he will hardly want
to subject to censorship; we refer to the <i>holy press,</i> the <i>Bible</i>.
Does this not divide all mankind into the two great parties of <i>sheep</i>
and <i>goats</i>? Does not God Himself describe his attitude to the houses
of Judah and Israel in the following terms: I shall be to the house of
Judah as a moth and to the house of Israel as a <i>maggot</i>. <a href="#10" id="a10"><sup class="ednote">[J]</sup></a>
 Or, what
is more familiar to us laymen, is there not a <i>princely literature</i>
which turns all anthropology into zoology? We mean the literature of <i>heraldry</i>.
That contains things still more curious than horn-men and claw-men.
</p>
<p>What, therefore, was the accusation the speaker levelled against
freedom of the press? <i>That the defects of a nation are at the same time
the defects of its press,</i> that the press is the ruthless language and
manifest image of the historical spirit of the people. Did he prove that
the <i>spirit of the German people </i>is an exception to this great natural
privilege? He showed that every nation expresses its spirit through its
press. Ought not the philosophically educated spirit of the Germans to
be entitled to what, according to the speaker's own assertion, is to be
found among the animal-fettered Swiss?
</p>
<p>Finally, does the speaker think that the <i>national</i> defects
of a free press are not just as much <i>national defects of the censors?</i>
Are the censors excluded from the historical whole? Are they unaffected
by the spirit of a time? Unfortunately, it may be so, but what man of sound
mind would not rather pardon sins of the nation and the time in the press
than sins against the nation and the time in the censorship?
</p>
<p>We remarked in the introduction that the various speakers voice
the polemic of their <i>particular estate</i> against freedom of the press.
The speaker from the princely estate put forward in the first place <i>diplomatic</i>
grounds. He proved that freedom of the press was wrong on the basis of
the <i>princely convictions</i> clearly enough expressed in the censorship
laws. He considered that the nobler and true development of the German
spirit has been <i>created</i> by the restrictions from above. Finally,
he waged a polemic <i>against the peoples</i> and with noble dread repudiated
freedom of the press as the tactless, indiscreet speech of the people addressed
to itself.

<h1>Canto The Second</h1>
<p class="skip"></p>
<p class="verse">
Oh, woe to thee, <i>Bonn</i> woe, most pious of Faculties!<br>
Put on sackcloth and ashes, pray on bended knees!<br>
Upon that Chair of erstwhile pious reputation <br>
Mad <i>Bauer </i>lectures through the Devil’s ministration. <br>
He stands and foams with rage; a demon on his back <br>
Goads him and sets him on the Theologians’ track. <br>
Just like a hydrophobic dog, he howls and bays; <br>
Through his blaspheming mouth the Adversary says:<br>
“Let not the Theologians fool you with their guiles, <br>
Or rank hypocrisy, or low, perfidious wiles.<br>
See how they twist the sense of every word by force, <br>
And slither through the darkness on their evil course. <br>
Oh, see those letter — slaves in all their filthy fright, <br>
And how they savage one another when they fight.<br>
All unctuous torture, cunning Jesuitical,<br>
All tinselled pious fraud and arts sophistical!<br>
As the schoolmaster, when the village children run<br>
Away from school to romp and have themselves some fun,<br>
Comes raging with his stick to fetch the truants in,<br>
And they, with jeers and catcalls, flee ahead of him — <br>
Such is the Theologian, very soon perplexed<br>
When trapped between the Contradictions of the Text.<br>
See how he twists, turns, dodges, stretches, wriggles in it,<br>
Forgetting everything he said that very minute.<br>
just watch him cooking in his kitchen filled with steam,<br>
Until the Contradictions flee him with a scream.<br>
How he runs after them! Oh, how he starts to scold!<br>
Will you come back againl Will you do as you're told!<br>
With what insensate rage he plies Faith’s holy cane,<br>
Hitting the godless freaks again and yet again!<br>
He pops them in the witches’ cauldron, pokes them down,<br>
Until the wretched things asphyxiate and drown!<br>
They're all the same, including these Evangelists;<br>
They'll never change as long as there are men of Christ’s.<br>
The one Evangelist misapprehends the other,<br>
He wriggles, writhes, distorts the meaning even further;<br>
Caught in the hopeless toils of endless Contradictions,<br>
He cannot help but multiply his misconstructions.<br>
He tears to shreds the writings of the other one,<br>
And then, to crown it all, there is the work of John.<br>
just look!” — The mob of Faithful, past endurance, bellows:<br>
“Away with that blasphemer, hang him on the gallows!<br>
Away! Enough abuse from that once worthy Chair,<br>
Sing Hallelujah, then, and get him out of there!”<br>
The others shout: “Hurrah, and long live Bruno Bauer<br>
Free Science’s support, Free-thinking’s mightiest power!<br>
Hush, pious hypocrites If your God’s help is strong,<br>
Then fight, and let the outcome prove you right or wrong.”<br>
“Out with the liar!” all the Right-wing voices cry.<br>
“Out with the Faithful!” comes the impious Left’s reply.<br>
“Atheists, silence!” “Pious sheep, keep your mouths shut!<br>
Or else you'll soon find out how billy-goats can butt!”<br>
“<i>Christ here!” — “</i>And Bauer here!”<br>
              Making a thund’rous sound, <br>
With all their weight the wielded sticks come crashing down <br>
To echoing battle-cries the tussle grows amain, <br>
As desks are overturned. and benches split in twain. <br>
To thwart the Christian troops, the Atheist forces bold <br>
Pile up the desks and build themselves A Safe Stronghold. <br>
United in a closely welded mass, they throw,<br>
Instead of bombs, ink-horns and Bibles at the foe.<br>
In vain the Pious launch their sallies on the fort,<br>
They fail to take it, even at the third onslaught.<br>
Heads bleed, and many fighters of the Pious band<br>
Collapse upon the bench, felled by an Atheist hand.<br>
Then the blasphemers bring the walls a-tumbling down,<br>
Lastly to drive the foe clean off the battleground.<br>
Snarling, they hurl themselves on God’s chaste warriors, who<br>
Flee in blind panic from the wild and horrid crew.<br>
Ale field is clear, at last. — <br>
              Swift speeds the pious band<br>
Along the passage to the gates, and makes its stand.<br>
The Lord sends proctors round to rescue them, and then<br>
The Rector comes, and Senators, and Clergymen.<br>
They want to mediate, ask what’s behind it all,<br>
But they themselves are soon entangled in the brawl.<br>
The fight breaks out again, all join in willy-nilly;<br>
Many a lofty learned brow is knocked half silly,<br>
Many a crooked back is beaten straight again,<br>
Many a nose pulled down that stuck up in disdain.<br>
The sky grows dark with clouds of beaten-out cloth dust,<br>
And periwigs fly at the whim of every gust.<br>
Philosophers, most Positive of gentlemen, <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume02/footnote.html#165" target=_blank>[165]</a></sup><br>
Under the Atheist attack, turn tail and run.<br>
Great <i>Fichte’s</i> little son, you certainly move fast!<br>
You're much too skinny for the Atheist repast.<br>
Herr <i>Brandis</i>, though you may he swift to flee pursuit,<br>
The system-dust has all been walloped from your suit.<br>
Refuting Hegel hasn’t done them any good,<br>
If they are beaten up by Hegel’s crazy brood.<br>
Onward they press, the frenzied Atheistic horde:<br>
Their sticks make mockery of trusting in the Lord.<br>
       But no, His eye is watchful; in the hour of need, <br>
When ignominy threatens those who hold the creed, <br>
To thwart the triumph of the evil ones down there, <br>
He sends the faithful Sack, with neatly parted hair.<br>
He comes straight from the vineyard of the Lord on High.<br>
His grey eye gleams, a star up in the Church’s sky.<br>
His nose, it is a mighty pillar of the Faith.<br>
The Lord’s Word and Salvation dribble from his mouth.<br>
His mount’s a virgin ass, with tail most wondrous fair,<br>
And if his foot trails on the ground, he doesn’t care.<br>
The Bible text he has invented, with God’s aid,<br>
And tied it with her tail on to the donkey-maid.<br>
He sits astride her, with his head bowed all the way;<br>
The Spirit gently leads the beast towards the fray.<br>
He sees the battle rage, the godless forge ahead,<br>
And seeks the pious beast on other paths to lead.<br>
But now the she-ass, who’s obeyed him faithfully,<br>
Begins to rear and stall and jump and buck and shy.<br>
“What ails you, little beast? What’s getting in your way?<br>
Go where the bridle leads you, listen, and obey!”<br>
She jams him up against a wall, unheeding still.<br>
For the first time, he tries the stick to break her will.<br>
He beats and beats and beats and beats her fit to bust.<br>
Ale she-ass won’t give in to him. He bites the dust.<br>
God opens up the donkey’s mouth; she, loud and clear,<br>
Speaks His intention for the startled <i>Sack</i> to hear.<br>
“Why do you beat me? See, the Spirit bars my way<br>
And turns my bridle towards the scene of the affray.<br>
Where’s your old courage? Up, fly to the battleground,<br>
Where Atheist fury pins God’s faithful army down.<br>
Lend me your ear, O Sack, and hear the tidings new<br>
That through your donkey’s mouth the Lord reveals to you.<br>
Henceforth your name is <i>Bag</i> and shall be <i>Sack</i> no more.<br>
I'm sending you, O <i>Bag</i>, to terminate this war.”<br>
Then did the pious <i>Bag</i> to Heaven gaze and cry:<br>
“Lord, before Thee man’s knowledge is but vanity!<br>
You choose a lowly beast for mouthpiece! Daring all,<br>
I plunge into the battle’s terrors at your call!”<br>
He turns and speeds in haste towards the scene of horrors,<br>
And finds it strewn with faint, exhausted, bleeding warriors.<br>
Then, with a mighty shout, he bravely dives into them,<br>
And to a heavenly air he sings the peace-hymn to them.<br>
His coming has the fighters dazed on either side,<br>
But <i>Brother Bag</i> just sees the Heavens open wide.<br>
“Why all this Hatred, Envy, Murder, Storm and Stress,<br>
Where Faith’s Word should resound, and hymns of holiness?<br>
In the full sight of God, where Heaven in twain divides,<br>
Have you nought else to do but tan each other’s hides?”<br>
The faithful flock gives ear and, much abashed, withdraws,<br>
The Atheist mob just stares and brazenly guffaws.<br>
Then <i>Brother Bag</i>: “Down here below is tumult, gore,<br>
But up above there’s peace and bliss for evermore.<br>
I see the Cherubim around the Almighty’s Throne,<br>
I see the Lamb of God, the sole begotten son.<br>
I see the glory of the Lord shine down so bright,<br>
I see the angelic host in songs of praise unite,<br>
I see — oh, bliss! — the Lamb of God begins to speak<br>
And states its will to me, who am its servant meek:<br>
‘I've pinned my hopes on <i>Bruno Bauer</i> all this while,<br>
But the Arch-Fiend has cheated us of him by guile.<br>
He who sat praying in his hermitage, alone,<br>
Gives sinners now my holy Word to guzzle on.<br>
He hounds my pious flock with desperate murderers.<br>
His will be done; he'll know the meaning of my curse.<br>
Be you the chosen one. Cross mountain, hill and valley,<br>
Summon the Faithful ones to arms, and do not dally.<br>
Go, let your trusty she-ass take you everywhere,<br>
Go, preach the message of the Cross, and have no fear.<br>
Put on the armour, armour of the Lord most high,<br>
Await the day of battle, for that day draws nigh.<br>
Then with the belt of Truth be sure your loins are girt;<br>
For breastplate, Righteousness shall keep you safe from hurt.<br>
With both legs booted, go you forth and do not yield,<br>
Put out the fiery darts of Hell with Faith’s bright shield.<br>
Put on Salvation’s helm that wards off mockery,<br>
God’s Word shall be your sword; wield it courageously!'<br>
Yea, Lord, I follow Thee. Thy servant flies apace <br>
To spread Thy holy Word to all the sinful race! “<br>
       Meanwhile, the pious crowd had gone to church to pray; <br>
The godless went off boozing, in the usual way.<br>
       But <i>Brother Bag</i> rode forth astride his animal,<br>
And sang: “Praise to the Lord, praise to the Lord of All,<br>
And may all folk on Earth in sweet content abide!”<br>
His pious song was heard all over, far and wide.<br>
So fared he forth and gave his animal free rein<br>
To lead him where it would in God the Father’s name.<br>
       Meanwhile, three sit in <i>Leipzig</i>. Glum and taciturn, <br>
They've long been overdue in Satan’s hell to burn. <br>
Wild <i>Ruge’s</i> one of those around the table there, <br>
His broad fists propping up a head that’s full of care. <br>
A valiant warrior, stout, seemingly hard to rattle; <br>
But sharp as rapiers are his claws, well trained in battle. <br>
He seems a philistine, beer-sodden, casual,<br>
But deep inside his breast he bears the whole of Hell.<br>
Laugh, Ruge, laugh! It’s very nearly judgment Day,<br>
And then that mask you're wearing will be torn away!<br>
The second eyes his glass with proud defiance — <i>Prutz</i><br>
The sinister, who’s hatching out infernal plots.<br>
Mere human feeling is a thing he never uses;<br>
Emotions, thoughts and deeds with him are all Medusas.<br>
Innocent, trustful hearts devoid of doubt and schism<br>
His sparkling rhymes corrupt with seeds of Atheism.<br>
Laugh, <i>Prutz</i>, oh, laugh! It’s very nearly Judgment Day<br>
And then the mask you wear, too, will be torn away.<br>
Caressing his mustachios, t ‘ he third and last<br>
Is <i>Blücher-Wigand</i>; he’s a scoundrel unsurpassed.<br>
Thanks to his capital, the whole gang’s prop is he,<br>
Untiring publisher of every blasphemy.<br>
O <i>Wigand</i> with the <i>Blücher</i> beard, laugh, laugh away! <br>
You'll surely be the Devil’s on that Judgment Day!<br>
       Fuming with rage they gaze into each other’s eyes.<br>
“Has all that money gone for nothing?” <i>Wigand</i> cries.<br>
“Have I paid out so much, and done my very best, <br>
To see the <i>Halle Annals</i> [<i>Hallische Jahrbücher für deutsche Wissenschaft und Kunst</i> ] totally suppressed?”<br>
Growls <i>Arnold Ruge</i>: “Times are anything but good. <br>
The Censor’s always out to suck my paper’s blood. <br>
At least two-thirds of all my space he has to have,<br>
Yet still they want my paper dead and in its grave!”<br>
Then <i>Prutz</i>: “Alas, six months have passed, and here we are,<br>
And still the Censor hasn’t passed a single par!<br>
Things must ease up, or else I'll starve; I'll never make it,<br>
Except by going back to love-songs — Devil take it!”<br>
“What else am I to do?” says <i>Ruge</i> with a roar.<br>
“I've got the Muses’ Almanack, [<i>Deutscher Musenalmanach</i>] and nothing more.<br>
To Hell with Hegelising, then. I'll boost morale<br>
With dreary novelettes and posies lyrical!”<br>
“I'll get in touch with him at once,” continues Wigand,<br>
“And get a new four-decker novel out of <i>Mügge.</i><br>
Come to my heart, oh, come, O sweet <i>Belles-Lettres</i>, do!<br>
The Censor cuts Hegelian sophistries, not you!<br>
My wings shall shield all German bards that care to come.<br>
Minstrels and Tavern Fiddlers, make yourselves at home!<br>
Brothers, your hands! Our line is to be different.<br>
We're loyalists from now. Long live the Government!”<br>
       The Devil walks straight in. “You wretched trash, for shame!<br>
He castigates the Free<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume02/footnote.html#164" target=_blank>[164]</a></sup> ones ‘with a tongue of flame.<br>
“You think you're heroes, while your courage quite deserts you<br>
As soon as you get banned, or when the Censor cuts you.<br>
I ought to be ashamed. I let you take me in,<br>
And never saw the Ass inside the Lion’s skin.<br>
Well, just you wait awhile. It’s going to be a pleasure<br>
To get you down in Hell and torture you at leisure.<br>
But, no, you craven trash, you're nothing but small fry!<br>
I'll chase you up to Heaven, up to the Lord on High!”<br>
“Be reasonable!” <i>Wigand</i> is constrained to say.<br>
“What, then, are we to do? Show us a better way!”<br>
“You miserable scum!” cries Satan, most displeased.<br>
“It’s plain you cannot even see the wood for trees!<br>
For if the ban on <i>Halle Annals</i> bothers you,<br>
just call them <i>German </i>[<i>Deutsche Jahrbücher für Wissenschaft und Kunst</i>], and start publishing anew.<br>
You leave the Censorship to me. The will to fight<br>
Is what you need and things will then come out all right.<br>
Who with the Devil makes a binding covenant,<br>
Must not turn tail and flee from every miscreant.<br>
Courage is all you need. Now I must onwards press.<br>
Rave on, as always, in the name of Godlessness!”<br>
       He speaks and disappears. And lo! all starry-eyed,<br>
Comes <i>Brother Bag</i> and sees the Heavens open wide.<br>
Him bears the she-ass, mouthpiece of the Almighty’s Word;<br>
She'll take him on his last ascent to meet his Lord.<br>
He looks to Heav'n with God-intoxicated eyes<br>
And says: “Blaspheming gang, I know your tricks and lies!<br>
Thus saith the Lord your God: you are the Devil’s brood,<br>
And ever seek to slake your thirst with righteous blood.<br>
Once more, then, through my servant be my summons known<br>
That you should kneel subservient before my Throne.<br>
Do penance, saith the Lord, abase yourselves and crawl,<br>
Or down to feed the flames of Hell you'll surely fall.<br>
Thus saith the Lord your God: you'll either get converted<br>
Or else I promise you I'll have you all degutted.<br>
For sweet, I'll serve this gang of evil name to you,<br>
My faithful <i>Hengstenberg</i>, and <i>Bag</i>, my servant true.<br>
Their pious flesh shall be a living grave for you.<br>
Thus saith the Lord your God.”<br>
              And therewith he withdrew.<br>

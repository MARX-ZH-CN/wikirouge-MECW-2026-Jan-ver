<p class="title"> The Insolently Threatened Yet Miraculously Rescued Bible  by Frederick Engels</p>
<h1>Canto The First</h1>
<p class="verse">
Spread out your pinions, O my soul, and humbly rise<br>
To praise in stately song Faith’s glory to the skies.<br>
Faith’s triumph — no! For am I not a broken reed?<br>
Another gives the vigour that I need:<br>
The ability, the will. O you believers, pray<br>
That gracious blessings may be showered my way.<br>
Raise a great roar, you [Heinrich] <i>Leo</i> of the Saale strands.<br>
Fold, <i>Hengstenberg</i>, your more-than-once triumphant hands.<br>
Prodigious likewise at the lectern and the lyre,<br>
Sack, lend my pen those powers of yours, lend me your fire<br>
Krummacher, man of God, rock of believers true,<br>
O guide me how to preach the Word as well as you.<br>
Dear, pious <i>Knapp</i>, your flaming brands of poetry<br>
I bear into the dark dens of iniquity.<br>
And you, that to the tribe of mockers bold and free<br>
Held out the holy Cross, O <i>Klopstock, </i>stand by me!<br>
What would I be without you, Theologian <i>John</i>!<br>
If you will help, I'll start and boldly carry on.<br>
With your assistance too, <i>David</i> and <i>Ezekiel</i>,<br>
I'll tear up by the roots all blasphemy most vile.<br>
Strong pillars of the Faith, come close and rally round,<br>
Shield me from Mockery, and Slander’s jeering sound.<br>
Lift up your pious hands towards the throne of Grace,<br>
That to God’s glory I may run my arduous race.<br>
       What suddenly disturbs the chorus of Hosannas?<br>
What’s happened to the angel hymns that fell like Manna?<br>
Woe! Has the Devil’s cunning somehow sneaked up there?<br>
Has his pestiferous stench turned joy into despair?<br>
Where only praise and jubilation should resound,<br>
What means all that distress, that sad funereal sound?<br>
Who up in highest Heaven makes that dismal moan?<br>
It is the pious souls, they are the ones that groan:<br>
       "O Lord, O hear, hear Lord, O hear our desperate cry!<br>
How long wilt Thou let Faith endure such agony?<br>
How long before Thou wilt avenge the Faithful blood<br>
So long spilt by the insulting and blaspheming brood?<br>
Oh, shall the boasts of overweening arrogance<br>
Prosper down there on Earth in all magnificence?<br>
Shall each philosopher insist that ‘I am I'?<br>
Shall the free-thinking mob Thy very Name deny?<br>
Their arrogant jeering still more wantonly resounds.<br>
O call the judgment Day, O let the Last Trump sound!”<br>
       The Lord placated them: “The measure is not full.<br>
Wait till the carrion stink blows even still more foul.<br>
My soldiers I have yet to train in verve and dash,<br>
So that they flee not Satan in the final clash.<br>
Below there in Berlin, I am indeed much sought,<br>
But others, fettered by the chains of arrogant thought, <br>
They won’t have Faith in me, they want to understand,<br>
And seek to gird me round with thought’s tight metal band.<br>
Take <i>Bruno Bauer</i>: he believes, but thinks as well;<br>
His flesh may well be willing, but his spirit’s frail.<br>
But wait awhile till all those dregs have finished sinking,<br>
And Satan after that will never catch him thinking.<br>
He'll find me in the end, if he but seeks me truly,<br>
And spurns the idle vanities he loves unduly.<br>
Thought’s folly, that has torn his senses all apart,<br>
He'll see as wind; the Light once more shall flood his heart.<br>
       Philosophy he'll deem nought but an empty fraud,<br>
       Grace shall break through. He'll know again that God is God.”<br>
Now at these words great was the Angels’ joy on high,<br>
And pious praises of the Almighty filled the sky:<br>
       "Let power and might and glory evermore redound<br>
To Thee that set the stars of Heaven whirling round.<br>
Thy wrath shall smite the wicked ones in every land,<br>
Exalting those that truly serve at Thy command.”<br>
       Then further spake the Lord: “In that last battle, he<br>
Shall lead the Faithful ones to final victory.<br>
When all the brimming vials of my wrath are shed<br>
Upon the sinful Earth, and when the seas turn red,<br>
When well-springs shoot black fountains in the deep ravine,<br>
And swarming locusts in their shimmering hosts are seen,<br>
When all Earth thunders to a clanging hail of fire,<br>
And when the ground heaves up, and cliffs are smashed entire,<br>
Then on that day shall Bruno Bauer never falter  — <br>
To raise the standard of my hosts for Throne and Altar.”<br>
       These words were greeted with felicity up there,<br>
And jubilant hymns to praise the Almighty filled the air:<br>
“Sing Hallelujah! Let the incense ever rise!”<br>
       But lo! while Heaven’s vaults ‘still echoed to the song, <br>
With stench and roaring tumult Satan swept along,<br>
Black writhing flames of Hell — rage from his eyeballs bursting,<br>
His tongue to taste the blood of God’s own children thirsting.<br>
He stepped towards the Throne on sacrilegious feet,<br>
Towards the Angels clustered round the Almighty’s Seat,<br>
Then he, in thunderous tones: “How long must you postpone, <br>
And in your cowardly peace keep me cooped up at home? <br>
Or do you simply fear that Doomsday, when we meet <br>
And battle at last is given<br>
For this world’s crown, shall signal your defeat,<br>
As I invade your tent of Heaven?<br>
But if you dare, then hurry up, give battle,<br>
And let the trumpet sound to engage.<br>
I'll muster all my savage hosts to try your mettle.<br>
Oh, how I burn to charge in the fierce war we'll wage <br>
As through your heavenly spheres I rage!”<br>
       And then the Lord: “Have patience, for the time is nigh<br>
When you shall learn indeed who is the Lord on High.<br>
Look down below on Earth. See you the portents there<br>
At which men tremble and stand deathly pale with fear?<br>
See war and revolution, pestilence and fire,<br>
Law held to scorn, religion trampled in the mire.<br>
There, blasphemy’s triumphant, mocked is piety.<br>
But wait awhile. Soon things shall ten times better be,<br>
For as my servant true I've chosen in my need<br>
One who shall preach my Kingdom to the godless breed.<br>
A target he shall be of ridicule and scorn;<br>
But that is all I need to get things quickly done.<br>
The measure’s not yet full, but very soon will be,<br>
If they still treat the light of Grace with mockery.”<br>
       The Devil: “Who’s the one that’s chosen for this feat?”<br>
The Lord: “It’s <i>Bruno Bauer</i>.”<br>
              "The Licentiate?”<br>
“The same.”<br>
       “You've picked a most unusual servant there.<br>
He gives his soul no sustenance of hymn or prayer,<br>
And he demands from you your very loveliest stars.<br>
To apprehend them — that is what he loves the best.<br>
Even the very finest speculative cores<br>
Of dogma do not help to soothe his troubled breast.”<br>
       The Lord: “Although his service may be inconsistent,<br>
I shall clear u his mind’s confusion in due season,<br>
And if in thinking he still dares to be persistent,<br>
You may be sure he'll very quickly lose his Reason.”<br>
       The Devil: “What’s the use of that? I'll lure him down.<br>
That precious stone of yours shall sparkle in my crown.<br>
And since he still has Hegel running round his brain,<br>
You watch — that’s where I'll get him by his hairy mane!”<br>
       The Lord: “Go on, then! You can have him as your<br>
Go, drag him from his Saviour. Take him far away. prize!<br>
Yes, you may catch him, if you can, with cheating lies.<br>
Laugh as you take him with you down your Hell-bound way,<br>
Then stand ashamed and make admission on your part:<br>
For all his Speculation, the believer still<br>
Sticks to the straight and narrow pathway in his heart.”<br>
       The Devil laughed. “Go on! You can’t scare me, you know!<br>
Watch out! As your man, Bauer hasn’t long to go!”<br>
Then out of Heaven with raging tempest force he broke, <br>
And left the bright domain still billowing with his smoke.<br>
       Now while the Fiend with God in business was engaged,<br>
The legions of the damned in Hell had all rebelled.<br>
An angry, howling mob, they rioted and raged,<br>
“Where are you, Satan, Satan, where are you?” they yelled.<br>
Their leader, <i>Hegel</i>, swung two torches in the air.<br>
Whirling a fiery flail, behind him came <i>Voltaire</i>.<br>
<i>Danton</i> was shouting with them, <i>Edelmann</i> was howling.<br>
“Charge, charge, you scum of Hell!” <i>Napoleon</i> was bawling.<br>
All through the gloomy pit of fire the dark shades poured,<br>
Snorting about with fury, shouting for their Lord.<br>
Then down from Heaven’s heights he plummeted amain <br>
Into his sea of fire, into his tomb of flame.<br>
“What’s this?” he roared at them. “What do you want, you rabble?<br>
You dare to mock the wrath and power of the Devil?<br>
Are you not hot enough in Hell-fire’s blazing flood?<br>
Do I not slake your thirst full well with righteous blood?”<br>
“No, no, you good-for-nothing Devil!” screamed <i>Voltaire</i>.<br>
“Have I been sowing doubt here, there, and everywhere<br>
Merely that through the whole of speculative night<br>
The word ‘philosophy’ should be decried outright,<br>
And that the French should trust their priests instead of me — <br>
And that you, Satan, you should let this come to be?”<br>
Said <i>Danton</i>: “Did I guillotine them all in vain,<br>
That Reason ousted God, but God is back again?<br>
Now nonsense reigns supreme, and high-born fops once more<br>
In league with crack-brained priests their kingdom can restore.”<br>
The furious <i>Hegel</i>, who'd been speechless all along, <br>
Forthwith rose like a giant and finally gave tongue:<br>
              "To Science I've devoted every hour, <br>
       And I've taught Atheism with all my power. <br>
       Self-consciousness upon the Throne I seated, <br>
       And thought that God had thereby been defeated.<br>
       But foolish misconception’s all that’s used me, <br>
       And certain craven minds have much abused me, <br>
       Out of pure nonsense building pseudo-structures, <br>
       Enslaving Speculation with their strictures.<br>
       At last, a truly brave man came to hand, <br>
       Strauss, who had half begun to understand. <br>
       And yet when Zurich offered him a Chair, <br>
       They simply wouldn’t let him lecture there. <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume02/footnote.html#161" target=_blank>[161]</a></sup><br>
       Shame, that the world condemns to banishment <br>
       The instrument I had the wit to invent <br>
       The freedom-fighter, bravest ever seen, <br>
       Woe, woe, I cry, they've banned my guillotine <br>
               Say, Devil, have I lived to no avail?<br>
       Is my philosophy, then, doomed to fail?<br>
       When will the right man come, and come apace,<br>
       To chop the heads off all the pious race?”<br>
<br>
The Devil heard him out, with gentle malice grinning:<br>
“Peace, most devoted servant, you can stop that whining.<br>
Do you not know your Devil, then? I have a plan.<br>
The very man has long been found. Found is the man.”<br>
“Who, who? We're all agog to know!” the rabble cried.<br>
“His name is <i>Bruno Bauer</i>,” the Arch-Fiend then replied.<br>
Howling with mirth, the sinful host all turned away,<br>
Hegel, ablaze with fury, was provoked to say:<br>
“You mock us still, you sneerer of the vilest sort!<br>
Why <i>Bruno Baer</i>, who brings Reason’s cause to nought,<br>
       And drags all Science up to trial in Faith’s High Court?”<br>
“Oh,<i> Hegel, </i>are you blind?” the Lord of Hell replied.<br>
“You think the fruits of Faith will keep him satisfied?<br>
His thirst is much too great, and they are not enough.<br>
Who fights as hard as he does, won’t run out of puff.<br>
It won’t be long before he doffs Faith’s beggar cloak,<br>
And then I'll clinch it with him at a single stroke.”<br>
Said <i>Hegel, </i>finally relieved: “I bow to you!”<br>
And all the gang of Hell roared out a wild “Halloo!”<br>
They saw their master to the door with many a joyous yell,<br>
And he, assured of triumph, floated up from Hell. — <br>
       A house of pious people and a dingy room<br>
Stacked high with books, and Bauer pondering in the gloom,<br>
The Pentateuch in front of him, the Devil behind,<br>
A tug of war twixt Faith and Doubt within his mind.<br>
“Did Moses write this book, and is it true for sure?<br>
Philosophy, your meaning is so oft obscure!<br>
I've studied matters Phenomenological, <br>
       Theological also, to my distress, <br>
       Aesthetical too, Metaphysical, Logical, <br>
       Not entirely without success.<br>
       I'm Doctor and Licentiate,<br>
       I lecture in college early and late,<br>
       I've married, by Speculation astute,<br>
       Faith and the Concept Absolute.<br>
       Nought is beyond me, no mystery<br>
       Can stand the test of my, scrutiny.<br>
Name me the dogma I haven’t been into — <br>
       Creation, Redemption, Original Sin, too.<br>
       I've grasped with absolute perfection<br>
       Even the Immaculate Conception,<br>
       Lock, stock and barrel — but all that stuff<br>
Still doesn’t prove the Pentateuch is not a bluff.<br>
       O who will help me, who will get me off the rack?<br>
O who will give the bread of knowledge that I lack? <br>
       What if that most mysterious book<br>
       Inscribed in Philip’s own true hand<br>
       Became my trusty guide and took<br>
       Me through Doubt’s ever-labyrinthine land?<br>
       I break it open. I can see the light<br>
A spring of Categories rushes into sight.<br>
       Oh, see theml Up and down they climb, <br>
       Passing gold buckets all the time!<br>
               What high ecstasy!<br>
               Faith and Science, I see,<br>
               Have signed an armistice<br>
               With sanctified kisses!<br>
       Deep under me is Nature’s mighty power!<br>
        Ah, what a sight! — but show, nothing more!<br>
       When shall the veil e'er lifted be<br>
That hides the source of the Pentateuch from me?<br>
<br>
               <i>Philip, appear</i>!”<br>
       The wall divides, and then a shadow, triple-crowned, <br>
Steps through the cleft to raise a bony warning hand:<br>
       “O Bauer, Bauer, mind you stray not from the path <br>
       That Hegel’s <i>Logic </i>has marked out for you to follow! <br>
       For, in that work, the Concept absolutely clear <br>
       Shines forth. So do not let Imaginative Thinking <br>
       Ever defy the Spirit there, which stands for Freedom.”<br>
“But can you tell me how authentic is this Book? <br>
Oh, do not turn away from me! Speak, answer, talk!”<br>
       “You're like the Spirit, that you understand, not me!"'<br>
“Not you? Oh, do not vanish! Stay with me, my friend!” <br>
He shouts, jumps up, and lo! before him stands the Fiend!<br>
       "Ha haha haha haha haha haha!<br>
       There stands the Theologian! There you are!<br>
       You thought yourself so shrewd, not even apprehending<br>
       That you were running round in circles never-ending?”<br>
Here <i>Bruno</i> reaches for his Bible, mad with fear.<br>
“Pah!” says the Devil, laughing. “That old primer there?<br>
Pah! We've left all that junk a long, long way behind,<br>
Think you that I believe such trash can ease your mind?<br>
Think you that, when within these musty walls you strain<br>
Concocting categories in your fevered brain,<br>
Or mixing Fire and Water — when you choose<br>
To try and slake the Spirit’s thirst with filthy brews,<br>
The free-willed Spirit that would burst its bonds and flee<br>
The foul confining dungeon of captivity — <br>
‘Mink you such torture can e'er satisfy your urge?<br>
Did Hegel ever teach you Hill and Vale to merge,<br>
Or Black and White, or fiercely flaming Fire and Water?<br>
Consider Hegel now, that unabashed God-hater,<br>
Who, without thinking further, flung Fact overboard<br>
And, choosing Reason, cast away Tradition’s Word.”<br>
       "O Satan, what you say indeed sounds fine — a well <br>
Of Heaven’s purest light; thus shines the smoke of Hell. <br>
But still I won’t be led astray; for Speculation <br>
Has long included you within its comprehension. <br>
And since all Being by my Spirit’s permeated, <br>
Are you alone from understanding, then, exempted? <br>
With fair appearance and dissembling words you please us: <br>
You lead us gently on, then suddenly you seize us, <br>
Pledging free Spirit for our lovely world of Fact, <br>
To lure us to that narrow realm of the Abstract. <br>
With your free Spirit to the far Extreme I'll go, <br>
Because ‘I am’ is all I claim to think and know. <br>
They don’t delude me, Friend, those stark and chilly heights, <br>
Where what the Spirit grasps, the Spirit also blights. <br>
Your Spirit is a Moloch racked with hunger’s pangs, <br>
And at the Positive it ever bares its fangs.<br>
Full well I know you and I know your ways, you see; <br>
Phrases and empty words are all you've given me. <br>
See if I positively grasp this Pentateuch,<br>
I grasp the concept ‘Judaism’ like this book.”<br>
       The Devil laughs and jeers. “How very funny! Must <br>
You try to polish up what’s old and thick with rust? <br>
How the Lord’s finger is discerned in one small louse, [Moses 8: 19]<br>
And how the Lord will guide the building of a house, [Moses 22:8]<br>
And how the Lord’s design is seen in Measure, Weight <br>
And Pledge [Moses 25] — on suchlike things you choose to speculate? <br>
You waste yourself on them, and get no joy or rest. <br>
Just try your strength with Faith, and see who comes off best! <br>
Up there, the Spirit feels its power and majesty. <br>
No more a worm that crawls through old putridity,<br>
It reigns triumphant on its throne; its high Law sees <br>
Faith, slave of Prejudice, down on its bended knees.”<br>
       "O Devil, with what case you utter all the things <br>
I've hardly dared to in my wild imaginings. <br>
Now I'm a man obsessed, a man tormented by <br>
His very inmost being’s agonising cry:<br>
‘Your life has come to nought!'”<br>
              "Don’t waste your time in vain.<br>
If the desire is there, you can be born again!”<br>
“Then where do I begin?”<br>
              "Think you that in this spot,<br>
Berlin, this true-believing, sandy vacant lot,<br>
That here you'll ever reach the lofty heights, attain the bliss<br>
Of dealing Faith once and for all the coup <i>de grâce</i>?<br>
To <i>Bonn</i> I'll take you, <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume02/footnote.html#162" target=_blank>[162]</a></sup> to the Rhine so proud and green;<br>
Of superstition’s slime you'll wash your notions clean.<br>
You'll live a life of joy and beauty all the time,<br>
Refreshed by union with the true juice of the vine;<br>
Where all is Victory, where every breast heaves high,<br>
Where every vein’s a-throb with Freedom’s radiancy!”<br>
“Lead on! I'll follow you!”<br>
              "Where in full clarity<br>
The pure Truth rises from the Spirit struggle free — <br>
There, high upon the wrecks of barriers devastated,<br>
Triumphant build a shrine to Free Thought consecrated!”<br>

<h4>[Draft]<br>
Bridlington Quay, 15 August 1881</h4>
<p class="fst">Dear Mr. Shipton,</p>
<p>I cannot make it out, how you could so strangely
misunderstand Mr Kautsky's article. <a href="#n1">[1]</a> To the first
passage you objected because State interference went against the grain
of 'many prominent men in the Unions'. Of course it does, because they
are at heart Manchester School <a href="#n2">[2]</a> men and so long as
their opinions of such are taken into account, no working-class paper is
possible. But my addition to the passage in question must have convinced
you, that the State interference here alluded to, was such, and such only,
as has been in England the Law of the Land for years: factories and workshops'
acts, <a href="#n3">[3]</a> and nothing further: things not objected to
by even your 'prominent men'.</p>
<p>As to the second passage, Mr Kautsky says: an international regulation
of the <i>war of competition is</i> as necessary as that of <i>open warfare;</i>
we demand a <i>Geneva Convention</i> <a href="#n4">[4]</a> for the workpeople
of the world. The 'Geneva Convention' is an <i>agreement</i> entered into
by the various <i>Governments</i> for the protection of wounded and ambulances
in battle. What therefore Mr Kautsky demands, is a similar agreement between
the various <i>Governments</i> for the protection of the workpeople not
of one state only, but of all, against overwork especially of women and
children. How out of that you can make an appeal to the <i>workpeople</i>
of the world to <i>meet in a Convention of delegates at Geneva</i>, I am
utterly at a loss to understand. <a href="#n5">[5]</a></p>
<p>You will own that the occurrence of such misunderstanding on your
part cannot at all encourage me to alter my resolution.</p>
<p>As to the Hirsch article, <a href="#n6">[6]</a> I do know Mr.
Eccarius and only too well for a traitor to the cause and it will be utterly
impossible for me to write for a paper which opens its columns to him.</p>
<p>Moreover, I do not see any progress. <i>The Labour Standard</i>
remains the same vehicle of the most various and mutually contradictory
views on all political and social questions which it was, perhaps unavoidably,
on the first day of its existence, but which it ought no longer to be by
this time, if there was an undercurrent among the British working class
tending towards emancipation from the liberal Capitalists. Such undercurrent
not being shown itself up to now, I must conclude it does not exist. If
there were unmistakable signs of its existence, I might make an extra effort
to assist it. But I do not think that one column a week drowned as I might
say amongst the remaining multifarious opinions represented in <i>The Labour
Standard</i> could do anything towards producing it.</p>
<p>And as I told you, I had resolved to stop writing after the Trade
Unions Congress, <a href="#n7">[7]</a> because of want of time; so whether
I write a few articles more till then, would make no difference.</p>
<p class="fst">So waiting and hoping for better times, I remain<br>
Faithfully yours,</p>
<p class="sig">F. E.</p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term">1.</span> The reference is to Karl Kautsky's article
"International Labour Laws" published anonymously in <i>The Labour Standard</i>,
No. 15, 13 August 1881.</p>
<a id="n2"></a>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">2.</span> <i>Factories and Workshops Act</i>
– Laws regulating labour conditions in British industry. The emergence
and advancement of factory legislation was a consequence of the workers'
economic and political struggle against capitalist exploitation. The first
laws adopted regulated the children’s adolescents’, and women’s labour
conditions in the textile industry (early 19th century). Step by step,
the operation of the Factories and Workshops Acts was extended to the
other industries.</p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term">3.</span> The <i>Geneva Convention</i> of the
Red Cross of 1864 – An international document signed at the conference
of 16 European states in Geneva. The Geneva Convention established principles
for belligerents’ treatment of the wounded and the sick, and granted the
right of neutrality to the medical personnel taking care of the wounded
men.</p>

"A German Opinion of English Trade Unionism." Eccarius regarded highly
the German trade unions founded in 1868 by Max Hirsch and Franz Duncker
(the so-called Hirsch-Duncker trade unions).</p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term">5.</span> In Engels' draft manuscript the following
passage is crossed out here: 'If you had understood the drift of the article,
you must have at once seen that here was a measure of an immediately practical
nature, so easy of execution that one of the existing governments of Europe
(the Swiss Government) had been induced to take it in hand, that the proposal
to equalize the hours of labour in all manufacturing countries by making
factory and workshop's legislation a matter of international state agreement,
was one of the greatest immediate interest to the working people. Especially
to those of England who, besides the Swiss, are the best protected of all
against overworking and therefore are exposed to an unfair competition
on the part of Belgian, French and German workpeople whose hours of work
are much longer.</p>

The English middle-class Press has lately been
very silent about the atrocities committed by Bismarck and his understrappers
against the members of the Social-Democratic Working Men’s Party in Germany.
The only exception, to some extent, has been the <i>Daily News.</i> Formerly,
when despotic Governments abroad indulged in such vagaries at the expense
of their subjects, the outcry was great indeed in the English dailies and
weeklies. But here the oppressed parties are working men, and proud of
the name, and the Press representatives of “Society,” of the “Upper Ten,"
suppress the facts and almost seem, by the obstinacy of their silence,
to approve of them. What business, indeed, have working men with politics?
Leave that to their “betters!” And then there is this other reason for
the silence of the English Press: It is very hard to attack Bismarck’s
Coercion Act <a href="#n1">[1]</a> and the way he carries it out, and in
the same breath to defend Mr. Forster’s coercion proceedings in Ireland.
<a href="#n2">[2]</a> This is a very sore point, and must not be touched.
The middle-class Press can scarcely be expected to point out itself how
much the moral position of England in Europe and America has been lowered
by the present Government’s action in Ireland.</p>
<p>At every general election the German Working Men’s party turned
up with rapidly-increasing numbers; at the last but one above 500,000;
at the last one more than 600,000 votes fell to their candidates. <a href="#n3">[3]</a>
Berlin elected two, Elberfeld-Barmen, one Breslau, Dresden, one each; ten
seats were conquered in the face of the coalition of the Government with
the whole of the Liberal, Conservative, and Catholic parties, in the face
of the outcry created by the two attempts at shooting the Emperor, 
<a href="#n4" id="ireland">[4]</a>
which all other parties agreed to make the Working Men’s party responsible
for. Then Bismarck succeeded in passing an Act by which Social-Democracy
was outlawed. The Working Men’s newspapers more than fifty, were suppressed,
their societies and clubs broken up, their funds seized, their meetings
dissolved by the police, and, to crown all, it was enacted that whole towns
and districts might be “proclaimed", just as in Ireland. But what even
English Coercion Bills <a href="#n5">[5]</a> have never ventured upon in
Ireland Bismarck did in Germany. In every “proclaimed” district the police
received the right to expel any man whom it might “reasonably suspect"
of Socialistic propaganda. Berlin was, of course, at once proclaimed, and
hundreds (with their families, thousands) of people were expelled. For
the Prussian police always expel men with families; the young unmarried
men are generally let alone; to them expulsion would be no great punishment,
but to the heads of families it means, in most cases, a long career of
misery if not absolute ruin. Then Hamburg elected a working man member
of Parliament, <a href="#n6">[6]</a> and was immediately proclaimed. The
first batch of men expelled from Hamburg was about a hundred, with families
amounting, besides, to more than three hundred. The Working Men’s party,
within two days, found the means to provide for their travelling expenses
and other immediate wants. Now Leipzig has also been proclaimed, <a href="#n7">[7]</a>
and without any other pretext but that otherwise the Government cannot
break up the organisation of the party. The expulsions of the very first
day number thirty-three, mostly married men with families. Three members
of the German Parliament head the list; perhaps Mr. Dillon will send them
a letter of congratulation, considering that they are not yet quite so
badly off as himself. <a href="#n8">[8]</a></p>
<p>But this is not all. The Working Men’s party once being outlawed
in due form, and deprived of all those political rights which other Germans
are supposed to enjoy, the police can do with the individual members of
that party just as they like. Under the pretext of searching for forbidden
publications, their wives and daughters are subjected to the most indecent
and brutal treatment. They themselves are arrested whenever it pleases
the police, are remanded from week to week, and discharged only after having
passed some months in prison. New offences, unknown to the criminal code,
are invented by the police, and that code stretched beyond all possibility.
And often enough the police finds magistrates and judges corrupt or fanatical
enough to aid and abet them; promotion is at this price! What this all
comes to the following astounding figures will show. In the year from October,
1879, to October, 1880, there were in Prussia alone imprisoned for high
treason, treason felony, insulting the Emperor, etc., not less than 1,108
persons; and for political libels, insulting Bismarck, or defiling the
Government, etc., not less than 10,094 persons. Eleven thousand two hundred
and two political prisoners, that beats even Mr. Forster’s Irish exploits!</p>
<p>And what has Bismarck attained with all his coercion? Just as
much as Mr. Forster in Ireland. The Social-Democratic party is in as blooming
a condition, and possesses as firm an organisation, as the Irish Land League.
<a href="#n9">[9]</a> A few days ago there were elections for the Town
Council of Mannheim. The working-class party nominated sixteen candidates,
and carried them all by a majority of nearly three to one. Again, Bebel,
member of the German Parliament for Dresden, stood for the representation
of the Leipzig district in the Saxon Parliament. Bebel is himself a working
man (a turner), and one of the best, if not the best speaker in Germany.
To frustrate his being elected, the Government expelled all his committee.
What was the result? That even with a limited suffrage, Bebel was carried
by a strong majority. Thus, Bismarck’s coercion avails him nothing; on
the contrary, it exasperates the people. Those to whom all legal means
of asserting themselves are cut off, will one fine morning take to illegal
ones, and no one can blame them. How often have Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Forster
proclaimed that doctrine? And how do they act now in Ireland?</p>
<h3>Notes<br>
<i>From the MECW</i></h3>
<p class="information"><a id="n1"></a><span class="term">1</span> The <i>Exceptional Law against the Socialists</i>
(Gezetz gegen die gemeinefährlichen Bestrebungen der Sozialdemokratie
– The Law against the Harmful and Dangerous Aspirations of Social-Democracy)
was introduced by the Bismarck government, supported by the majority in
the Reichstag, on October 21 1878 to counter the socialist and workers’
movement. This law, better known as the Anti-Socialist Law, made the Social-Democratic
Party of Germany illegal, banned all party and mass workers’ organizations,
and the socialist and workers’ press; on the basis of this law, socialist
literature was confiscated and Social-Democrats subjected to reprisals.
However, during its operation, the Social-Democratic Party, assisted by
Marx and Engels, uprooted both opportunist and “ultra-Left” elements and
managed to substantially strengthen and widen its influence among the people
by skilfully combining illegal and legal methods of work. Under pressure
from the mass workers’ movement, the Anti-Socialist Law was abrogated on
October 1 1890.</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n2"></a><span class="term">2</span> The introduction of the Land Bill
met with resistance on the part of the Irish tenants. Using the <i>Coercion
Act</i> passed in March 1881, Chief Secretary for Ireland Forster applied
extraordinary measures by sending troops to Ireland to evict the tenants
who refused to pay the rent.</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n3"></a><span class="term">3</span> The reference is to the elections
to the Reichstag of January 10, 1877 and July 30, 1878.</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n4"></a><span class="term">4</span> The reference is to the assassination
attempt on William I made on May 11 1878 by tinner Emil Hödel, who
had been earlier expelled from the Leipzig Social-Democratic Association,
and to that of June 2 made by the German anarchist Karl Eduard Nobiling,
who had never been a member of the German Social-Democratic Workers’ Party.
These events gave rise to a vicious campaign against the socialists and
were an excuse for the promulgation of the Anti-Socialist Law in October
1878.</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n5"></a><span class="term">5</span> <i>Coercion Bills</i> were passed
by the British Parliament several times throughout the 19th century with
a view to suppressing the revolutionary and national liberation movement
in Ireland. Under them a state of siege was declared on Irish territory,
and the English authorities were granted extraordinary powers.</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n6"></a><span class="term">6</span> On April 27, 1880 Georg Wilhelm Hartmann
won the mandate at the supplementary elections to the Reichstag in the
second district of Hamburg. From September 9, 1879 to June 15, 1881, the
deputies to the Reichstag from the Social-Democratic faction were: August
Bebel, Wilhelm Bracke, Friedrich Wilhelm Fritzsche, Wilhelm Hasselmann,
Max Kayser, Wilhelm Liebknecht, Klaus Peter Reinders, Julius Vahlteich
and Philipp Wiemer. After the death of Bracke and Reinders, their seats
were filled by Ignaz Auer and Wilhelm Hasenclever.</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n7"></a><span class="term">7</span> A minor state of siege was declared
in Leipzig on June 27, 1881. Earlier, it had been introduced in Berlin
and on October 28, 1880, in Hamburg-Altona and the environs.</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n8"></a><span class="term">8</span> Using the Coercion Act, in May-October
1881 the English authorities arrested prominent Irish deputies, members
of the Irish National Land League headed by Charles Parnell, who opposed
the introduction of the Land Bill of 1881. Among the prisoners was John
Dillon, an Irish political leader, member of the British Parliament, one
of the League’s leaders.</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n9"></a><span class="term">9</span> The <i>Irish National Land League
–</i> a mass organisation founded in 1879 by the petty-bourgeois democrat
Michael Davitt. The League united large sections of the Irish peasantry
and the urban poor, and was supported by the progressive section of the
Irish bourgeoisie. Its agrarian demands mirrored the spontaneous protest
of the Irish masses against the landlords’ and national oppression. However,
some of the League’s leaders adopted an inconsistent stand, and this was
used by bourgeois nationalists (Parnell and others), who sought to reduce
the activity of the League to the campaign for Home Rule, i.e. for the
granting to Ireland of limited self-government within the framework of
the British Empire. They did not advocate the abolition of English landlordism,
a demand advanced by the revolutionary democrats. In 1881 the Land League
was banned, but in actual fact it continued its activity until the late
1880s.</p>

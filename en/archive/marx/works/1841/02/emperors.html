<p class="verse">Paris is empty. All the populace<br>
Swarms out to throng the Seine on either side. <br>
Bright shines the sun of France, though veiled in mourning.<br>
A tear bedews the smiling face of pride.</p>
<p class="verse">Today the ebullient French are grave and calm.<br>
They dream of victory’s laurel wreath no more.<br>
Ringed with eternal laurels comes the scourge<br>
Of Europe, God of France, the Emperor.</p>
<p class="verse">like grey old battle ruins, the veteran soldiers <br>
Ride on before and after. The funeral train <br>
With cannon thundering and banners flying <br>
Moves on towards Paris. Rich, exuberant, vain,</p>
<p class="verse">Plunged into grief, devotion-drunk once more, <br>
Paris falls prostrate at her idol’s feet;<br>
And if the price be still more suffering — <br>
They shall not flinch. Thoughts of revenge are sweet.</p>
<p class="verse">Music of death and music of the wars<br>
Crashes all round. The gentlest heart is thrilled.<br>
Thus rode he in the blaze of victory<br>
From Austerlitz and from Marengo’s field.</p>
<p class="verse">And pale, and mute, and proud, and great, as when <br>
He rode in triumph through the swirling throng,<br>
Transformed as never by the light of glory,<br>
Acclaimed by all, the Emperor rides along.</p>
<p class="verse">Where are they now, the Guards? Where is Dombrowski,<br>
General of the Slays and no man’s slave?<br>
Murat, the prince of horsemen? Poniatowski?<br>
And where is Ney, the Bravest of the Brave?</p>
<p class="verse">Thinned is the forest of the mighty heroes.<br>
Waterloo’s fury mowed the Guardsmen down.<br>
The remnants march in silence, heads held high.<br>
Behind iron bars weeps Montholon, alone.</p>
<p class="verse">The strength and flower of Empire follow after.<br>
United here the young and old of France.<br>
And even the elite of the Republic<br>
Weep at the shrine where weeps the whole of France.</p>
<p class="verse">And who are these with brows of victory<br>
That yet betray the anguish of their souls,<br>
Their features ravaged by the grief of mourning,<br>
Though they step proudly? Hush, it is the Poles.</p>
<p class="verse">To greet the Emperor — arches, columns, stones,<br>
Memorials, images of eternity,<br>
Ideas in bronze as daring as his own,<br>
To sanctify his fallen majesty.</p>
<p class="verse">Collapsed his house, tumbled the royal crown,<br>
Gone is the world empire that he dreamed might be.<br>
Like Alexander, without heirs he sleeps<br>
The eternal sleep beneath the laurel-tree.</p>
<p class="verse">He rests in peace, Silent the <i>Te Deum</i>.<br>
In pious gloom the shadowed columns rear.<br>
This very church is now his mausoleum.<br>
A deity lies dead and buried here.</p>

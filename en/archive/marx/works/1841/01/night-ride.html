<h1>Night Ride</h1>
<hr class="end"/><p class="information"><span class="info">Written</span>: at the end of 1840<br>

<p class="verse">One night, my carriage bore me all alone<br>
Across that well-known German territory<br>
Where many a heart, by power beaten down,<br>
Rages in impotent and blazing fury.</p>
<p class="verse">In fury that the freedom bought so dear<br>
With struggle and with ceaseless vigilance<br>
Had been cast out, for venal tongues to jeer<br>
And cavil at with cruel insolence.</p>
<p class="verse">A mist lay on the meadows, deep and calm.<br>
At times, a gust of wind would smite amain<br>
The poplar-trees and they, in quick alarm<br>
Aroused from sleep, soon slumbered on again.</p>
<p class="verse">Clear was the air. Sharp hung the sickle moon, <br>
A sword of Damocles above the town<br>
Towards which I sped. <br>
The wrath of kings flies soon <br>
From far away to strike its victims down.</p>
<p class="verse">Around the carriage wheels run leaping packs <br>
Of dogs that bark at me. <br>
And do they howl just like the Capital’s paid writer-hacks, <br>
Having caught wind of my free-thinking soul?</p>
<p class="verse">What do I care? Sunk in my cushions low,<br>
I live in dreams of many brave tomorrows.<br>
Make no mistake — just before dawn, we know,<br>
The nightmare plumbs the deepest of its horrors.</p>
<p class="verse">Yes, morning comes at last in silence stealing.<br>
A single star shines forth to light its way.<br>
The pious wake to bells of freedom pealing — <br>
No tocsin now, but peace this joyful day!</p>
<p class="verse">The spirit’s tree has coiled its root-limbs round<br>
The past, to crush all things outworn and old,<br>
And now its branches strew the world around<br>
With shining blossoms of eternal gold!</p>
<p class="verse">And so I slept, and woke that morning after,<br>
And saw the earth all happy, cleansed and bright,<br>
And <i>Stüve’s</i> city [Osnabrack, whose burgomaster was Johann Karl Bertram Stüve ]filled with joy and laughter,<br>
City of Freedom, bathed in morning light.</p>

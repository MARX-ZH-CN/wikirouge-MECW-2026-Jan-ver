The treatise that I herewith submit to the public is an old piece of work and was originally intended as part of a comprehensive exposition of Epicurean, Stoic, and Sceptic philosophy. At present, however, political and philosophical arrangements of an entirely different kind prevent me from bringing such a task to completion.</p>
<p>
Only now the time has come in which the systems of the Epicureans, Stoics and Sceptics can be understood.  They are the <i>philosophers of </i>self<i>-consciousness.  </i>These lines will at any rate show how little has so far been achieved towards solving the problem.</p>

<h3>
Chapter Two: The Qualities of the Atom 
</h3>
<hr class="end"/>
<p class="skip"> </p>
<p class="fst">
It contradicts the concept of the atom that the atom should have properties, because, as Epicurus says, every property is variable but the atoms do not change.<sup class="anote"><a href="#1" id="1b">(1)</a></sup> Nevertheless it is a <i>necessary consequence</i> to attribute properties to atoms.  Indeed, the many atoms of repulsion separated by sensuous space must necessarily be <i>immediately different from one another</i> and <i>from their pure</i> <i>essence,</i> i.e., they must possess qualities.</p>
<p>
In the following analysis I therefore take no account of the assertion made by <i>Schneider</i> and <i>Nürnberger</i> that “Epicurus attributed no qualities to the atoms, paragraphs 44 and 54 of the letter to Herodotus in Diogenes Laertius have been interpolated”.  If this were truly so, how is one to invalidate the evidence of Lucretius, Plutarch, and indeed of all other authors who speak of Epicurus?  Moreover, Diogenes Laertius mentions the qualities of the atom not in two, but in ten paragraphs: Nos. 42, 43, 44, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 and 61.  The grounds these critics give for their contention — that “they did not know how to reconcile the qualities of the atom with its concept"-are very shallow.” <sup class="ednote"><a href="../../cw/volume01/footnote.htm#" id="25a">[25]</a></sup> <i>Spinoza</i> says that ignorance is no argument. [Spinoza, <i>Ethics</i>, Part I, Prop. 36, Appendix] If one was to delete the passages in the ancients which he does not understand, how quickly would we have a <i>tabula rasa</i>!</p>
<p>
Through the qualities the atom acquires an existence which contradicts its concept; it is assumed as an <i>externalised being different</i> from <i>its essence.  </i>It is this contradiction which mainly interests Epicurus.  Hence, as soon as he posits a property and thus draws the consequence of the material nature of the atom, he counterposits at the same time determinations which again destroy this property in its own sphere and validate instead the concept of the atom.  <i>He therefore determines all properties in such a way that they contradict themselves</i>.  Democritus, on the other hand, nowhere considers the properties in relation to the atom itself, nor does he objectify the contradiction between concept and existence which is inherent in them.  His whole interest lies rather in representing the qualities in relation to concrete nature, which is to be formed out of them.  To him they are merely hypotheses to explain the plurality . which makes its appearance.  It follows that the concept of the atom has nothing to do with them.</p>
<p>
In order to prove our assertion it is first of all necessary to elucidate the sources which here seem to contradict one another.</p>
<p>
In the treatise <i>De placitis philosophorum</i> we read:</p>
<p class="quoteb">
“<i>Epicurus</i> asserts that the atoms have three qualities: size, shape, weight.  Democritus only assumed two: size and shape.  Epicurus added weight as the third."<sup class="anote"><a href="#2" id="2b">(2)</a></sup></p>
<p class="fst">
The same passage is repeated word for word in the <i>Praeparatio evangelica of Eusebius</i>.<sup class="anote"><a href="#3" id="3b">(3)</a></sup></p>
<p>
It is confirmed by the testimony of Simplicius<sup class="anote"><a href="#4" id="4b">(4)</a></sup> and Philoponus,<sup class="anote"><a href="#5" id="5b">(5)</a></sup> according to whom Democritus attributed to the atoms only difference in size and shape.  Directly contrary stands Aristotle who, in the book De generations et corruptions, attributes to the atoms of Democritus difference in weight.<sup class="anote"><a href="#6" id="6b">(6)</a></sup> In another passage (in the first book of <i>De caelo</i>) <i>Aristotle </i>leaves undecided the question of whether or not Democritus ascribed weight to the atoms, for he says:</p>
<p class="quoteb">
"Thus none of the bodies will be absolutely light if they all have weight; but if all have lightness, none will be heavy."<sup class="anote"><a href="#7" id="7b">(7)</a></sup></p>
<p class="fst">
In his <i>Geschichte der alten Philosophie, Ritter</i>, basing himself on the authority of Aristotle, rejects the assertions of Plutarch, Eusebius and Stobaeus.<sup class="anote"><a href="#8" id="8b">(8)</a></sup> He does not consider the testimony of Simplicius and Philoponus.</p>
<p>
Let us see whether these passages are really so contradictory.  In the passage cited, Aristotle does not speak of the qualities of the atom <i>ex professo.</i>[as someone who knows their profession]<i> </i>On the other hand, we read in the eighth book of the <i>Metaphysics</i>:</p>
<p class="quoteb">
"Democritus assumes three differences between atoms. For the underlying body is one and the same with respect to matter, but it differs in <i>rhysmos</i>, meaning shape, in <i>trope</i>, meaning position, or in <i>diathige</i>, meaning arrangement."<sup class="anote"><a href="#9" id="9b">(9)</a></sup></p>
<p class="fst">
This much can be immediately concluded from this passage <!--[<STRIKE>Democritus does not posit the <difference> contradiction between the quality of the atom and its concept</STRIKE>]-->. Weight is not mentioned as a property of the Democritean atoms.  The fragmented pieces of matter, kept apart by the void, must have special forms, and these are quite externally perceived from the observation of space.  This emerges even more clearly from the following passage of Aristotle:</p>
<p class="quoteb">
"Leucippus and his companion Democritus hold that the elements are the full and the void.... These are the basis of being as matter. just as those who assume only one fundamental substance generate all other things by its affections, assuming rarity and density as the principles of qualities-in the same way Leucippus and Democritus also teach that the differences between the atoms are the causes of the other things, for the underlying being differs only by <i>rhysmos</i>, <i>diathige</i> and <i>trope</i> .... That is, A differs from N in shape, AN from NA in arrangement, Z from N in position.”<sup class="anote"><a href="#10" id="10b">(10)</a></sup></p>
<p class="fst">
It is evident from this quotation that Democritus considers the properties of the atom only in relation to the formation of the differences in the world of appearances, and not in relation to the atom itself. it follows further that Democritus does not single out weight as an essential property of the atoms.  For him weight is taken for granted, since everything corporeal has weight.  In the same way, according to him, even size is not a basic quality.  It is an accidental determination which is already given to the atoms together with figure.  Only the diversity of the figures is of interest to Democritus, since nothing more is contained in shape, position and arrangement.  Size, shape and weight, by being combined as they are by Epicurus, are differences which the atom in itself possesses.  Shape, position and arrangement are differences which the atom possesses in relation to something else.  Whereas we find in Democritus mere hypothetical determinations to explain the world of appearances, in Epicurus the consequence of the principle itself will be presented to us.  We shall therefore discuss in detail his determinations of the properties of the atom.</p>
<p>
<i>First of all</i>, the atoms have size.<sup class="anote"><a href="#11" id="11b">(11)</a></sup> And then again, size is also negated.  That is to say, they do not have <i>every</i> size;<sup class="anote"><a href="#12" id="12b">(12)</a></sup> but only some differences in size among them must be admitted.<sup class="anote"><a href="#13" id="13b">(13)</a></sup> Indeed, only the negation of the large can be ascribed to them, the small,<sup class="anote"><a href="#14" id="14b">(14)</a></sup> — also not the minimum, for this would be merely a spatial determination, but the infinitely small, which expresses the contradiction.<sup class="anote"><a href="#15" id="15b">(15)</a></sup> Rosinius, in his notes on the fragments of Epicurus; therefore translates one passage incorrectly and completely ignores the other, when he says:</p>
<p class="quoteb">
“In this way Epicurus tried to make plausible the tenuity of the atoms of incredible smallness, by saying, according to Laertius, X, 44, that they have no size.”<sup class="anote"><a href="#16" id="16b">(16)</a></sup></p>
<p class="fst">
Now I shall not concern myself with the fact that, according to <i>Eusebius</i>, Epicurus was the first to ascribe infinite smallness to the atoms,<sup class="anote"><a href="#17" id="17b">(17)</a></sup> whereas Democritus also assumed atoms of the largest size — <i>Stobaeus</i> says even as large as the world.<sup class="anote"><a href="#18" id="18b">(18)</a></sup></p>
<p>
This, on the one hand, contradicts the testimony of <i>Aristotle</i>.<sup class="anote"><a href="#19" id="19b">(19)</a></sup> On the other hand, Eusebius, or rather the Alexandrian bishop <i>Dionysius</i>, from whom he takes excerpts, contradicts himself; for in the same book we read that Democritus assumed as the principles of nature indivisible bodies perceptible through reason.<sup class="anote"><a href="#20" id="20b">(20)</a></sup> This much at least is clear: Democritus was not aware of the contradiction; he did not pay attention to it, whereas it was the chief interest of Epicurus.</p>
<p>
The <i>second</i> property of the Epicurean atoms is <i>shape</i>.<sup class="anote"><a href="#21" id="21b">(21)</a></sup> But this determination also contradicts the concept of the atom, and its opposite must be assumed.  Abstract individuality is abstract identity-to-itself and therefore without shape.  The differences in the shape of the atoms cannot, therefore, be determined<sup class="anote"><a href="#22" id="22b">(22)</a></sup> although they are not absolutely infinite.<sup class="anote"><a href="#23" id="23b">(23)</a></sup> It is rather by a definite and finite number of shapes that the atoms are differentiated from one another.<sup class="anote"><a href="#24" id="24b">(24)</a></sup> From this it is obvious that there are not as many different figures as there are atoms,<sup class="anote"><a href="#25" id="25b">(25)</a></sup> while Democritus assumes an infinite number of figures.<sup class="anote"><a href="#26" id="26b">(26)</a></sup> If every atom had a particular shape, then there would have to be atoms of infinite — <i>size</i><sup class="anote"><a href="#27" id="27b">(27)</a></sup>; for they would have an infinite difference, the difference from all the others, in themselves [<i>an sich</i>], like the monads of Leibniz.  This leads to the inversion of Leibniz's assertion that no two things are identical, and there are infinitely many atoms of the same shape.  This obviously negates again the determination of the shape, because a shape which no longer differs from another is not shape. <sup class="anote"><a href="#28" id="28b">(28)</a></sup> <!--Epicurus therefore has here also objectified the contradiction, whole Democritus, only considering the material side, does not show in the further determination any consequence of the principle--></p>
<p>
Finally, it is highly important that Epicurus makes <i>weight </i>the third quality,<sup class="anote"><a href="#29" id="29b">(29)</a></sup> for in the centre of gravity matter possesses the ideal individuality which forms a principal determination of the atom.  Hence, once the atoms are brought into the realm of presentation, they must also have weight.</p>
<p>
But weight also directly contradicts the concept of the atom, because it is the individuality of matter as an ideal point which lies outside matter.  But the atom is itself this individuality, as it were the centre of gravity presented as an individual existence.  Weight therefore exists for Epicurus only as <i>different weight, </i>and the atoms are themselves substantial <i>centres of </i>gravity like the heavenly bodies.  If this is applied to the concrete, then the obvious result is the fact which old <i>Brucker</i> finds so amazing<sup class="anote"><a href="#30" id="30b">(30)</a></sup> and of which Lucretius assures us, <sup class="anote"><a href="#31" id="31b">(31)</a></sup> namely, that the earth has no centre towards which everything strives, and that there are no antipodes.  Furthermore since weight belongs only to that atom which is different from the other, hence externalised and endowed with properties, then it is clear that where the atoms are not thought of as many in their differentiation from one another, but only in relation to the void, the determination of weight ceases to exist.  The atoms, as different as they may be in mass and shape, move therefore with equal speed in empty space.<sup class="anote"><a href="#32" id="32b">(32)</a></sup> Epicurus thus applies weight only in regard to repulsion and the resulting compositions.  This has led to the assertions that only the conglomerations of the atoms are endowed with weight, but not the atoms themselves.<sup class="anote"><a href="#33" id="33b">(33)</a></sup></p>
<p>
Gassendi already praises Epicurus because, led purely by reason, he anticipated the experimentally demonstrated fact that all bodies, although very different in weight and mass, have the same velocity when they fall from above to below.<sup class="anote"><a href="#34" id="34b">(34)</a></sup> <!--We have added to this praise the explanation of the principle of Epicurus.--></p>
<p>
The consideration of the properties of the atoms leads us therefore to the same result as the consideration of the declination, namely, that Epicurus objectifies the contradiction in the concept of the atom between essence and existence.  He thus gave us the science of atomistics.  In Democritus, on the other hand, there is no realisation of the principle itself.  He only maintains the material side and offers hypotheses for the benefit of empirical observation.</p>

<sup class="anote"><a href="#9b">(9)</a></sup> Aristotle, <i>Metaphysics</i>, VIII, 2 [1042, 11-141.

<sup class="anote"><a href="#10b">(10)</a></sup> Ibid., I, 4 [985b, 4-191.  Leucippus and his associate Democritus say that the full and the empty are the elements, calling the one being and the other non-being-the full and solid being being, the empty non-being (whence they say being no more is than non-being, because the solid no more is than the empty); and they make these the material causes of things.  And as those who make the underlying substance one generate all other things by its modifications, supposing the rare and the dense to be the sources of modifications, in the same way these philosophers say the differences in the elements are the causes of all other qualities.  These differences, they say, are three-shape and order and position.  For they say the real is differentiated only by “rhythm” and “inter-contact” and “turning”; and of these rhythm is shape, inter-contact is order, and turning is position; for A differs from N in shape, AN from NA in order, and Z from, N in position.</p>

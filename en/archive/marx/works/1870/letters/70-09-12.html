<h4>September 12, 1870</h4>
<p class="fst">
If anything at all could be done in Paris, a rising of the workers before peace is concluded should be prevented. <a href="../../../../../glossary/people/b/i.html#bismarck" target=_blank>Bismarck</a> will soon be in a position to make peace, either by taking Paris or because the European situation obliges him to put an end to the war.  However the peace may turn out,
it must be concluded before the workers can do anything at all. If they were victorious now--in the service of national defence--they would have to inherit the legacy of <a href="../../../../../glossary/people/b/o.html#bonaparte" target=_blank>Bonaparte</a> and of the present lousy Republic, and would be needlessly crushed by the German armies and thrown back another twenty years. They themselves can lose nothing by waiting. The possible changes of frontier are in any case only provisional and will be reversed again. To fight for the bourgeoisie against the Prussians would be madness. Whatever the government may be which concludes peace, the fact that it has done so will eventually make its existence impossible, and in internal conflicts there will not be much to fear from the army, returned home after imprisonment. After the peace all the chances will be more favourable to the workers than they ever were before. But will they not let themselves be carried away again under the pressure of the external attack, and proclaim the Social Republic on the eve of the storming of Paris? It would be appalling if as their last act of war the German armies had to fight out a battle with the Parisian workers at the barricades. It would throw us back fifty years and delay everything so much that everybody and everything would get into a false position--and the national hatred and the domination by phrases which would <i>then</i> arise among the French workers!</p>
<p>
It is a damnably bad thing that in the present situation there are so few people in Paris who are ready to dare to see things as they <i>really are.</i>  Where is one man there who even dares to <i>think</i> that France's active power of resistance is broken where this war is concerned, and that with it the prospects of repelling the invasion by a revolution fall to the ground too! Just because people do not <i>want</i> to hear the real truth I am afraid that things may still come to this.  For the apathy of the workers <i>before</i> the fall of the Empire will no doubt have changed by now.</p>

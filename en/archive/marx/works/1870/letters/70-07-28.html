<p>... Last Tuesday the General Council ordered a thousand copies of the Address <sup class="enote"><a href="#n1">[1]</a></sup> to be printed. Today I expect the proof-sheets.</p>
<p>The singing of the <i>Marseillaise </i>in France is a parody just like all the Second Empire. But that scoundrel <sup class="enote"><a href="#n2">[2]</a></sup> at least feels that ‘Going off to Syria’ <sup class="enote"><a href="#n3">[3]</a></sup> would not do. In Prussia, on the other hand, such buffoonery is not necessary. ‘Lord, in Thee is all my trust!’, sung by William I, with Bismarck on the right and Stieber <sup class="enote"><a href="#n4">[4]</a></sup> on the left, is the German <i>Marseillaise</i>. Like in 1812 seqq, the German philistine seems to be really delighted because he can now give free vent to his innate servility. Who would have thought it possible that twenty-two years after 1848 a national war in Germany would be given <i>such </i>theoretical expression!</p>
<p>It is fortunate that this whole demonstration originated with the middle class. The working class, with the exception of the direct adherents of Schweitzer, <sup class="enote"><a href="#n5">[5]</a></sup> takes no part in it. The war of classes in both countries, France and Germany, has fortunately reached such an extent that no war abroad can seriously turn back the wheels of history...</p>

<p class="fst">The quarrelling of the Irish princes amongst themselves greatly simplified pillage and settlement for the Norsemen, and even the temporary conquest of the whole island. The extent to which the Scandinavians considered Ireland as one of their regular pillage grounds is shown by the so-called death-song of Ragnar Lodbroôk, the Krâkumâl, composed about the year 1000 in the snaketower of King Ella of Northumberland. In this song all the ancient pagan savagery is massed together, as if for the last time, and under the pretext of celebrating King Ragnar’s heroic deeds in song, all the Nordic peoples’ raids in their own lands, on coasts from Dunamunde to Flanders, Scotland (here already called Skotland, perhaps for the first time) and Ireland are briefly pictured. About Ireland it is said:</p>
<p class="indentb">“We hew'd with our swords, heap'd high the slain,<br>
Glad was the wolf’s brother of the furious battle’s feast; <br>
lion struck — brass-shields; Ireland’s ruler, Marsteinn,<br>
Did not starve the murder-wolf or eagle;<br>
In Vedbrafiördhr the raven was given a sacrifice.<br>
We hew'd with our swords, started a game at dawn, <br>
A merry battle against three kings at Lindiseyri;<br>
Not many could boast that they fled unhurt from there.<br>
Falcon fought wolf for flesh, the wolf’s fury devoured many;<br>
The blood of the Irish flow'd in streams on the beach in the battle.”</p>
<p></p>
<p class="indentb">“Hiuggu ver medh hiörvi, hverr la thverr of annan; <br>
gladhr vardh gera brodhir getu vidh sôknar laeti, <br>
lêt ei o:rn nêýlgi, sâer Irlandi stýrdhi, <br>
(môt vardh mâlms ok rîtar) Marsteinn konungr fasta; <br>
vardh î Vedhra firdhi valtafn gefit hrafni.</p>
<p class="indentb">Hiuggu ver medh hio:rvi, hâdhum sudhr at morni <br>
leik fyrir Lindiseyri vidh lofdhûnga threnna;<br>
fârr âtti thvî fagna (fêll margr i gyn ûlfi, <br>
haukr sleit hold medh vargi), at harm heill thadhan kaemi; <br>
Ýra blödh î oegi aerit fêll um skaeru.”</p>
<p>Vedhrafiördhr is, as we have said, Waterford; I do not know whether Lindiseyri has been discovered anywhere. On no account does it mean Leinster as Johnstone translates it; eyri (sandy neck of land, Danish öre) points to a quite distinct locality. Valtafn can also mean falcon feed and is generally translated as such here, but as the raven is Odin’s holy bird, the word obviously has both meanings.</p>

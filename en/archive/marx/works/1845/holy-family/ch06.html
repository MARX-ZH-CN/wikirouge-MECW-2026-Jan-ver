<h1>Absolute Critical Criticism,<br>
Or Critical Criticism As Herr Bruno</h1>
<a id="6.1"></a>
<h3>1) Absolute Criticism’s First Campaign</h3>
<a id="6.1.a"></a>
<h4>a) “Spirit” and “Mass”</h4>
<p>So far Critical Criticism has seemed to deal more or less with the Critical treatment of various mass-type objects. We now find it dealing with the absolutely Critical object, <i>with</i> <i>itself. </i>So far it has derived its relative glory from Critical debasement, rejection and transformation of <i>definite</i> mass-type objects and persons. It now derives its <i>absolute</i> glory from the Critical debasement, rejection and transformation of the Mass in general. Relative Criticism was faced with relative limits. Absolute Criticism is faced with an absolute limit, the limit of the Mass, the Mass as limit. Relative Criticism in its opposition to definite limits was itself necessarily a <i>limited</i> individual. Absolute Criticism, in its opposition to the <i>general</i> limit, to limit in general, is necessarily an <i>absolute</i> individual. As the various mass-type objects and persons have merged in the <i>impure</i> pulp of the “<i>Mass</i>”, so has still seemingly objective and personal Criticism changed into “<i>pure Criticism</i>”. So far Criticism has appeared to be more or less a quality of the Critical individuals: Reichardt, Edgar, Faucher, etc. Now it is the <i>Subject</i> and Herr Bruno is its incarnation.</p>
<p>So far <i>mass character</i> has seemed to be more or less the quality of the objects and persons criticised; now objects and persons have become the “<i>Mass</i>”,<i> </i>and the “<i>Mass</i>” has become object and person. All previous Critical attitudes have been dissolved in the attitude of absolute Critical wisdom to absolute mass-type stupidity. This <i>basic attitude</i> appears as the <i>meaning</i>, the <i>tendency</i> and the <i>keyword</i> of Criticism’s previous deeds and struggles.</p>
<p>In accordance with its absolute character, “pure” Criticism, as soon as it appears, will pronounce the differentiating “<i>cue</i>”; nevertheless, as Absolute Spirit it must go through a dialectical process. Only at the end of its heavenly motion will its original concept be truly realised (see Hegel, <i>Enzyklopädie</i>).</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Only a few months ago,” Absolute Criticism announces, “the Mass believed itself to be of gigantic strength and destined to world mastery within a time that it could count on its fingers.”</p>
<p>It was precisely Herr <i>Bruno Bauer</i>, in <i>Die gute Sache der Freiheit</i> <span class="context">[The Good Cause of Freedom]</span> (his “<i>own</i>” cause, of course), in <i>Die Judenfrage</i>, <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume04/footnote.html#22" target=_blank>[22]</a></sup> etc., who counted on his fingers the time until the approaching world mastery, although he admitted he could not give the exact date. To the record of the sins of the Mass he adds the mass of his own sins.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“The Mass thought itself in possession of so many truths which seemed obvious to it.” “But one <i>possesses a truth</i> completely only ... when one follows it through <i>its </i>proofs.”</p>
<p>For Herr Bauer, as for Hegel, truth is an <i>automaton</i> that proves itself. Man must <i>follow</i> it. As in Hegel, the result of real development is nothing but the <i>truth proven</i>, — i.e., brought to <i>consciousness. </i>Absolute Criticism may therefore ask with the most’ narrow-minded theologian:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“<i>What </i>would be the purpose of <i>history</i> if it; task were not precisely to <i>prove</i> these simplest of all truths (such as the movement of the earth round the sun)?”</p>
<p>Just as, according to the earlier teleologists, plants exist to be eaten by animals, and animals to be eaten by men, history exists in order to serve as the act of consumption of theoretical eating — <i>proving</i>. Man exists so that history may exist, and history exists so that the <i>proof of truths </i>exists. In this <i>Critically </i>trivialised form is repeated the speculative wisdom that man exists, and history exists, so that <i>truth </i>may arrive at <i>self-consciousness.</i></p>
<p>That is why <i>history</i>, like <i>truth</i>, becomes a person apart, a metaphysical subject of which the real human individuals are merely the bearers. That is why Absolute Criticism uses phrases like these:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“<i>History</i> does not allow itself to be mocked at ... <i>History </i>has exerted <i>its </i>greatest efforts to ... <i>History </i>has been engaged ... what would be the purpose of History?... <i>History </i>provides the explicit proof ... <i>History</i> puts forward truths,” etc.</p>
<p>If, as Absolute Criticism asserts, history has so far been occupied with only a <i>few</i> such truths — the simplest of all — which in the end are self-evident, this inadequacy to which Absolute Criticism reduces previous human experiences proves first of all only its own inadequacy. From the un-Critical standpoint the result of history is, on the contrary, that the most complicated truth, the quintessence of all truth, man, is self-evident in the end.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“But truths,” Absolute Criticism continues to argue, “which <i>seem</i> to the mass to be so crystal-clear that they are self-evident <i>from the start </i>... and that the mass regards proof of them as superfluous, are not worth history supplying explicit proof of them; they are in general no part of the problem which history is engaged in solving.”</p>
<p>In its holy zeal against the mass, Absolute Criticism pays it the finest compliment. If a truth is <i>crystal-clear </i>because it <i>seems</i> crystal-clear to the mass; if history’s <i>attitude </i>to truths <i>depends </i>on the <i>opinion</i> of the mass, then the verdict of the mass is absolute, infallible, the <i>law </i>of history, and history proves only what does not seem crystal-clear to the mass, and therefore needs proof. It is the mass, then, that prescribes history’s “task” and “occupation”.</p>
<p>Absolute Criticism speaks of “truths which are self-evident <i>from the start. </i>In its Critical naivety it invents an absolute “<i>from the start</i>” and an abstract, immutable “<i>mass</i>”. There is just as little difference, in the eyes of Absolute Criticism, between the “from the start” of the sixteenth-century mass and the “from the start” of the nineteenth-century mass as there is between those masses themselves. It is precisely the characteristic feature of a truth which has become true and obvious and is self-evident that it is “self-evident <i>from the start</i>”. Absolute Criticism’s polemic against truths which are self-evident from the start is a polemic against truths which are “self-evident” in general.</p>
<p>A truth which is self-evident has lost its savour, its meaning, its value for Absolute Criticism as it has for divine <i>dialectic</i>. It has become flat, like stale water. On the one hand, therefore, Absolute Criticism proves everything which is self-evident and, in addition, many things which have the luck to be incomprehensible and therefore will never be self-evident. On the other hand, it considers as self-evident everything which needs some elaboration. Why? Because it is <i>self</i>-evident that <i>real problems </i>are not self-evident.</p>
<p>Since, <i>the</i> “Truth”, like history, is an ethereal subject separate from the material mass, it addresses itself not to the empirical man but to the “<i>innermost depths of the soul</i>”; in order to be “<i>truly apprehended</i>” it does not act on his <i>vulgar body</i>, which may live deep down in an English cellar or at the top of a French block of flats; it “stretches” “from end to end” through his idealistic intestines. Absolute Criticism does certify that “the mass” has so far in its own way, i.e., superficially, been affected by the truths that history has been so gracious as to “put forward”; but at the same time it prophesies that</p>
<p class="quoteb">“the <i>attitude </i>of the <i>mass </i>to <i>historical progress </i>will “<i>completely change</i>”.</p>
<p>It will not be long before the mysterious meaning of this Critical prophecy becomes “crystal-clear” to us.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“All great actions of previous history,” we are told, “were failures <i>from the start </i>and had no effective success because the mass became <i>interested</i> in and <i>enthusiastic</i> over them — or, they were bound to come to a pitiful end because the idea underlying them was such that it had to be content with a superficial comprehension and therefore to rely on the approval of the mass.”</p>
<p>It seems that the comprehension which suffices for, and therefore corresponds to, an idea ceases to be superficial. It is only for appearance’s <i>sake </i>that Herr Bruno brings out a <i>relation</i> between an <i>idea</i> and its <i>comprehension</i>, just as it is only for <i>appearance’s sake</i> that he brings out a <i>relation</i> between unsuccessful historical action and the <i>mass</i>. If, therefore, Absolute Criticism condemns something as “superficial”, it is simply previous history, the actions and ideas of which were those of the “masses”. It rejects <i>mass-type</i> — history to replace it by <i>Critical</i> history (see Herr Jules Faucher on English problems of the day). According to previous <i>un-Critical</i> history, i.e., history not conceived in the sense of Absolute Criticism, it must further be precisely distinguished to what extent the <i>mass</i> was “<i>interested</i>” in aims and to what extent it was “<i>enthusiastic</i>” over them.. The “<i>idea</i>” always disgraced itself insofar as it differed from the “<i>interest</i>”. On the other hand, it is easy to understand that every mass-type “<i>interest</i>” that asserts itself historically goes far beyond its real limits in the “<i>idea</i>” or “<i>imagination</i>” when it-first comes on the scene and is confused with <i>human</i> interest in general. This <i>illusion</i> constitutes what <i>Fourier</i> calls the <i>tone</i> of each historical epoch. The <i>interest</i> of the bourgeoisie in the 1789 Revolution, far from having been a “<i>failure</i>”, “<i>won</i>” everything and had “<i>most</i> <i>effective success</i>”,<i> </i>however much its “<i>pathos</i>” has evaporated and the “<i>enthusiastic</i>” flowers with which that Interest adorned its cradle have faded. That interest was so powerful that it was victorious over the pen of Marat, the guillotine of the Terror and the sword of Napoleon as well as the crucifix and the blue blood of the Bourbons. The Revolution was a “failure” only for the mass which did not have in the <i>political</i> “idea” the idea of its real “<i>interest</i>”, i.e., whose true life-principle did not coincide with the life-principle of the Revolution, the mass whose real conditions for emancipation were essentially different from the conditions within which the bourgeoisie could emancipate itself and society. If the Revolution, which can exemplify all great historical “actions”, was a failure, it was so because the mass within whose living conditions it essentially came to a stop, was an <i>exclusive, limited</i> mass, not an all-embracing one. If the Revolution was a failure it was not because the mass was “<i>enthusiastic</i>” over it and “<i>interested</i>” in it, but because the most numerous part of the mass, the part distinct from the bourgeoisie, did not have its <i>real</i> interest in the principle of the Revolution, did not have a revolutionary principle of its own, but <i>only</i> an “<i>idea</i>”, and hence only an object of momentary enthusiasm and only seeming <i>uplift</i>.</p>
<p>Together with the thoroughness of the historical action, the size of the mass whose action it is will therefore increase. In Critical history, according to which in historical actions it is not a matter of the acting masses, of empirical action, or of the empirical interest of this action, but instead is only “a matter of an <i>idea in them</i>”, things must naturally take a different course.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“<i>In the mass</i>,” Criticism teaches us, “<i>not somewhere else, </i>as its former liberal spokesmen believed, <i>is the enemy of the spirit to be found</i>.”</p>
<p>The enemies of progress <i>outside </i>the mass are precisely those <i>products </i>of <i>self-debasement, self-rejection </i>and <i>self-alienation </i>of the <i>mass </i>which have been endowed with independent being and a life of their <i>own</i>. The mass therefore turns against its <i>own</i> deficiency when it turns against the independently existing <i>products</i> of its <i>self-debasement</i>, just as man, turning against the existence of God, turns against his <i>own religiosity</i>. But as those <i>practical</i> self-alienations of the mass exist in the real world in an outward way, the mass must fight them in an <i>outward</i> way. It must by no means hold these products of its self-alienation for mere <i>ideal</i> fantasies, mere <i>alienations of self-consciousness, </i>and must not wish to abolish material estrangement by purely <i>inward spiritual</i> action. As early as 1789 Loustalot’s journal bore the motto:</p>
<p class="quoteb">Les grands ne nous paraissent grands<br>
Que parce que nous sommes à genoux<br>
 — Levons nous! — </p>
<p class="quoteb">[The great appear great in our eyes<br>
Only because we are kneeling.<br>
Let us rise!]</p>
<p>But to rise it is not enough to do so in <i>thought </i>and to leave hanging over one’s <i>real sensuously perceptible </i>head the <i>real sensuously</i> <i>perceptible</i> yoke that cannot be subtilised away with ideas. Yet <i>Absolute Criticism</i> has learnt from Hegel’s <i>Phänomenologie</i> at least <i>the </i>art of converting <i>real objective </i>chains that exist <i>outside me</i> into <i>merely ideal</i>, merely <i>subjective </i>chains, existing merely <i>in me </i>and thus of converting all external sensuously perceptible struggles into pure struggles of thought.</p>
<p>This Critical transformation is the basis of the <i>pre-established harmony </i>between <i>Critical Criticism </i>and the <i>censorship</i>. From the Critical point of view, the writer’s fight against the censor is not a fight of “man against man”. The censor is nothing but <i>my own tact</i> <i>personified</i> for me by the solicitous police, my own tact struggling against my tactlessness and un-Criticalness. The struggle of the writer with the censor is only seemingly, only in the eyes of wicked sensuousness, anything else than the <i>inner </i>struggle of the writer <i>with himself</i>. <i>Insofar</i> as the censor is <i>really individually different </i>from myself, a <i>police executioner</i> who mishandles the product of my mind by applying an external standard alien to the matter in question, he is a mere <i>mass-type</i> fantasy, an <i>un-Critical figment of the brain</i>. When Feuerbach’s <i>Thesen zur Reform der Philosophy </i><sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume04/footnote.html#23" target=_blank>[23]</a></sup> were prohibited by the censorship, it was not the official barbarity of the censorship that was to blame but the uncultured character of Feuerbach’s <i>Thesen</i>. “<i>Pure</i>” Criticism, unsullied by mass or matter, too, has in the censor a purely “ethereal” form, divorced from all mass-type reality.</p>
<p>Absolute Criticism has declared the “<i>Mass</i>” to be the <i>true enemy of the Spirit</i>. It develops this in more detail as follows: </p>
<p class="quoteb">“The Spirit now knows where to <i>look </i>for<i> its </i>only<i> adversary</i> — in the self-deception and the pithlessness of the Mass.”</p>
<p>Absolute Criticism proceeds from the <i>dogma </i>of the absolute competency of the “<i>Spirit</i>”. Furthermore, it proceeds from the <i>dogma </i>of the <i>extramundane </i>existence of the Spirit, i.e., of its existence outside the mass of humanity. Finally, it transforms “<i>the </i>Spirit”, “<i>Progress</i>”, on the one hand, and “<i>the Mass</i>”, on the other, into <i>fixed </i>entities, into concepts, and then relates them to one another as such given rigid extremes. It does not occur to Absolute Criticism to investigate <i>the</i> “<i>Spirit</i>” itself, to find out whether it is not in its spiritualistic nature, in its airy pretensions, that the “Phrase”, “self-deception” and “pithlessness” are rooted. No, the Spirit is <i>absolute</i>, but unfortunately at the same time it continually turns into <i>spiritlessness; </i>it continually reckons without its host. Hence it must necessarily have an <i>adversary</i> that intrigues against it. That adversary is the Mass.</p>
<p>The position is the same with “<i>Progress</i>”. In spite of the pretensions of “<i>Progress</i>”, continual <i>retrogressions</i> and <i>circular movements</i> occur. Far from suspecting that the category “<i>Progress</i>” is completely empty and abstract, Absolute Criticism is so profound as to recognise “<i>Progress</i>” as being absolute, so as to explain retrogression by assuming a “<i>personal adversary</i>” of Progress, <i>the</i> <i>Mass. As “the Mass</i>” is nothing but the “<i>opposite of the Spirit</i>”, of <i>Progress, </i>of “<i>Criticism</i>”, it can accordingly be defined only by this imaginary opposition; apart from that opposition all that Criticism can say about the meaning and the existence of the Mass is only something <i>meaningless</i>, because completely undefined:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“The Mass, in <i>that sense </i>in which the ‘<i>word’ also </i>embraces the <i>so-called </i>educated world.”</p>
<p>“Also” and “so-called suffice for a Critical definition. The “Mass” is therefore distinct from the <i>real</i> masses and exists as <i>the</i> “<i>Mass</i>” only for “<i>Criticism</i>”.</p>
<p>All communist and socialist writers proceeded from the observation that, on the one hand, even the most favourably brilliant deeds seemed to remain without brilliant results, to end in trivialities, and, on the other, <i>all progress of the Spirit</i> had so far been <i>progress against the mass of mankind</i>, driving it into an ever more <i>dehumanised</i> situation. They therefore declared “<i>progress</i>” (see <i>Fourier</i>) to be an inadequate, abstract phrase; they assumed (see <i>Owen</i> among others) a fundamental flaw in the civilised world; that is why they subjected the <i>real</i> foundations of contemporary society to incisive <i>criticism</i>. This communist criticism had practically at once as its counterpart the movement of the great mass, in opposition to which history had been developing so far. One must know the studiousness, the craving for knowledge, the moral energy and ‘the unceasing urge for development of the French and English workers to be able to form an idea of the human nobility of this movement.</p>
<p>How infinitely <i>profound</i> then is “Absolute Criticism”, which, in face of these intellectual and practical facts, sees in a one-sided way only <i>one</i> aspect of the relationship, the continual foundering of the Spirit, and, vexed at this, seeks in addition an <i>adversary</i> of the “Spirit”, which it finds in <i>the</i> “Mass"! In the end this great Critical <i>discovery</i> amounts to a <i>tautology</i>. According to Criticism, <i>the</i> Spirit has so far had a limit, an obstacle, in other words, an <i>adversary</i>, <i>because </i>it has had an <i>adversary</i>. Who, then, is the adversary of the <i>Spirit</i>? <i>Spiritlessness. </i>For the Mass is defined only as the “opposite” of the Spirit, as <i>spiritlessness </i>or, to take the more precise definitions of spiritlessness, as “indolence”, “superficiality”, “self-complacency”. What a fundamental superiority over the communist writers it is not to have traced spiritlessness, indolence, superficiality and self-complacency to their places of origin, but to have denounced them <i>morally</i> and <i>exposed</i> them as the opposite of the Spirit, of Progress! If these qualities are proclaimed qualities of <i>the</i> Mass, as of a <i>subject </i>still distinct from them, that distinction is nothing but a “Critical” <i>semblance</i> of distinction. Only in <i>appearance</i> has Absolute Criticism a <i>definite</i> concrete subject besides the abstract qualities of spiritlessness, indolence, etc., for “<i>the</i> <i>Mass</i>” in the Critical conception is <i>nothing</i> but those abstract qualities, another <i>word</i> for them, a <i>fantastic personification</i> of them. . The relation between “Spirit and Mass” has, however, also a <i>hidden</i> meaning which will be completely revealed in the course of the reasoning. We only indicate it here. That relation <i>discovered</i> by Herr Bruno is, in fact, nothing but a <i>Critically caricatured consummation of Hegel’s conception of history</i>, which, in turn, is nothing but the <i>speculative</i> expression of the <i>Christian-Germanic</i> dogma of the antithesis between <i>Spirit</i> and <i>Matter</i>, between God and the world-. This antithesis finds expression in history, in the human world itself in such a way that a few chosen <i>individuals</i> as the <i>active Spirit</i> are counterposed to the rest of mankind, as the <i>spiritless Mass, </i>as <i>Matter.</i></p>
<p><i>Hegel’s</i> conception of history presupposes an <i>Abstract</i> or<i> Absolute</i> <i>Spirit</i> which develops in such a way that mankind is a mere <i>mass</i> that bears the Spirit with a varying degree of consciousness or. unconsciousness. Within <i>empirical</i>, exoteric history, therefor e, Hegel makes a speculative, esoteric history, develop. The history of mankind becomes the history of the <i>Abstract Spirit</i> of mankind, hence a <i>spirit far removed </i>from the real man.</p>
<p>Parallel with this doctrine of Hegel’s there developed in France the theory of the <i>doctrinaires</i> <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume04/footnote.html#24" target=_blank>[24]</a></sup> proclaiming the <i>sovereignty of reason</i> in opposition to the <i>sovereignty</i> <i>of the people, </i>in order to exclude the masses and rule <i>alone</i>. This was quite consistent. If the activity of <i>real</i> mankind is nothing but the activity of a mass of human individuals, then abstract <i>generality, Reason, the</i> Spirit, on the contrary, must have an abstract expression restricted to a few individuals. It then depends on the situation and imaginative power of each individual whether he will claim to be this representative of “the Spirit”.</p>
<p>Already in <i>Hegel </i>the <i>Absolute Spirit </i>of history has its material in the <i>Mass</i> and finds its appropriate expression only in <i>philosophy</i>. <i>The</i> philosopher, however, is only the organ through which the maker of history, the Absolute Spirit, arrives at self-consciousness <i>retrospectively </i>after the movement has ended. The participation of the philosopher in history is reduced to this retrospective consciousness, for the real movement is accomplished by the Absolute Spirit <i>unconsciously</i>. Hence the philosopher appears on the scene <i>post festum</i> <span class="context">[after the event]</span>.</p>
<p>Hegel is guilty of being doubly half-hearted: firstly in that, while declaring that philosophy is the mode of existence of the Absolute Spirit, he refuses to recognise the <i>actual philosophical individual</i> as the <i>Absolute</i> Spirit; secondly, in that he lets the Absolute Spirit as Absolute Spirit make history only in <i>appearance</i>. For since the Absolute Spirit becomes <i>conscious</i> of itself as the creative World Spirit only <i>post festum</i> in the philosopher, its making of history exists only in the consciousness, in the opinion and conception of the philosopher, i.e., only in the speculative imagination. Herr Bruno Bauer overcomes Hegel’s half-heartedness.</p>
<p><i>Firstly</i>, he proclaims <i>Criticism</i> to be the Absolute Spirit and <i>himself</i> to be <i>Criticism</i>. Just as the element of Criticism is banished from the Mass, so the element of the Mass is banished from Criticism. Therefore <i>Criticism</i> sees itself incarnate not in a <i>mass,</i> but exclusively in a <i>handful</i> of chosen men, in Herr <i>Bauer</i> and his disciples.</p>
<p>Herr Bauer furthermore overcomes Hegel’s other half-heartedness. No longer, like the Hegelian Spirit, does he make history <i>post festum</i> and in imagination. He <i>consciously</i> plays the part of the <i>World Spirit</i> in opposition to the mass of the rest of mankind; he enters into a contemporary <i>dramatic</i> relation with that mass; he invents and executes history with a purpose and after mature reflection.</p>
<p>On the one side is the Mass as the passive, spiritless, unhistorical, <i>material</i> element of history. On the other is <i>the</i> Spirit, <i>Criticism</i>, Herr Bruno and Co. as the active element from which all <i>historical</i> action proceeds. The act of transforming society is reduced to the <i>cerebral activity</i> of Critical Criticism.</p>
<p>Indeed, the relation of Criticism, and hence of Criticism incarnate, Herr Bruno and Co., to the Mass is in truth the only historical relation of the present time. The whole of present-day history is reduced to the movement of these two sides against each other. All antitheses have been dissolved in this <i>Critical</i> antithesis.</p>
<p>Critical Criticism, which becomes <i>objective</i> to itself only in relation to its antithesis, to the Mass, to <i>stupidity</i>, is consequently obliged continually <i>to produce </i>this antithesis for itself, and Herren Faucher, Edgar and Szeliga have supplied sufficient proof of their Virtuosity in their speciality, the <i>mass stupefaction </i>of persons and things.</p>
<p>Let us now accompany Absolute Criticism in its <i>campaigns</i> against the <i>Mass.</i></p>
<a id="6.1.b"></a>
<h4>b) The Jewish Question No. 1.<br>
The Setting of the Questions</h4>
<p>The “Spirit”, contrary to the Mass, behaves from the outset in a <i>Critical way</i> by considering its own narrow-minded work, Bruno Bauer’s <i>Die Judenfrage</i>, as absolute, and only the opponents of that work as sinners. In Reply No. 1 <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume04/footnote.html#25" target=_blank>[25]</a></sup> to attacks on that treatise, he does not show any inkling of its defects; on the contrary, he declares he has set forth the “true”, “<i>general</i>” (!) significance of the Jewish question. In later replies we shall see him obliged to admit his “<i>oversights</i>”.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“The reception my book has had is the <i>beginning</i> of the proof that the very ones who so far have advocated freedom, and still advocate it, must rise against the Spirit more than any others; the defence of my book which 1 am now going to undertake will supply further pond how thoughtless the <i>spokesmen of the Mass</i> are; they have God knows what a great opinion of themselves for supporting emancipation and the dogma of the ‘<i>rights of man’.</i>”</p>
<p>On the occasion of a treatise by Absolute Criticism, the “Mass” must necessarily have <i>begun</i> to prove its antithesis to the Spirit; for it is its antithesis to Absolute Criticism that <i>determines</i> and <i>proves</i> its very <i>existence</i>.</p>
<p>The polemic of a few liberal and rationalist Jews against Herr Bruno’s <i>Die Judenfrage</i> has naturally a Critical meaning quite different from that of the mass-type polemic of the liberals against philosophy and of the rationalists against Strauss. Incidentally, the originality of the above-quoted remark can be judged by the following passage from <i>Hegel</i>:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“We can here note the particular form of bad conscience manifest in the kind of eloquence with which that shallowness” (of the liberals) “plumes itself, and first of all in the fact that it speaks most of <i>Spirit</i> where its speech has the <i>least spirit</i>, and uses the word <i>life</i>”, etc., “where it is most dead and withered.” <span class="context">[G.W.F. Hegel, Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts. Vorrede]</span></p>
<p>As for the “<i>rights of man</i>”, it has been proved to Herr Bruno (“On the Jewish Question”, <i>Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher</i>) that it is “<i>he himself’, </i>not the <i>spokesmen of the Mass, </i>who has misunderstood and dogmatically mishandled the essence of those rights. Compared to his discovery that the rights of man are not “<i>inborn</i>” — a discovery which has been made innumerable times in England during the last 40-odd years — Fourier’s assertion that the right to fish, to hunt, etc., are inborn rights of men is one of genius.</p>
<p>We give only a few examples of Herr Bruno’s fight against <i>Philippson</i>, <i>Hirsch</i> and others. Even such poor opponents as these are not disposed of by Absolute Criticism. It is by no means preposterous of Herr <i>Philippson</i>, as Absolute Criticism maintains, to say:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Bauer conceives a peculiar kind of state ... a <i>philosophical ideal </i>of a <i>state.</i>”</p>
<p>Herr Bruno, who confuses the state with humanity, the rights of man with man and political emancipation with human emancipation, was bound, if not to conceive, at least to imagine a peculiar kind of state, a philosophical ideal of a state.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Instead of writing his laboured statement, the rhetorician” (Herr Hirsch) “would have done better to refute my proof that the <i>Christian state</i>, having as its vital principle a definite religion, cannot allow adherents of another particular religion ... complete equality with its own social estates.”</p>
<p>Had the rhetorician <i>Hirsch</i> really refuted Herr Bruno’s proof and shown, as is done in the <i>Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher</i>, that the state of social estates and of exclusive Christianity is not only an incomplete state but an incomplete <i>Christian</i> state, Herr Bruno would have answered as he does to that refutation:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Objections in this matter are meaningless.” <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume04/footnote.html#26" target=_blank>[26]</a></sup></p>
<p class="fst">Herr Hirsch is quite correct when in answer to Herr Bruno’s statement:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“By pressure against the mainsprings of history the Jews provided counterpressure”,</p>
<p class="fst">he recalls:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Then they must have counted for something in the making of history, and if Bauer himself asserts this, he has no right to assert, on the other hand, that they did not contribute anything to the making of modern times.”</p>
<p class="fst">Herr Bruno answers:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“An eyesore is something too — does that mean it contributes to develop my eyesight?”</p>
<p>Something which has been an eyesore to me from birth, as the Jews have been to the Christian world, and which persists and develops with the eye is not an ordinary sore, but a wonderful one, one that really belongs to my eye and must even contribute to a highly original development of my eyesight. The Critical “<i>eyesore</i>” does not therefore hurt the rhetorician “<i>Hirsch</i>”. Incidentally, the criticism quoted above revealed to Herr Bruno the significance of Jewry in “the <i>making</i> of modern times”.</p>
<p>The theological mind of Absolute Criticism feels so offended by a <i>deputy of the Rhenish Landtag </i>stating that “the Jews are <i>queer</i> in their own Jewish way, not in our so-called Christian way”, that it is still “calling him <i>to order </i>for using that argument”.</p>
<p>Concerning the assertion of another deputy that “civil equality of the Jews can be implemented only where Jewry no longer exists”, Herr Bruno comments:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Correct! That is correct if Criticism’s other proposition, which 1 put forward in my treatise, is not omitted”, namely the proposition that Christianity also must have ceased to exist.</p>
<p>We see that in its Reply No. 1 to the attacks upon <i>Die Judenfrage</i>, Absolute Criticism still regards the abolition of religion . atheism, as the condition for civil equality. In its first stage it has therefore not yet acquired any deeper insight into the essence of the state than into the “<i>oversights</i>” of its “<i>work</i>”.</p>
<p>Absolute Criticism feels offended when one of its <i>intended</i> “latest” scientific discoveries is betrayed as something already generally recognised. A Rhenish deputy remarks:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“No one has yet maintained that France and Belgium were distinguished by particular clarity in recognising principles in the organisation of their political affairs.”</p>
<p>Absolute Criticism could have objected that that assertion transferred the present into the past by representing as traditional the now trivial view of the inadequacy of French political principles. Such a relevant objection ‘ would not be profitable for Absolute Criticism. On the contrary, it must assert the obsolete view to be that at present prevailing, and proclaim the now prevailing view a Critical mystery which its investigation still has to reveal to the Mass. Hence it must say:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“It” (the antiquated prejudice) “has been asserted <i>by very many</i>” (of the Mass): “<i>but a</i> <i>thorough investigation</i> of history <i>will</i> provide the proof that even after the great work done by France to comprehend the principles, <i>much</i> <i>still remains to be achieved.</i>”</p>
<p>That means that a thorough investigation of history will not itself “<i>achieve</i>” the comprehension of the principles. It will only <i>prove</i> in its thoroughness that “<i>much still remains to be achieved</i>”.<i> A</i> great achievement, especially after the works of the Socialists! Nevertheless Herr Bruno <i>already</i> achieves <i>much</i> for the comprehension of the present social state of things by his remark:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“The <i>certainty</i> prevailing at present is <i>uncertainty</i>.”</p>
<p>If Hegel says that the prevailing Chinese certainty is “Being”, that the prevailing <i>Indian</i> certainty is “Nothing”, etc., Absolute Criticism joins him in the “pure” way when it resolves the character of the present time in the logical category “<i>Uncertainty</i>”, and all the purer since “Uncertainty”, like “Being” and “Nothing”, belongs to the first chapter of speculative logic, the chapter on “<i>Quality</i>”.</p>
<p>We cannot leave No. 1 of <i>Die Judenfrage </i>without a general remark.</p>
<p>One of the chief pursuits of Absolute Criticism consists in first bringing all questions of the day into their <i>right setting</i>. For it does not answer the <i>real</i> questions — it substitutes <i>quite different</i> ones. As it makes everything, it must also first make the “questions of the day”, make them <i>its own</i> questions, questions of Critical Criticism. If it were a question of the Code Napoléon, it would prove that it is <i>properly</i> a question of the <i>Pentateuch</i>. <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume04/footnote.html#27" target=_blank>[27]</a></sup> Its <i>setting</i> of “questions of the day” is Critical <i>distortion</i> and <i>misrepresentation</i> of them. It thus distorted the “Jewish question”, too, in such a way that it did not need to investigate <i>political emancipation</i>, which is the subject-matter of that question, but could instead confine itself to a criticism of the Jewish religion and a description of the Christian-Germanic state.</p>
<p>This method, too, like all Absolute Criticism’s originalities, is the repetition of a <i>speculative</i> verbal trick. <i>Speculative</i> philosophy, namely, <i>Hegel’s</i> philosophy, had to transpose all questions from the form of common sense to the form of speculative reason and convert the real question into a <i>speculative</i> one to be able to answer it. Having distorted <i>my</i> question on my lips and, like the catechism, put <i>its own </i>question into my mouth, it could, of course, like the catechism, have its ready answer to all my questions.</p>

<h4>c) Hinrichs No. 1.<br>
Mysterious Hints on Politics, Socialism and Philosophy</h4>
<p>“<i>Political!</i>” Absolute Criticism is literally horrified at the presence of this word in Professor <i>Hinrichs’ </i>lectures. <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume04/footnote.html#28" target=_blank>[28]</a></sup></p>
<p class="quoteb">“Whoever has followed the development of modern times and knows history will also know that the political movements at present taking place have a significance <i>quite different</i>” (!) “from a <i>political</i> one: at their base” (at their base! ... now for basic wisdom) “they have a <i>social</i>” (!) “significance, which, as we know” (!) “is such” (!) “that <i>all</i> political interests appear <i>insignificant</i>” (!) “in comparison with it.”</p>
<p>A few months before the Critical <i>Literatur-Zeitung</i> began to be published, there appeared, <i>as we know</i> (!), Herr Bruno’s fantastic political treatise: <i>Staat, Religion und Parthei</i>!</p>
<p>If <i>political</i> movements <i>have social significance</i>, how can political interests appear “<i>insignificant</i>” in comparison with their own social significance?</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Herr Hinrichs does not know his way about either in his own house or anywhere else in the world.... He could not be at home anywhere <i>because</i> ... <i>because</i> Criticism, which in the last four years has begun and carried on its <i>by no means</i> ‘<i>political</i>’ but ‘<i>social'</i>” (!) “work, has remained <i>completely</i>” (!) “unknown to him.”</p>
<p><i>Criticism</i>, which according to the opinion of the Mass carried on “by no means <i>political</i>” but “in <i>all</i> respects <i>theological</i>” work, is still content with the <i>word “social</i>”,<i> </i>even now when it has uttered this <i>word</i> for the first time, not just in the last four years, but since its literary birth.</p>
<p>Since socialist writings spread in Germany the recognition that all human aspirations and actions without exception have <i>social</i> significance, Herr Bruno can call his theological works social too. But what a <i>Critical</i> demand it is that Professor Hinrichs should have derived socialism from an <i>acquaintance</i> with <i>Bauer’s</i> works, considering that all Bruno Bauer’s works published up to the appearance of Hinrichs’ lectures, when they do draw practical conclusions, draw <i>political</i> ones! It was impossible, un-Critically speaking, for Professor Hinrichs to supplement Herr Bruno’s published works with his as yet unpublished ones. From the Critical point of view, the Mass is, of course, obliged to interpret all Absolute Criticism’s mass-type “movements”, as well as “political” ones, from the angle of the future and of Absolute Progress! But in order that Herr Hinrichs, after becoming acquainted with the <i>Literatur-Zeitung</i>, may never again forget the word “<i>social</i>” or fail to recognise the “<i>social</i>” character of <i>Criticism</i>, <i>Criticism</i> prohibits the word “political” for the third time before the whole world and solemnly repeats the word “<i>social</i>” for the third time.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“If the <i>true </i>tendency of modern history is considered it is <i>no longer a question of political, but</i> — but of <i>social</i> significance”, etc.</p>
<p>Just as Professor Hinrichs is the scapegoat for the former political” movements, so is he also for the “<i>Hegelian</i>” movements and expressions which Absolute Criticism used intentionally up to the publication of the <i>Literatur-Zeitung</i>, and continues to use unintentionally in it.</p>
<p>Once “<i>real Hegelian</i>” and twice “<i>Hegelian philosopher</i>” are thrown in Hinrichs’ face as catchwords. Herr Bruno even “<i>hopes</i>” that the “banal expressions so tiresomely circulated in all the books of the <i>Hegelian</i> school” (in particular in his own books) will, <i>in</i> <i>view of </i>their great “<i>exhaustion</i>” as seen in Professor Hinrichs’ lectures, soon reach the end of their journey. From the “<i>exhaustion</i>” <i>of Professor Hinrichs</i>, Herr Bruno hopes for the dissolution of <i>Hegel’s philosophy </i>and thereby <i>his own redemption</i> from it.</p>
<p>Thus in its <i>first campaign</i> Absolute Criticism overthrows its own long-worshipped gods, “<i>Politics</i>” and “<i>Philosophy’,</i> declaring them idols of Professor Hinrichs.</p>
<p>Glorious first campaign!</p>

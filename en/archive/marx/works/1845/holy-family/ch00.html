<h1>Foreword</h1>
<p><i>Real humanism</i> has no more dangerous enemy in Germany than <i>spiritualism</i>
or <i>speculative idealism</i>, which substitutes <i>"self-consciousness"</i>
or the <i>''spirit"</i> for the <i>real individual man</i> and with the
evangelist teaches: "It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth
nothing." Needless to say, this incorporeal spirit is spiritual only in
its imagination. What we are combating in <i>Bauer's</i> criticism is precisely
<i>speculation</i> reproducing itself as a <i>caricature. </i>We see in
it the most complete expression of the <i>Christian-Germanic</i> principle,
which makes its last effort by transforming <i>"criticism"</i> itself into
a transcendent power.

<p>Our exposition deals first and foremost with <i>Bruno Bauer's Allgemeine
Literatur-Zeitung</i> -- the first eight numbers are here before us --
because in it Bauer's criticism, and with it the nonsense of <i>German
speculation in general,</i> has reached its peak. The more completely Critical
Criticism (the criticism of the <i>Literatur-Zeitung) </i>distorts reality
into an obvious comedy through philosophy, the more instructive it is.
-- For examples see <i>Faucher</i> and <i>Szeliga. </i>-- The <i>Literatur-Zeitung</i>
offers material by which even the broad public can be enlightened on the
illusions of speculative philosophy. That is the aim of our book.

<p>Our exposition is naturally determined by its <i>subject</i>. Critical
Criticism is in all respects <i>below</i> the level already attained by
German theoretical development. The nature of our subject therefore justifies
our refraining <i>here</i> from further <i>discussion</i> of that development
itself.

<p>Critical Criticism makes it necessary rather to assert, in contrast
to it, the already achieved results <i>as such</i>.

<p>We therefore give this polemic as a preliminary to the independent works
in which we -- each of us for himself, of course -- shall present our positive
view and thereby our positive attitude to the more recent philosophical
anti social doctrines.

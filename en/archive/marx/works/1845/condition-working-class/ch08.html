<p class="title">Condition of the Working Class in England, by Engels, 1845</p>
<h1>Single Branches of Industry</h1>
<h3>FACTORY-HANDS</h3>
<p>In dealing now with the more important branches of the English manufacturing
proletariat, we shall begin, according to the principle already laid down, with
the factory-workers, i.e., those who are comprised under the Factory Act. This
law regulates the length of the working-day in mills in which wool, silk,
cotton, and flax are spun or woven by means of water or steam-power, and
embraces, therefore, the more important branches of English manufacture. The
class employed by them is the most intelligent and energetic of all the English
workers, and, therefore, the most restless and most hated by the bourgeoisie.
It stands as a whole, and the cotton-workers pre-eminently stand, at the head
of the labour movement, as their masters the manufacturers, especially those of
Lancashire, take the lead of the bourgeois agitation. </p>
<p>We have already seen in the introduction how the population employed in
working up the textile materials were first torn from their former way of life.
It is, therefore, not surprising that the progress of mechanical invention in
later years also affected precisely these workers most deeply and permanently.
The history of cotton manufacture as related by Ure, <a href="#1" id="[1]"><sup class="enote">[1]</sup></a> Baines, <a href="#2" id="[2]"><sup class="enote">[2]</sup></a> and others is the story of
improvements in every direction, most of which have become domesticated in the
other branches of industry as well. Hand-work is superseded by machine-work
almost universally, nearly all manipulations are conducted by the aid of steam
or water, and every year is bringing further improvements. </p>
<p>In a well-ordered state of society, such improvements could only be a source
of rejoicing; in a war of all against all, individuals seize the benefit for
themselves, and so deprive the majority of the means of subsistence. Every
improvement in machinery throws workers out of employment, and the greater the
advance, the more numerous the unemployed; each great improvement produces,
therefore, upon a number of workers the effect of a commercial crisis, creates
want, wretchedness, and crime. Take a few examples. The very first invention,
the jenny, worked by one man, produced at least sixfold what the spinning-wheel
had yielded in the same time; thus every new jenny threw five spinners out of
employment. The throstle, which, in turn, produced much more than the jenny,
and, like it, was worked by one man, threw still more people out of employment.
The mule, which required yet fewer hands in proportion to the product, had the
same effect, and every improvement in the mule, every multiplication of its
spindles, diminished still further the number of workers employed. But this
increase of the number of spindles in the mule is so great that whole armies of
workers have been thrown out of employment by it. For, whereas one spinner,
with a couple of children for piecers, formerly set six hundred spindles in
motion, he could now manage fourteen hundred to two thousand spindles upon two
mules, so that two adult spinners and a part of the piecers whom they employed
were thrown out. And since self- acting mules have been introduced into a very
large number of spinning-mills, the spinners’ work is wholly performed by
the machine. There lies before me a book from the pen of James Leach, <a href="#3" id="[3]"><sup class="enote">[3]</sup></a> one of the recognised
leaders of the Chartists in Manchester. The author has worked for years in
various branches of industry, in mills and coal-mines, and is known to me
personally as an honest, trustworthy, and capable man. In consequence of his
political position, he had at command extensive detailed information as to the
different factories, collected by the workers themselves, and he publishes
tables from which it is clear that in 1841, in 35 factories, 1,083 fewer mule
spinners were employed than in 1829, though the number of spindles in these 35
factories had increased by 99,429. He cites five factories in which no spinners
whatever are employed, self-actors only being used. While the number of
spindles increased by 10 per cent, the number of spinners diminished more than
60 per cent. And Leach adds that since 1841, so many improvements have been
introduced by double-decking and other means, that in some of the factories
named, half the operatives have been discharged. In one factory alone, where
eighty spinners were employed a short time ago, there are now but twenty left;
the others having been discharged or set at children’s work for
children’s wages. Of Stockport Leach tells a similar story, that in 1835,
800 spinners were employed, and in 1843 but 140, though the manufacture of
Stockport has greatly increased during the last eight or nine years. Similar
improvements have now been made in carding-frames, by which one-half the
operatives have been thrown out of employment. In one factory improved frames
have been set up, which have thrown four hands out of eight out of work,
besides which the employer reduced the wages of the four retained from eight
shillings to seven. The same process has gone on in the weaving industry; the
power-loom has taken possession of one branch of hand-weaving after another,
and since it produces much more than the hand-loom, while one weaver can work
two looms, it has superseded a multitude of working-people. And in all sorts of
manufacture, in flax and wool-spinning, in silk-twisting, the case is the same.
The power-loom, too, is beginning to appropriate one branch after another of
wool and linen-weaving; in Rochdale alone, there are more power than hand-looms
in flannel and other wool-weaving branches. The bourgeoisie usually replies to
this, that improvements in machinery, by decreasing the cost of production,
supply finished goods at lower prices, and that these reduced prices cause such
an increase in consumption that the unemployed operatives soon find full
employment in newly founded factories. <a href="#4" id="[4]"><sup class="enote">[4]</sup></a> The bourgeoisie is so far correct that under
certain conditions favourable for the general development of manufacture, every
reduction in price of goods in <i>which the raw material is cheap</i>,
greatly increases consumption, and gives rise to the building of new factories;
but every further word of the assertion is a lie. The bourgeoisie ignores the
fact that it takes years for these results of the decrease in price to follow
and for new factories to be built; it is silent upon the point that every
improvement in machinery throws the real work, the expenditure of force, more
and more upon the machine, and so transforms the work of full-grown men into
mere supervision, which a feeble woman or even a child can do quite as well,
and does for half or two-thirds wages; that, therefore, grown men are
constantly more and more supplanted and <i>not re-employed</i> by the
increase in manufacture; it conceals the fact that whole branches of industry
fall away, or are so changed that they must be learned afresh; and it takes
good care not to confess what it usually harps upon, whenever the question of
forbidding the work of children is broached, that factory-work must be learned
in earliest youth in order to be learned properly. It does not mention the fact
that the process of improvement goes steadily on, and that as soon as the
operative has succeeded in making himself at home in a new branch, if he
actually does succeed in so doing, this, too, is taken from him, and with it
the last remnant of security which remained to him for winning his bread. But
the bourgeoisie gets the benefit of the improvements in machinery; it has a
capital opportunity for piling up money during the first years while many old
machines are still in use, and the improvement not yet universally introduced;
and it would be too much to ask that it should have an open eye for the
disadvantages inseparable from these improvements. </p>
<p>The fact that improved machinery reduces wages has also been as violently
disputed by the bourgeoisie, as it is constantly reiterated by the working-men.
The bourgeoisie insists that although the price of piece-work has been reduced,
yet the total of wages for the week’s work has rather risen than fallen,
and the condition of the operatives rather improved than deteriorated. It is
hard to get to the bottom of the matter, for the operatives usually dwell upon
the price of piece-work. But it is certain that the weekly wage, also, has, in
many branches of work, been reduced by the improvement of machinery. The
so-called fine spinners (who spin fine mule yarn), for instance, do receive
high wages, thirty to forty shillings a week, because they have a powerful
association for keeping wages up, and their craft requires long training; but
the coarse spinners who have to compete against self-actors (which are not as
yet adapted for fine spinning), and whose association was broken down by the
introduction of these machines, receive very low wages. A mule spinner told me
that he does not earn more than fourteen shillings a week, and his statement
agrees with that of Leach, that in various factories the coarse spinners earn
less than sixteen shillings and sixpence a week, and that a spinner, who years
ago earned thirty shillings, can now hardly scrape up twelve and a half, and
had not earned more on an average in the past year. The wages of women and
children may perhaps have fallen less, but only because they were not high from
the beginning. I know several women, widows with children, who have trouble
enough to earn eight to nine shillings a week; and that they and their families
cannot live decently upon that sum, every one must admit who knows the price of
the barest necessaries of life in England. That wages in general have been
reduced by the improvement of machinery is the unanimous testimony of the
operatives. The bourgeois assertion that the condition of the working-class has
been improved by machinery is most vigorously proclaimed a falsehood in every
meeting of working-men in the factory districts. And even if it were true that
the relative wage, the price of piece-work only, has fallen, while the absolute
wage, the sum to be earned in the week, remained unchanged, what would follow?
That the operatives have had quietly to look on while the manufacturers filled
their purses from every improvement without giving the hands the smallest share
in the gain. The bourgeois forgets, in fighting the working-man, the most
ordinary principles of his own Political Economy. He who at other times swears
by Malthus, cries out in his anxiety before the workers: “Where could the
millions by which the population of England has increased find work, without
the improvements in machinery?” <a href="#5" id="[5]"><sup class="enote">[5]</sup></a> As though the bourgeois did not know well enough
that without machinery and the expansion of industry which it produced, these
“millions” would never have been brought into the world and grown
up! The service which machinery has rendered the workers is simply this: that
it has brought home to their minds the necessity of a social reform by means of
which machinery shall no longer work against but for them. Let the wise
bourgeois ask the people who sweep the streets in Manchester and elsewhere
(though even this is past now, since machines for the purpose have been
invented and introduced), or sell salt, matches, oranges, and shoe-strings on
the streets, or even beg, what they were formerly, and he will see how many
will answer: Mill-hands thrown out of work by machinery. The consequences of
improvement in machinery under our present social conditions are, for the
working-man, solely injurious, and often in the highest degree oppressive.
Every new advance brings with it loss of employment, want, and suffering, and
in a country like England where, without that, there is usually a
“surplus population", to be discharged from work is the worst that can
befall the operative. And what a dispiriting, unnerving influence this
uncertainty of his position in life, consequent upon the unceasing progress of
machinery, must exercise upon the worker, whose lot is precarious enough
without it! To escape despair, there are but two ways open to him; either
inward and outward revolt against the bourgeoisie or drunkenness and general
demoralisation. And the English operatives are accustomed to take refuge in
both. The history of the English proletariat relates hundreds of uprisings
against machinery and the bourgeoisie; we have already spoken of the moral
dissolution which, in itself, is only another form of despair. </p>
<p>The worst situation is that of those workers who have to compete against a
machine that is making its way. The price of the goods which they produce
adapts itself to the price of the kindred product of the machine, and as the
latter works more cheaply, its human competitor has but the lowest wages. The
same thing happens to every operative employed upon an old machine in
competition with later improvements. And who else is there to bear the
hardship? The manufacturer will not throw out his old apparatus, nor will he
sustain the loss upon it; out of the dead mechanism he can make nothing, so he
fastens upon the living worker, the universal scapegoat of society. Of all the
workers in competition with machinery, the most ill-used are the hand-loom
cotton weavers. They receive the most trifling wages, and, with full work, are
not in a position to earn more than ten shillings a week. One class of woven
goods after another is annexed by the power-loom, and hand-weaving is the last
refuge of workers thrown out of employment in other branches, so that the trade
is always overcrowded. Hence it comes that, in average seasons, the hand-weaver
counts himself fortunate if he can earn six or seven shillings a week, while to
reach this sum he must sit at his loom fourteen to eighteen hours a day. Most
woven goods require moreover a damp weaving-room, to keep the weft from
snapping, and in part for this reason, in part because of their poverty, which
prevents them from paying for better dwellings, the work-rooms of these weavers
are usually without wooden or paved floors. I have been in many dwellings of
such weavers, in remote, vile courts and alleys, usually in cellars. Often
half-a-dozen of these hand-loom weavers, several of them married, live together
in a cottage with one or two work-rooms, and one large sleeping-room. Their
food consists almost exclusively of potatoes, with perhaps oatmeal porridge,
rarely milk, and scarcely ever meat. Great numbers of them are Irish or of
Irish descent. And these poor hand-loom weavers, first to suffer from every
crisis, and last to be relieved from it, must serve the bourgeoisie as a handle
in meeting attacks upon the factory system. See, cries the bourgeois,
triumphantly, see how these poor creatures must famish, while the mill
operatives are thriving, and <i>then</i> judge the factory system! As though
it were not precisely the factory system and the machinery belonging to it
which had so shamefully crushed the hand-loom weavers, and as though the
bourgeoisie did not know this quite as well as ourselves! But the bourgeoisie
has interests at stake, and so a falsehood or two and a bit of hypocrisy
won’t matter much. </p>
<p>Let us examine somewhat more closely the fact that machinery more and more
supersedes the work of men. The human labour, involved in both spinning and
weaving, consists chiefly in piecing broken threads, as the machine does all
the rest. This work requires no muscular strength, but only flexibility of
finger. Men are, therefore, not only not needed for it, but actually, by reason
of the greater muscular development of the hand, less fit for it than women and
children, and are, therefore, naturally almost superseded by them. Hence, the
more the use of the arms, the expenditure of strength, can be transferred to
steam or waterpower, the fewer men need be employed; and as women and children
work more cheaply, and in these branches better than men, they take their
places. In the spinning-mills women and girls are to be found in almost
exclusive possession of the throstles; among the mules one man, an adult
spinner (with self-actors, he, too, becomes superfluous), and several piecers
for tying the threads, usually children or women, sometimes young men of from
eighteen to twenty years, here and there an old spinner <a href="#7" id="[7]"><sup class="enote">[7]</sup></a> thrown out of other employment. At
the power-looms women, from fifteen to twenty years, are chiefly employed, and
a few men; these, however, rarely remain at this trade after their twenty-first
year. Among the preparatory machinery, too, women alone are to be found, with
here and there a man to clean and sharpen the carding-frames. Besides all
these, the factories employ numbers of children – doffers – for
mounting and taking down bobbins, and a few men as overlookers, a mechanic and
an engineer for the steam- engines, carpenters, porters, etc.; but the actual
work of the mills is done by women and children. This the manufacturers deny.
</p>
<p>They published last year elaborate tables to prove that machinery does not
supersede adult male operatives. According to these tables, rather more than
half of all the factory-workers employed, viz., 52 per cent, were females and
48 per cent males, and of these operatives more than half were over eighteen
years old. So far, so good. But the manufacturers are very careful not to tell
us, how many of the adults were men and how many women. And this is just the
point. Besides this, they have evidently counted the mechanics, engineers,
carpenters, all the men employed in any way in the factories, perhaps even the
clerks, and still they have not the courage to tell the whole truth. These
publications teem generally with falsehoods, perversions, crooked statements,
with calculations of averages, that prove a great deal for the uninitiated
reader and nothing for the initiated, and with suppressions of facts bearing on
the most important points; and they prove only the selfish blindness and want
of uprightness of the manufacturers concerned. Let us take some of the
statements of a speech with which Lord Ashley introduced the Ten Hours’
Bill, March 15th, 1844, into the House of Commons. Here he gives some data as
to the relations of sex and age of the operatives, not yet refuted by the
manufacturers, whose statements, as quoted above, cover moreover only a part of
the manufacturing industry of England. Of 419,590 factory operatives of the
British Empire in 1839, 192,887, or nearly half, were under eighteen years of
age, and 242,296 of the female sex, of whom 112,192 were less than eighteen
years old. There remain, therefore, 80,695 male operatives under eighteen
years, and 96,599 adult male operatives, <i>or not one full quarter of the
whole number</i>. In the cotton factories, 56¼ per cent; in the woolen mills,
69½ per cent; in the silk mills, 70½ per cent; in the flax-spinning mills, 70½
per cent of all operatives are of the female sex. These numbers suffice to
prove the crowding out of adult males. But you have only to go into the nearest
mill to see the fact confirmed. Hence follows of necessity that inversion of
the existing social order which, being forced upon them, has the most ruinous
consequences for the workers. The employment of women at once breaks up the
family; for when the wife spends twelve or thirteen hours every day in the
mill, and the husband works the same length of time there or elsewhere, what
becomes of the children? They grow up like wild weeds; they are put out to
nurse for a shilling or eighteenpence a week, and how they are treated may be
imagined. Hence the accidents to which little children fall victims multiply in
the factory districts to a terrible extent. The lists of the Coroner of
Manchester <a href="#8" id="[8]"><sup class="enote">[8]</sup></a> showed for
nine months: 69 deaths from burning, 56 from drowning, 23 from falling, 67 from
other causes, or a total of 215 deaths from accidents,<a href="#9" id="[9]"><sup class="enote">[9]</sup></a> while in non-manufacturing
Liverpool during twelve months there were but 146 fatal accidents. The mining
accidents are excluded in both cases; and since the Coroner of Manchester has
no authority in Salford, the population of both places mentioned in the
comparison is about the same. The <i>Manchester Guardian</i> reports one or
more deaths by burning in almost every number. That the general mortality among
young children must be increased by the employment of the mothers is
self-evident, and is placed beyond all doubt by notorious facts. Women often
return to the mill three or four days after confinement, leaving the baby, of
course; in the dinner-hour they must hurry home to feed the child and eat
something, and what sort of suckling that can be is also evident. Lord Ashley
repeats the testimony of several workwomen: </p>
<p class="indentb">"M. H., twenty years old, has two children, the youngest a
baby that is tended by the other, a little older. The mother goes to the mill
shortly after five o’clock in the morning, and comes home at eight at
night; all day the milk pours from her breasts, so that her clothing drips with
it.” “H. W. has three children, goes away Monday morning at five
o’clock, and comes back Saturday evening; has so much to do for the
children then that she cannot get to bed before three o’clock in the
morning; often wet through to the skin, and obliged to work in that
state.” She said: “My breasts have given me the most frightful
pain, and I have been dripping wet with milk." </p>
<p class="fst">The use of narcotics to keep the children still is fostered by
this infamous system, and has reached a great extent in the factory districts.
Dr. Johns, Registrar in Chief for Manchester, is of opinion that this custom is
the chief source of the many deaths from convulsions. The employment of the
wife dissolves the family utterly and of necessity, and this dissolution, in
our present society, which is based upon the family, brings the most
demoralising consequences for parents as well as children. A mother who has no
time to trouble herself about her child, to perform the most ordinary loving
services for it during its first year, who scarcely indeed sees it, can be no
real mother to the child, must inevitably grow indifferent to it, treat it
unlovingly like a stranger. The children who grow up under such conditions are
utterly ruined for later family life, can never feel at home in the family
which they themselves found, because they have always been accustomed to
isolation, and they contribute therefore to the already general undermining of
the family in the working-class. A similar dissolution of the family is brought
about by the employment of the children. When they get on far enough to earn
more than they cost their parents from week to week, they begin to pay the
parents a fixed sum for board and lodging, and keep the rest for themselves.
This often happens from the fourteenth or fifteenth year. In a word, the
children emancipate themselves, and regard the paternal dwelling as a
lodging-house, which they often exchange for another, as suits them. </p>
<p>In many cases the family is not wholly dissolved by the employment of the
wife, but turned upside down. The wife supports the family, the husband sits at
home, tends the children, sweeps the room and cooks. This case happens very
frequently; in Manchester alone, many hundred such men could be cited,
condemned to domestic occupations. It is easy to imagine the wrath aroused
among the working-men by this reversal of all relations within the family,
while the other social conditions remain unchanged. There lies before me a
letter from an English working-man, Robert Pounder, Baron’s Buildings,
Woodhouse, Moorside, in Leeds (the bourgeoisie may hunt him up there; I give
the exact address for the purpose), written by him to Oastler. </p>
<p>He relates how another working-man, being on tramp, came to St. Helens, in
Lancashire, and there looked up an old friend. He found him in a miserable,
damp cellar, scarcely furnished. </p>
<p class="indentb">"And when my poor friend went in, there sat poor Jack near
the fire, and what did he, think you? Why he sat and mended his wife’s
stockings with the bodkin; and as soon as he saw his old friend at the
door-post, he tried to hide them. But Joe, that is my friend’s name, had
seen it, and said: ’Jack, what the devil art thou doing? Where is the
missus? Why, is that thy work?’ and poor Jack was ashamed, and said:
’No, I know this is not my work, but my poor missus is i’ th’
factory; she has to leave at half-past five and works till eight at night, and
then she is so knocked up that she cannot do aught when she gets home, so I
have to do everything for her what I can, for I have no work, nor had any for
more nor three years, and I shall never have any more work while I live,”
and then he wept a big tear. Jack again said: ’There is work enough for
women folks and childer hereabouts, but none for men: thou mayest sooner find a
hundred pound on the road than work for men – but I should never have
believed that either thou or any one else would have seen me mending my
wife’s stockings, for it is bad work. But she can hardly stand on her
feet; I am afraid she will be laid up, and then I don’t know what is to
become of us, for it’s a good bit that she has been the man in the haul
and I the woman; it is bad work, Joe,” and he cried bitterly, and said,
’It has not been always so.’ ’No,’ said Joe; ’but
when thou hadn’t no work, how hast thou not shifted ’I’ll
tell thee, Joe, as well as I can, but it was bad enough; thou knowest when I
got married I had work plenty, and thou knows I was not lazy.’ ’No,
that thou wert not.’ ’And we had a good furnished house, and Mary
need not go to work. I could work for the two of us; but now the world is
upside down. Mary has to work and I have to stop at home, mind the childer,
sweep and wash, bake and mend; and, when the poor woman comes home at night,
she is knocked up. Thou knows, Joe, it’s hard for one that was used
different.’ ’Yes, boy, it is hard.’ And then Jack began to
cry again, and he wished he had never married, and that he had never been born;
but he had never thought, when he wed Mary, that it would come to this.
’I have often cried over it,’ said Jack. Now when Joe heard this,
he told me that he had cursed and damned the factories, and the masters, and
the Government, with all the curses that he had learned while be was in the
factory from a child." </p>
<p class="fst">Can any one imagine a more insane state of things than that
described in this letter! And yet this condition, which unsexes the man and
takes from the woman all womanliness without being able to bestow upon the man
true womanliness, or the woman true manliness – this condition which
degrades, in the most shameful way, both sexes, and, through them, Humanity, is
the last result of our much-praised civilisation, the final achievement of all
the efforts and struggles of hundreds of generations to improve their own
situation and that of their posterity. We must either despair of mankind, and
its aims and efforts, when we see all our labour and toil result in such a
mockery, or we must admit that human society has hitherto sought salvation in a
false direction; we must admit that so total a reversal of the position of the
sexes can have come to pass only because the sexes have been placed in a false
position from the beginning. If the reign of the wife over the husband, as
inevitably brought about by the factory system, is inhuman, the pristine rule
of the husband over the wife must have been inhuman too. If the wife can now
base her supremacy upon the fact that she supplies the greater part, nay, the
whole of the common possession, the necessary inference is that this community
of possession is no true and rational one, since one member of the family
boasts offensively of contributing the greater share. If the family of our
present society is being thus dissolved, this dissolution merely shows that, at
bottom, the binding tie of this family was not family affection, but private
interest lurking under the cloak of a pretended community of possessions. <a href="#10" id="[10]"><sup class="enote">[10]</sup></a> The same relation
exists on the part of those children who support unemployed parents when they
do not directly pay board as already referred to. Dr. Hawkins testified in the
Factories’ Inquiry Commission’s Report that this relation is common
enough, and in Manchester it is notorious. In this case the children are the
masters in the house, as the wife was in the former case, and Lord Ashley gives
an example of this in his speech: A man berated his two daughters for going to
the public-house, and they answered that they were tired of being ordered
about, saying, “Damn you, we have to keep you.” Determined to keep
the proceeds of their work for themselves, they left the family dwelling, and
abandoned their parents to their fate. </p>
<p>The unmarried women, who have grown up in mills, are no better off than the
married ones. It is self-evident that a girl who has worked in a mill from her
ninth year is in no position to understand domestic work, whence it follows
that female operatives prove wholly inexperienced and unfit as housekeepers.
They cannot knit or sew, cook or wash, are unacquainted with the most ordinary
duties of a housekeeper, and when they have young children to take care of,
have not the vaguest idea how to set about it. The Factories’ Inquiry
Commission’s Report gives dozens of examples of this, and Dr. Hawkins,
Commissioner for Lancashire expresses his opinion as follows: </p>
<p class="indentb">“A girl marries early and recklessly; she has had no
time, no means, no opportunities of learning the common duties of domestic
life; and even if she had acquired the knowledge she has still no time to
practise them... There is the young mother absent from her child above twelve
hours daily. Who has the charge of the infant in her absence? Usually some
little girl or aged woman, who is hired for a trifle and whose services are
equivalent to the reward. Too often the dwelling of the factory family is no
home; it sometimes is a cellar, which includes no cooking, no washing, no
making, no mending, no decencies of life, no invitations to the fireside. I
cannot help on these and on other grounds, especially for the better
preservation of infant life, expressing my hope that a period may arrive when
married women shall be rarely employed in a factory.” </p>
<p class="fst">But that is the least of the evil. The moral consequences of the
employment of women in factories are even worse. The collecting of persons of
both sexes and all ages in a single work-room, the inevitable contact, the
crowding into a small space of people, to whom neither mental nor moral
education has been given, is not calculated for the favourable development of
the female character. The manufacturer, if he pays any attention to the matter,
can interfere only when something scandalous actually happens; the permanent,
less conspicuous influence of persons of dissolute character upon the more
moral, and especially upon the younger ones, he cannot ascertain, and
consequently cannot prevent. But precisely this influence is the injurious. The
language used in the mills is characterised by many witnesses in the report of
1833, as "indecent", “bad", “filthy", etc. It is the same process
upon a small scale which we have already witnessed upon a large one in the
great cities. The centralisation of population has the same influence upon the
same persons, whether it affects them in a great city or a small factory. The
smaller the mill the closer the packing, and the more unavoidable the contact;
and the consequences are not wanting. A witness in Leicester said that he would
rather let his daughter beg than go into a factory; that they are perfect gates
of hell; that most of the prostitutes of the town had their employment in the
mills to thank for their present situation. Another, in Manchester, “did
not hesitate to assert that three-fourths of the young factory employees, from
fourteen to twenty years of age, were unchaste". Commissioner Cowell expresses
it as his opinion, that the morality of the factory operatives is somewhat
below the average of that of the working- class in general. And Dr. Hawkins
says: </p>
<p class="indentb">“An estimate of sexual morality is scarcely possible
to be reduce into figures; but if I may trust my own observations, and the
general opinion of those with whom I have conversed, and the spirit of our
evidence, then a most discouraging view of the influence of the factory life
upon the morality of female youth obtrudes itself.”</p>
<p class="fst">It is, besides, a matter of course that factory servitude, like
any other, and to an even higher degree, confers the <i>jus primae noctis</i>
upon the master. In this respect also the employer is sovereign over the
persons and charms of his employees. The threat of discharge suffices to
overcome all resistance in nine cases out of ten, if not in ninety-nine out of
a hundred, in girls who, in any case, have no strong inducements to chastity.
If the master is mean enough, and the official report mentions several such
cases, his mill is also his harem; and the fact that not all manufacturers use
their power, does not in the least change the position of the girls. In the
beginning of manufacturing industry, when most of the employers were upstarts
without education or consideration for the hypocrisy of society, they let
nothing interfere with the exercise of their vested rights. </p>
<p>To form a correct judgment of the influence of factory-work upon the health
of the female sex, it is necessary first to consider the work of children, and
then the nature of the work itself. From the beginning of manufacturing
industry, children have been employed in mills, at first almost exclusively by
reason of the smallness of the machines, which were later enlarged. Even
children from the workhouses were employed in multitudes, being rented out for
a number of years to the manufacturers as apprentices. They were lodged, fed,
and clothed in common, and were, of course, completely the slaves of their
masters, by whom they were treated with the utmost recklessness and barbarity.
As early as 1796, the public objection to this revolting system found such
vigorous expression through Dr. Percival and Sir Robert Peel (father of the
Cabinet Minister, and himself a cotton manufacturer), that in 1802 Parliament
passed an Apprentices’ Bill, by which the most crying evils were removed.
Gradually the increasing competition of free workpeople crowded out the whole
apprentice system; factories were built in cities, machinery was constructed on
a larger scale, and work-rooms were made more airy and wholesome; gradually,
too, more work was found for adults and young persons. The number of children
in the mills diminished somewhat, and the age at which they began to work rose
a little; few children under eight or nine years were now employed. Later, as
we shall see, the power of the state intervened several times to protect them
from the money-greed of the bourgeoisie. </p>
<p>The great mortality among children of the working-class, and especially
among those of the factory operatives, is proof enough of the unwholesome
conditions under which they pass their first years. These influences are at
work, of course, among the children who survive, but not quite so powerfully as
upon those who succumb. The result in the most favourable case is a tendency to
disease, or some check in development, and consequent less than normal vigour
of the constitution. A nine years old child of a factory operative that has
grown up in want, privation, and changing conditions, in cold and damp, with
insufficient clothing and unwholesome dwellings, is far from having the working
force of a child brought up under healthier conditions. At nine years of age it
is sent into the mill to work 6½ hours (formerly 8, earlier still, 12 to 14,
even 16 hours) daily, until the thirteenth year; then twelve hours until the
eighteenth year. The old enfeebling influences continue, while the work is
added to them. It is not to be denied that a child of nine years, even an
operative’s child, can hold out through 6½ hours’ daily work,
without any one being able to trace visible bad results in its development
directly to this cause; but in no case can its presence in the damp, heavy air
of the factory, often at once warm and wet, contribute to good health; and, in
any case, it is unpardonable to sacrifice to the greed of an unfeeling
bourgeoisie the time of children which should be devoted solely to their
physical and mental development, withdraw them from school and the fresh air,
in order to wear them for the benefit of the manufacturers. The bourgeoisie
says: If we do not employ the children in the mills, they only remain under
conditions unfavourable to their development; and this is true on the whole.
But what does this mean if it is not a confession that the bourgeoisie first
places the children of the working-class under unfavourable conditions, and
then exploits these bad conditions for its own benefit, appeals to that which
is as much its own fault as the factory system, excuses the sin of today with
the sin of yesterday? And if the Factory Act did not in some measure fetter
their hands, how this “humane", this “benevolent”
bourgeoisie, which has built its factories solely for the good of the
working-class, would take care of the interests of these workers! Let us hear
how they acted before the factory inspector was at their heels. Their own
admitted testimony shall convict them in the Report of the Factories’
Inquiry Commission of 1833. </p>
<p>The report of the Central Commission relates that the manufacturers began to
employ children rarely of five years, often of six, very often of seven,
usually of eight to nine years; that the working-day often lasted fourteen to
sixteen hours, exclusive of meals and intervals; that the manufacturers
permitted overlookers to flog and maltreat children, and often took an active
part in so doing themselves. One case is related of a Scotch manufacturer, who
rode after a sixteen years old runaway, forced him to return, running after the
employer as fast as the master’s horse trotted, and beat him the whole
way with a long whip. In the large towns where the operatives resisted more
vigorously, such things naturally happened less often. But even this long
working-day failed to satisfy the greed of the capitalists. Their aim was to
make the capital invested in the building and machinery produce the highest
return, by every available means, to make it work as actively as possible.
Hence the manufacturers introduced the shameful system of night-work. Some of
them employed two sets of operatives, each numerous enough to fill the whole
mill, and let one set work the twelve hours of the day, and the other the
twelve hours of the night. It is needless to picture the effect upon the frames
of young children, and even upon the health of young persons and adults,
produced by permanent loss of sleep at night, which cannot be made good by any
amount of sleep during the day. Irritation of the whole nervous system, with
general lassitude and enfeeblement of the entire frame, were the inevitable
results, with the fostering of temptation to drunkenness and unbridled sexual
indulgence. One manufacturer testifies that during the two years in which
night-work was carried on in his factory, the number of illegitimate children
born was doubled, and such general demoralisation prevailed that he was obliged
to give up night-work. Other manufacturers were yet more barbarous, requiring
many hands to work thirty to forty hours at a stretch, several times a week,
letting them get a couple of hours sleep only, because the night-shift was not
complete, but calculated to replace a part of the operatives only. </p>
<p>The reports of the Commission touching this barbarism surpass everything
that is known to me in this line. Such infamies, as are here related, are
nowhere else to be found – yet we shall see that the bourgeoisie
constantly appeals to the testimony of the Commission as being in its own
favour. The consequences of these cruelties became evident quickly enough. The
Commissioners mention a crowd of cripples who appeared before them, who clearly
owed their distortion to the long working-hours. This distortion usually
consists of a curving of the spinal column and legs, and is described as
follows by Francis Sharp, M.R.C.S., of Leeds: </p>
<p class="indentb">"Before I came to Leeds, I had never seen the peculiar
twisting of the ends of the lower part of the thigh bone. At first I considered
it might be rickets, but from the numbers which presented themselves,
particularly at an age beyond the time when rickets attack children (between 8
and 14), and finding that they had commenced since they began work at the
factory I soon began to change my opinion. I now may have seen of such cases
nearly 100, and I can most decidedly state they were the result of too much
labour. So far as I know they all belong to factories, and have attributed
their disease to this cause themselves.” “Of distortions of the
spine, which were evidently owing to the long standing at their labour, perhaps
the number of cases might not be less than 300." </p>
<p class="fst">Precisely similar is the testimony of Dr. Hey, for eighteen
years physician in the hospital in Leeds: </p>
<p class="indentb">"Diseases of the spine amongst people employed in factories
presented themselves very frequently. Some were the result of pure labour;
others were the result of labour on a constitution perhaps congenitally weak,
or rendered feeble by bad food. The deformities of the limbs appear to be more
frequent than the spinal diseases... the bending in of the knees, relaxation of
the ligaments of the ankles was very frequent, and the bending of the large
bones. The heads of the large bones have especially been increased and twisted
to a considerable extent; and these cases I have found to have come from those
mills and factories where long hours have been said to be common." </p>
<p class="fst">Surgeons Beaumont and Sharp, of Bradford, bear the same
testimony. The reports of Drinkwater, Power, and Dr. Loudon contain a multitude
of examples of such distortions, and those of Tufnell and Sir David Barry,
which are less directed to this point, give single examples. The Commissioners
for Lancashire, Cowell, Tufnell, and Hawkins, have almost wholly neglected this
aspect of the physiological results of the factory system, though this district
rivals Yorkshire in the number of cripples. I have seldom traversed Manchester
without meeting three or four of them, suffering from precisely the same
distortions of the spinal columns and legs as that described, and I have often
been able to observe them closely. I know one personally who corresponds
exactly with the foregoing description of Dr. Hey, and who got into this
condition in Mr. Douglas’ factory in Pendleton, an establishment which
enjoys an unenviable notoriety among the operatives by reason of the former
long working periods continued night after night. It is evident, at a glance,
whence the distortions of these cripples come; they all look exactly alike. The
knees are bent inward and backwards, the ankles deformed and thick, and the
spinal column often bent forwards or to one side. But the crown belongs to the
philanthropic manufacturers of the Macclesfield silk district. They employed
the youngest children of all, even from five to six years of age. In the
supplementary testimony of Commissioner Tufnell, I find the statement of a
certain factory manager Wright, both of whose sisters were most shamefully
crippled, and who had once counted the cripples in several streets, some of
them the cleanest and neatest streets of Macclesfield. He found in Townley
Street ten, George Street five, Charlotte Street four, Watercots fifteen, Bank
Top three, Lord Street seven, Mill Lane twelve, Great George Street two, in the
workhouse two, Park Green one, Peckford Street two, whose families all
unanimously declared that the cripples had become such in consequence of
overwork in the silk-twisting mills. One boy is mentioned so crippled as not to
be able to go upstairs, and girls deformed in back and hips. </p>
<p>Other deformities also have proceeded from this overwork, especially
flattening of the foot, which Sir D. Barry frequently observed, as did the
physicians and surgeons in Leeds. In cases, in which a stronger constitution,
better food, and other more favourable circumstances enabled the young
operative to resist this effect of a barbarous exploitation, we find, at least,
pain in the back, hips, and legs, swollen joints, varicose veins, and large,
persistent ulcers in the thighs and calves. These affections are almost
universal among the operatives. The reports of Stuart, Mackintosh, and Sir D.
Barry contain hundreds of examples; indeed, they know almost no operative who
did not suffer from some of these affections; and in the remaining reports, the
occurrence of the same phenomena is attested by many physicians.</p>
<hr class="section"/>
<p class="fst">The reports covering Scotland place it beyond all doubt, that a
working-day of thirteen hours, even for men and women from eighteen to
twenty-two years of age, produces at least these consequences, both in the
flax-spinning mills of Dundee and Dunfermline, and in the cotton mills of
Glasgow and Lanark.</p>
<p>All these affections are easily explained by the nature of factory-work,
which is, as the manufacturers say, very “light", and precisely by reason
of its lightness, more enervating than any other. The operatives have little to
do, but must stand the whole time. Any one who sits down, say upon a
window-ledge or a basket, is fined, and this perpetual upright position, this
constant mechanical pressure of the upper portions of the body upon spinal
column, hips, and legs, inevitably produces the results mentioned. This
standing is not required by the work itself, and at Nottingham chairs have been
introduced, with the result that these affections disappeared, and the
operatives ceased to object to the length of the working-day. But in a factory
where the operative works solely for the bourgeois, and has small interest in
doing his work well, he would probably use the seats more than would be
agreeable and profitable to the manufacturer; and in order that somewhat less
raw material may be spoiled for the bourgeois, the operative must sacrifice
health and strength. This long protracted upright position, with the bad
atmosphere prevalent in the mills, entails, besides the deformities mentioned,
a marked relaxation of all vital energies, and, in consequence, all sorts of
other affections general rather than local. The atmosphere of the factories is,
as a rule, at once damp and warm, usually warmer than is necessary, and, when
the ventilation is not <i>very</i> good, impure, heavy, deficient in oxygen,
filled with dust and the smell of the machine oil, which almost everywhere
smears the floor, sinks into it, and becomes rancid. The operatives are lightly
clad by reason of the warmth, and would readily take cold in case of
irregularity of the temperature; a draught is distasteful to them, the general
enervation which gradually takes possession of all the physical functions
diminishes the animal warmth: this must be replaced from without, and nothing
is therefore more agreeable to the operative than to have all the doors and
windows closed, and to stay in his warm factory air. Then comes the sudden
change of temperature on going out into the cold and wet or frosty atmosphere,
without the means of protection from the rain, or of changing wet clothing for
dry, a circumstance which perpetually produces colds. And when one reflects
that, with all this, not one single muscle of the body is really exercised,
really called into activity, except perhaps those of the legs; that nothing
whatsoever counteracts the enervating, relaxing tendency of all these
conditions; that every influence is wanting which might give the muscles
strength, the fibres elasticity and consistency; that from youth up, the
operative is deprived of all fresh-air recreation, it is impossible to wonder
at the almost unanimous testimony of the physicians in the Factories’
Report, that they find a great lack of ability to resist disease, a general
depression in vital activity, a constant relaxation of the mental and physical
powers. Let us hear Sir D. Barry first:</p>
<p class="indentb">The unfavourable influences of mill-work upon the hands are
the following: “(1) The indispensable necessity of forcing both their
mental and bodily exertions to keep exact pace with the motions of machinery
propelled by an unvarying, unceasing power. (2) The continuance of an erect
posture for periods unnaturally prolonged and too quickly repeated. (3) The
privation of sleep" (in consequence of too long working-hours, pain in the
legs, and general physical derangement). “To these causes are often added
low, crowded, dusty, or damp rooms; impure air, heated atmospheres, constant
perspiration. Hence it is that male children particularly, after they have
worked some time in mills lose – with very few exceptions indeed –
the rosy chubbiness of boyhood, and become paler and thinner than boys not so
employed generally are. Even the draw-boy who stands with his bare feet on the
earthen floor of his master’s shop preserves his appearance much better
than the mill-boys,” because he occasionally goes into the fresh air for
a time. “But the mill-worker never has a moment’s respite except at
meals, and never gets into the open air except when he is going to look for
them. All the adult male spinners are pale and thin; they are subject to
capricious appetite and dyspepsia; all the spinners have been brought up in the
mills from their very childhood, it is fair to conclude that their mode of life
is not favourable to the development of the manly forms, seeing that few, or
none of them are tall athletic men. Females are much less deteriorated in their
appearance by mill-work than males.” (Very naturally. But we shall see
that they have their own diseases.)</p>
<p class="fst">So, too, Power:</p>
<p class="indentb">"I can have no hesitation in stating my belief that a large
mass of deformity has been produced at Bradford by the factory system.... The
effect of long and continuous work upon the frame and limbs is not indicated by
actual deformity alone; a more common indication of it is found in a stunted
growth, relaxed muscles, and slender conformation."</p>
<p class="fst">So, too, F. Sharp, in Leeds, the surgeon <a href="#11" id="[11]"><sup class="enote">[11]</sup></a> already quoted:</p>
<p class="indentb">When I moved from Scarborough to Leeds, “the general
appearance of the children in Leeds immediately struck me as much more pallid,
and also the firmness of the fibre as much inferior as what I had seen in
Scarborough and the adjacent country. Observed also many to be more diminutive
for their age.... Innumerable cases of scrofula, affections of the lungs,
mesenteric diseases, and dyspepsia, have also occurred, which I have no doubt,
as a professional man, were owing to the same cause", the mill-work. “The
nervous energy of the body I consider to be weakened by the very long hours,
and a foundation laid for many diseases. Were it not for the individuals who
join the mills from the country, the factory people would soon be
deteriorated." </p>
<p class="fst">So, too, Beaumont, surgeon in Bradford: </p>
<p class="indentb">“I also consider the system of working in the
factories in and around here induces for the most part a peculiar laxity of the
whole system, rendering the children highly susceptible of either prevailing
epidemics or casual medical disorders.... I certainly consider the want of
wholesome regulations in the most of the factories, whether as to ventilation
or cleanliness, to be productive in a great measure of that peculiar tendency
or susceptibility of morbid affections of which my own practice affords ample
experience." </p>
<p class="fst">Similar testimony is borne by Dr. Hey[Not Hey, but William Sharp
Jr (per "Factories Inquiry Commission", Second Report, 1833, C. 3, p. 23)]: </p>
<p class="indentb">(1) “I have had an opportunity of observing the effect
of the factory system in the health of children under the most advantageous
circumstances” (in Wood’s mill, in Bradford, the best arranged of
the district, in which he was factory surgeon). (2) “This effect is
decidedly. and, to a great extent, injurious, even under those favourable
circumstances. (3) During the year 1832, three-fifths of all the children
employed in Wood’s mill had medical assistance from me; (4) The most
injurious effect is not in the prevalency of deformed bodies, but debilitated
and diseased constitutions,” (3) All this is greatly improved since the
working-hours of children have been reduced at Wood’s to ten. </p>
<p class="fst">The Commissioner, Dr. Loudon himself, who sites these witnesses,
says: </p>
<p class="indentb">"I think it has been clearly proved that children have been
worked a most unreasonable and cruel length of time daily, and that even adults
have been expected to do a certain quantity of labour which scarcely any human
being is able to endure. The result of this has been, that many have met with a
premature death; many have been affected constitutionally for life; and the
idea of a posterity being injured from the shattered frames of the survivors
is, physiologically speaking, but too well founded." </p>
<p class="fst">And, finally, Dr. Hawkins, in speaking of Manchester: </p>
<p class="indentb">"I believe that most travellers are struck by the lowness of
stature, the leanness, and the paleness which present themselves so commonly to
the eye at Manchester, and above all, among the factory classes. I have never
been in any town in Great Britain nor in Europe in which degeneracy of form and
colour from the national standard has been so obvious. The married women fall
remarkably short of the usual characteristics of the English wife.... I cannot
help remarking, that the boys and girls whom I examined from the Manchester
factories very generally exhibited a depressed look, and a pallid complexion;
none of the alacrity, activity, and hilarity of early life shone on their
countenances and gestures. A large number of both, in reply to my questions,
declared that they had no wish to play about on the Saturday afternoon and on
the Sunday, but that they preferred remaining quiet." </p>
<p class="fst">I add, at once, another passage of Hawkins’ report, which
only half belongs here, but may be quoted here as well as anywhere else: </p>
<p class="indentb">"Intemperance, debauchery and improvidence are the chief
blemishes on the character of the factory workpeople, and those evils may
easily be traced to habits formed under the present system, and springing from
it almost inevitably. On all sides it is admitted that indigestion,
hypochondriasis and languor affect this class of the population very widely.
After twelve hours of monotonous labour, it is but too natural to seek for
stimulants of one kind or another; but when we superadd the morbid states above
alluded to, the transition to spirits is rapid and perpetual." </p>
<p class="fst">For all this testimony of the physicians and commissioners, the
report itself offers hundreds of cases of proof. That the growth of young
operatives is stunted, by their work, hundreds of statements testify; among
others, Cowell gives the weight of 46 youths of 17 years of age, from one
Sunday school, of whom 26 employed in mills, averaged 104.5 pounds, and 20 not
employed in mills, 117.7 pounds. One of the largest manufacturers of
Manchester, leader of the opposition against the working-men, I think Robert
Hyde Greg himself, said, on one occasion, that if things went on as at present,
the operatives of Lancashire would soon be a race of pygmies. A recruiting
officer testified that operatives are little adapted for military service,
looked thin and nervous, and were frequently rejected by the surgeons as unfit.
In Manchester he could hardly get men of five feet eight inches; they were
usually only five feet six to seven, whereas in the agricultural districts,
most of the recruits were five feet eight. </p>
<p>The men wear out very early in consequence of the conditions under which
they live and work. Most of them are unfit for work at forty years, a few hold
out to forty-five, almost none to fifty years of age. This is caused not only
by the general enfeeblement of the frame, but also very often by a failure of
the sight, which is a result of mule-spinning, in which the operative is
obliged to fix his gaze upon a long row of fine, parallel threads, and so
greatly to, strain the sight. </p>
<p>Of 1,600 operatives employed in several factories in Harpur and Lanark, but
10 were over 45 years of age; of 22,094 operatives in diverse factories in
Stockport and Manchester, but 145 were over 45 years old. Of these 143, 16 were
retained as a special favour, and one was doing the work of a child. A list of
131 spinners contained but seven over 45 years, and yet the whole 131 were
rejected by the manufacturers, to whom they applied for work, as “too
old",’ and were without means of support by reason of old age! Mr.
Ashworth, a large manufacturer, admits in a letter to Lord Ashley, that,
towards the fortieth year, the spinners can no longer prepare the required
quantity of yarn, and are therefore ’sometimes” discharged; he
calls operatives forty years of age “old people"! Commissioner Mackintosh
expresses himself in the same way in the report of 1833: </p>
<p class="indentb">“Although prepared by seeing childhood occupied in
such a manner, it is very difficult to believe the age of the men advanced in
years as given by themselves, so complete is their premature old age." </p>
<p class="fst">Surgeon Smellie of Glasgow, who treated operatives chiefly, says
hat forty years is old age for them. And similar evidence may be found
elsewhere. In Manchester, this premature old age among the operatives is so
universal that almost every man of forty would be taken for ten to fifteen
years older, while the prosperous classes, men as well as women, preserve their
appearance exceedingly well if they do not drink too heavily. </p>
<p>The influence of factory-work upon the female physique also is marked and
peculiar. The deformities entailed by long hours of work are much more serious
among women. Protracted work frequently causes deformities of the pelvis,
partly in the shape of abnormal position and development of the hip bones,
partly of malformation of the lower portion of the spinal column, </p>
<p class="indentb">"Although,” says Dr. Loudon in his report, “no
cases presented themselves of deformed pelvis, and some others of the diseases
which have been described, yet their ailments are such as every medical man
must expect to be the probable consequences” of such working-hours for
young people, “and they are recorded by men of the highest professional
and moral character".</p>
<p class="fst">That factory operatives undergo more difficult confinement than
other women is testified to by several midwives and accoucheurs, and also that
they are more liable to miscarriage. Moreover, they suffer from the general
enfeeblement common to all operatives, and, when pregnant, continue to work in
the factory up to the hour of delivery, because otherwise they lose their wages
and are made to fear that they may be replaced if they stop away too soon. It
frequently happens that women are at work one evening and delivered the next
morning, and the case is none too rare of their being delivered in the factory
among the machinery. And if the gentlemen of the bourgeoisie find nothing
particularly shocking in this, their wives will perhaps admit that it is a
piece of cruelty, an infamous act of barbarism, indirectly to force a pregnant
woman to work twelve or thirteen hours daily (formerly still longer), up to the
day of her delivery; in a standing position, with frequent stoopings. But this
is not all. If these women are not obliged to resume work within two weeks,
they are thankful, and count themselves fortunate. Many come back to the
factory after eight, and even after three to four days, to resume full work. I
once heard a manufacturer ask an overlooker; “Is so and so not back
yet?” “No.” “How long since she was confined.”
“A week." "She might surely have been back long ago. That one over there
only stays three days.” Naturally, fear of being discharged, dread of
starvation drives her to the factory in spite of her weakness, in defiance of
her pain. The interest of the manufacturer will not brook that his employees
stay at home by reason of illness; they must not be ill, they must not venture
to lie still through a long confinement, or he must stop his machinery or
trouble his supreme head with a temporary change of arrangements; and rather
than do this, he discharges his people when they begin to be ill. Listen: </p>
<p class="indentb">A girl feels very ill, can scarcely do her work. “Why
don’t you ask for leave to stay away?” “Well, sir, the master
is queer at letting us off; if we are off a quarter of a day we stand a chance
of being turned away." </p>
<p class="fst">Or Sir D. Barry: </p>
<p class="indentb">Thomas McDurt, workman, has slight fever. “Cannot
venture to be off work more than four days, for fear of losing his work." </p>
<p>And so it goes on in almost all the factories. The employment of young girls
produces all sorts of irregularities during the period of development. In some,
especially those who are better fed, the heat of the factories hastens this
process, so that in single cases, girls of thirteen and fourteen are wholly
mature. Roberton, whom I have already cited (mentioned in the Factories’
Inquiry Commission’s Report as the “eminent” gynaecologist of
Manchester), relates in the <i>North of England Medical and Surgical
Journal</i>, that he had seen a girl of eleven years who was not only a wholly
developed woman, but pregnant, and that it was by no means rare in Manchester
for women to be confined at fifteen years of age). In such cases, the influence
of the warmth of the factories is the same as that of a tropical climate, and,
as in such climates, the abnormally early development revenges itself by
correspondingly premature age and debility. On the other hand, retarded
development of the female constitution occurs, the breasts mature late or not
at all. Menstruation first appears in the seventeenth or eighteenth, sometimes
in the twentieth year, and is often wholly wanting. Irregular menstruation,
coupled with great pain and numerous affections, especially with anaemia, is
very frequent, as the medical reports unanimously state. </p>
<p>Children of such mothers, particularly of those who are obliged to work
during pregnancy, cannot be vigorous. They are, on the contrary, described in
the report, especially in Manchester, as very feeble; and Barry alone asserts
that they are healthy, but says further, that in Scotland, where his inspection
lay, almost no married women worked in factories. Moreover, most of the
factories there are in the country (with the exception of Glasgow), a
circumstance which contributes greatly to the invigoration of the children. The
operatives’ children in the neighbourhood of Manchester are nearly all
thriving and rosy, while those within the city look pale and scrofulous; but
with the ninth year the colour vanishes suddenly, because all are then sent
into the factories, when it soon becomes impossible to distinguish the country
from the city children. </p>
<p>But besides all this, there are some branches of factory-work which have an
especially injurious effect. In many rooms of the cotton and flax-spinning
mills, the air is filled with fibrous dust, which produces chest affections,
especially among workers in the carding and combing-rooms. Some constitutions
can bear it, some cannot; but the operative has no choice. He must take the
room in which he finds work, whether his chest is sound or not. The most common
effects of this breathing of dust are blood-spitting, hard, noisy breathing,
pains in the chest, coughs, sleeplessness – in short, all the symptoms of
asthma ending in the worst cases in consumption. Especially unwholesome is the
wet spinning of linen-yarn which is carried on by young girls and boys. The
water spurts over them from the spindle, so that the front of their clothing is
constantly wet through to the skin; and there is always water standing on the
floor. This is the case to a less degree in the doubling-rooms of the cotton
mills, and the result is a constant succession of colds and affections of the
chest. A hoarse, rough voice is common to all operatives, but especially to wet
spinners and doublers. Stuart, Mackintosh, and Sir D. Barry express themselves
in the most vigorous terms as to the unwholesomeness of this work, and the
small consideration shown by most of the manufacturers for the health of the
girls who do it. Another effect of flax-spinning is a peculiar deformity of the
shoulder, especially a projection of the right shoulder-blade, consequent upon
the nature of the work. This sort of spinning and the throstle-spinning of
cotton frequently produce diseases of the knee-pan, which is used to check the
spindle during the joining of broken threads. The frequent stooping and the
bending to the low machines common to both these branches of work have, in
general, a stunting effect upon the growth of the operative. In the
throstle-room of the cotton mill at Manchester, in which I was employed, I do
not remember to have seen one single tall, well-built girl; they were all
short, dumpy, and badly-formed, decidedly ugly in the whole development of the
figure. But apart from all these diseases and malformations, the limbs of the
operatives suffer in still another way. The work between the machinery gives
rise to multitudes of accidents of more or less serious nature, which have for
the operative the secondary effect of unfitting him for his work more or less
completely. The most common accident is the squeezing off of a single joint of
a finger, somewhat less common the loss of the whole finger, half or a whole
hand, an arm, etc., in the machinery. Lockjaw very often follows, even upon the
lesser among these injuries, and brings death with it. Besides the deformed
persons, a great number of maimed ones may be seen going about in Manchester;
this one has lost an arm or a part of one, that one a foot, the third half a
leg; it is like living in the midst of an army just returned from a campaign.
But the most dangerous portion of the machinery is the strapping which conveys
motive power from the shaft to the separate machines, especially if it contains
buckles, which, however, are rarely used now. Whoever is seized by the strap is
carried up with lightning speed, thrown against the ceiling above and floor
below with such force that there is rarely a whole bone left in the body, and
death follows instantly. Between June 12th and August 3rd, 1844, the
<i>Manchester Guardian</i> reported the following serious accidents (the
trifling ones it does not notice): June 12th, a boy died in Manchester of
lockjaw, caused by his hand being crushed between wheels. June 15th, a youth in
Saddleworth seized by a wheel and carried away with it; died, utterly mangled.
June 29th, a young man at Green Acres Moor, near Manchester, at work in a
machine shop, fell under the grindstone, which broke two of his ribs and
lacerated him terribly. July 24th, a girl in Oldham died, carried around fifty
times by a strap; no bone unbroken. July 27th, a girl in Manchester seized by
the blower (the first machine that receives the raw cotton), and died of
injuries received. August 3rd, a bobbins turner died in Dukenfield, caught in a
strap, every rib broken. In the year 1842, the Manchester Infirmary treated 962
cases of wounds and mutilations caused by machinery, while the number of all
other accidents within the district of the hospital was 2,426, so that for five
accidents from all other causes, two were caused by machinery. The accidents
which happened in Salford are not included here, nor those treated by surgeons
in private practice. In such cases, whether or not the accident unfits the
victim for further work, the employer, at best, pays the doctor, or, in very
exceptional cases, he may pay wages during treatment; what becomes of the
operative afterwards, in case he cannot work, is no concern of the employer.
</p>
<p>The Factory Report says on this subject, that employers must be made
responsible for all cases, since children cannot take care, and adults will
take care in their own interest. But the gentlemen who write the report are
bourgeois, and so they must contradict themselves and bring up later all sorts
of bosh on the subject of the culpable temerity of the operatives. </p>
<p>The state of the case is this: If children cannot take care, the employment
of children must be forbidden. If adults are reckless, they must be mere
overgrown children on a plane of intelligence which does not enable them to
appreciate the danger in its full scope; and who is to blame for this but the
bourgeoisie which keeps them in a condition in which their intelligence cannot
develop? Or the machinery is ill-arranged, and must be surrounded with fencing,
to supply which falls to the share of the bourgeoisie. Or the operative is
under inducements which outweigh the threatened danger; he must work rapidly to
earn his wages, has no time to take care, and for this, too, the bourgeoisie is
to blame. Many accidents happen, for instance, while the operatives are
cleaning machinery in motion. Why? Because the bourgeois would otherwise oblige
the worker to clean the machinery during the free hours while it is not going,
and the worker naturally is not disposed to sacrifice any part of his free
time. Every free hour is so precious to the worker that he often risks his life
twice a week rather than sacrifice one of them to the bourgeois. Let the
employer take from working-hours the time required for cleaning the machinery,
and it will never again occur to an operative to clean machinery in motion. In
short, from whatever point of view, the blame falls ultimately on the
manufacturer, and of him should be required, at the very least, life-long
support of the incapacitated operative, and support of the victim’s
family in case death follows the accident. In the earliest period of
manufacture, the accidents were much more numerous in proportion than now, for
the machinery was inferior, smaller, more crowded, and almost never fenced. But
the number is still large enough, as the foregoing cases prove, to arouse the
grave question as to a state of things which permits so many deformities and
mutilations for the benefit of a single class, and plunges so many industrious
working-people into want and starvation by reason of injuries undergone in the
service and through the fault of the bourgeoisie. </p>
<p>A pretty list of diseases engendered purely by the hateful money-greed of
the manufacturers! Women made unfit for child-bearing, children deformed, men
enfeebled, limbs crushed, whole generations wrecked, afflicted with disease and
infirmity, purely to fill the purses of the bourgeoisie. And when one reads of
the barbarism of single cases, how children are seized naked in bed by the
overlookers, and driven with blows and kicks to the factory, their clothing
over their arms, how their sleepiness is driven off with blows, how they fall
asleep over their work nevertheless, how one poor child sprang up, still
asleep, at the call of the overlooker, and mechanically went through the
operations of its work after its machine was stopped; when one reads how
children, too tired to go home, hide away in the wool in the drying-room to
sleep there, and could only be driven out of the factory with straps; how many
hundreds came home so tired every night, that they could eat no supper for
sleepiness and want of appetite, that their parents found them kneeling by the
bedside, where they had fallen asleep during their prayers; when one reads all
this and a hundred other villainies and infamies in this one report, all
testified to on oath, confirmed by several witnesses, deposed by men whom the
commissioners themselves declare trustworthy; when one reflects that this is a
Liberal report, a bourgeois report, made for the purpose of reversing the
previous Tory report, and rehabilitating the pureness of heart of the
manufacturers, that the commissioners themselves are on the side of the
bourgeoisie, and report all these things against their own will, how can one be
otherwise than filled with wrath and resentment against a class which boasts of
philanthropy and self-sacrifice, while its one object is to fill its purse
<i>a tout prix</i>? Meanwhile, let us listen to the bourgeoisie speaking
through the mouth of its chosen apostle, Dr. Ure, who relates in his
<i>Philosophy of Manufactures</i> that the workers have been told that their
wages bore no proportion to their sacrifices, the good understanding between
masters and men being thus disturbed. Instead of this, the working-men should
have striven to recommend themselves by attention and industry, and should have
rejoiced in the prosperity of their masters. They would then become overseers,
superintendents, and finally partners, and would thus – (Oh! Wisdom, thou
speakest as the dove!) – “have increased at the same time the
demand for their companions’ labour in the market!" </p>
<p class="indentb">"Had it not been for the violent collisions and
interruptions resulting from erroneous views among the operatives, the factory
system would have been developed still more rapidly and beneficially."</p>
<p class="fst">Hereupon follows a long Jeremiad upon the spirit of resistance
of the operatives, and on the occasion of a strike of the best-paid workers,
the fine spinners, the following naive observation: </p>
<p class="indentb">"In fact, it was their high wages which enabled them to
maintain a stipendiary committee in affluence, and to pamper themselves into
nervous ailments, by a diet too rich and exciting for their indoor
employments."</p>
<p class="fst">Let us hear how the bourgeois describes the work of children:
</p>
<p class="indentb">"I have visited many factories, both in Manchester and in
the surrounding districts, during a period of several months, entering the
spinning-rooms unexpectedly, and often alone, at different times of the day,
and I never saw a single instance of corporal chastisement inflicted on a
child; nor, indeed, did I ever see children in ill-humour. They seemed to be
always cheerful and alert; taking pleasure in the light play of their muscles,
enjoying the mobility natural to their age. The scene of industry, so far from
exciting sad emotions, in my mind, was always exhilarating. It was delightful
to observe the nimbleness with which they pieced broken ends, as the mule
carriage began to recede from the fixed roller beam, and to see them at
leisure, after a few seconds’ exercise of their tiny fingers, to amuse
themselves in any attitude they chose, till the stretch and winding on were
once more completed. The work of these lively elves seemed to resemble a sport,
in which habit gave them a pleasing dexterity. Conscious of their skill, they
were delighted to show it off to any stranger. As to exhaustion by the
day’s work, they evinced no trace of it on emerging from the mill in the
evening; for they immediately began to skip about any neighbouring play-ground,
and to commence their little games with the same alacrity as boys issuing from
a school."</p>
<p class="fst">Naturally! As though the immediate movement of every muscle were
not an urgent necessity for frames grown at once stiff and relaxed! But Ure
should have waited to see whether this momentary excitement had not subsided
after a couple of minutes. And besides, Ure could see this whole performance
only in the afternoon after five or six hours’ work, but not in the
evening! As to the health of the operatives, the bourgeois has the boundless
impudence to cite the report of 1833 just quoted in a thousand places, as
testimony for the excellent health of these people; to try to prove by detached
and garbled quotations that no trace of scrofula can be found among them, and,
what is quite true, that the factory system frees them from all acute diseases
(that they have every variety of chronic affection instead he naturally
conceals). To explain the impudence with which our friend Ure palms off the
grossest falsehoods upon the English public, it must be known that the report
consists of three large folio volumes, which it never occurs to a well-fed
English bourgeois to study through. Let us hear further how he expresses
himself as to the Factory Act of 1833, passed by the Liberal bourgeoisie, and
imposing only the most meagre limitations upon the manufacturers, as we shall
see. This law, especially its compulsory education clause, he calls an absurd
and despotic measure directed against the manufacturers, through which all
children under twelve years of age have been thrown out of employment; and with
what results? The children thus discharged from their light and useful
occupation receive no education whatsoever; cast out from the warm
spinning-room into a cold world, they subsist only by begging and stealing, a
life in sad contrast with their steadily improving condition in the factory and
in Sunday school. Under the mask of philanthropy, this law intensifies the
sufferings of the poor, and will greatly restrict the conscientious
manufacturer in his useful work, if, indeed, it does not wholly stop him. </p>
<p>The ruinous influence of the factory system began at an early day to attract
general attention. We have already alluded to the Apprentices’ Act of
1802. Later, towards 1817, Robert Owen, then a manufacturer in New Lanark, in
Scotland, afterwards founder of English Socialism, began to call the attention
of the Government, by memorials and petitions, to the necessity of legislative
guarantees for the health of the operatives, and especially of children. The
late Sir Robert Peel and other philanthropists united with him, and gradually
secured the Factory Acts of 1819, 1825, and 1831, of which the first two were
never enforced, and the last only here and there. This law of 1831, based upon
the motion of Sir J. C. Hobhouse, provided that in cotton mills no one under
twenty-one should be employed between half-past seven at night and half-past
five in the morning; and that in all factories young persons under eighteen
should work no longer than twelve hours daily, and nine hours on Saturday. But
since operatives could not testify against their masters without being
discharged, this law helped matters very little. In the great cities, where the
operatives were more restive, the larger manufacturers came to an agreement
among themselves to obey the law; but even there, there were many who, like the
employers in the country, did not trouble themselves about it. Meanwhile, the
demand for a ten hours’ law had become lively among the operatives; that
is, for a law which should forbid all operatives under eighteen years of age to
work longer than ten hours daily; the Trades Unions, by their agitation, made
this demand general throughout the manufacturing population; the philanthropic
section of the Tory party, then led by Michael Sadler, seized upon the plan,
and brought it before Parliament. Sadler obtained a parliamentary committee for
the investigation of the factory system, and this committee reported in 1832.
Its report was emphatically partisan, composed by strong enemies of the factory
system, for party ends. Sadler permitted himself to be betrayed by his noble
enthusiasm into the most distorted and erroneous statements, drew from his
witnesses by the very form of his questions, answers which contained the truth,
but truth in a perverted form. The manufacturers themselves, incensed at a
report which represented them as monsters, now demanded an official
investigation; they knew that an exact report must, in this case, be
advantageous to them; they knew that Whigs, genuine bourgeois, were at the
helm, with whom they were upon good terms, whose principles were opposed to any
restriction upon manufacture. They obtained a commission, in due order,
composed of Liberal bourgeois, whose report I have so often cited. This comes
somewhat nearer the truth than Sadler’s, but its deviations therefrom are
in the opposite direction. On every page it betrays sympathy with the
manufacturers, distrust of the Sadler report, repugnance to the working-men
agitating independently and the supporters of the Ten Hours’ Bill. It
nowhere recognises the right of the working-man to a life worthy of a human
being, to independent activity, and opinions of his own. It reproaches the
operatives that in sustaining the Ten Hours’ Bill they thought, not of
the children only, but of themselves as well; it calls the working-men engaged
in the agitation demagogues, ill-intentioned, malicious, etc., is written, in
short, on the side of the bourgeoisie; and still it cannot whitewash the
manufacturers, and still it leaves such a mass of infamies upon the shoulders
of the employers, that even after this report, the agitation for the Ten
Hours’ Bill, the hatred against the manufacturers, and the
committee’s severest epithets applied to them are all fully justified.
But there was the one difference, that whereas the Sadler report accuses the
manufacturers of open, undisguised brutality, it now became evident that this
brutality was chiefly carried on under the mask of civilisation and humanity.
Yet Dr. Hawkins, the medical commissioner for Lancashire, expresses himself
decidedly in favour of the Ten Hours’ Bill in the opening lines of his
report, and Commissioner Mackintosh explains that his own report does not
contain the whole truth, because it is very difficult to induce the operatives
to testify against their employers, and because the manufacturers, besides
being forced into greater concessions towards their operatives by the
excitement among the latter, are often prepared for the inspection of the
factories, have them swept, the speed of the machinery reduced, etc. In
Lancashire especially they resorted to the device of bringing the overlookers
of work-rooms before the commissioners, and letting them testify as working-men
to the humanity of the employers, the wholesome effects of the work, and the
indifference, if not the hostility of the operatives, towards the Ten
Hours’ Bill. But these are not genuine working-men; they are deserters
from their class, who have entered the service of the bourgeoisie for better
pay, and fight in the interests of the capitalists against the workers. Their
interest is that of the capitalists, and they are, therefore, almost more hated
by the workers than the manufacturers themselves. </p>
<p>And yet this report suffices wholly to exhibit the most shameful
recklessness of the manufacturing bourgeoisie towards its employees, the whole
infamy of the industrial exploiting system in its full inhumanity. Nothing is
more revolting than to compare the long register of diseases and deformities
engendered by overwork, in this report, with the cold, calculating political
economy of the manufacturers, by which they try to prove that they, and with
them all England, must go to ruin, if they should be forbidden to cripple so
and so many children every year. The language of Dr. Ure alone, which I have
quoted, would be yet more revolting if it were not so preposterous. </p>
<p>The result of this report was the Factory Act of 1833, which forbade the
employment of children under nine years of age (except in silk mills), limited
the working-hours of children between 9-13 years to 48 per week, or 9 hours in
any one day at the utmost; that of young persons from 14-18 years of age to 69
per week, or 12 on any one day as the maximum, provided for an hour and a half
as the minimum interval for meals, and repeated the total prohibition of
night-work for persons under eighteen years of age. Compulsory school
attendance two hours daily was prescribed for all children under fourteen
years, and the manufacturer declared punishable in case of employing children
without a certificate of age from the factory surgeon, and a certificate of
school attendance from the teacher. As recompense, the employer was permitted
to withdraw one penny from the child’s weekly earnings to pay the
teacher. Further, surgeons and inspectors were appointed to visit the factories
at all times, take testimony of operatives on oath, and enforce the law by
prosecution before a Justice of the Peace. This is the law against which Dr.
Ure inveighs in such unmeasured terms! </p>
<p>The consequence of this law, and especially of the appointment of
inspectors, was the reduction of working-hours to an average of twelve to
thirteen, and the superseding of children as far as possible. Hereupon some of
the most crying evils disappeared almost wholly. Deformities arose now only in
cases of weak constitution, and the effects of overwork became much less
conspicuous. Nevertheless, enough testimony remains to be found in the Factory
Report, that the lesser evils, swelling of the ankles, weakness and pain in the
legs, hips, and back, varicose veins, ulcers on the lower extremities, general
weakness, especially of the pelvic region, nausea, want of appetite alternating
with unnatural hunger, indigestion, hypochondria, affections of the chest in
consequence of the dust and foul atmosphere of the factories, etc., etc., all
occur among employees subject to the provisions of Sir J. C. Hobhouse’s
Law (of 1831), which prescribes twelve to thirteen hours as the maximum. The
reports from Glasgow and Manchester are especially worthy of attention in this
respect. These evils remained too, after the law of 1833, and continue to
undermine the health of the working-class to this day. Care has been taken to
give the brutal profit-greed of the bourgeoisie a hypocritical, civilised form,
to restrain the manufacturers through the arm of the law from too conspicuous
villainies, and thus to give them a pretext for self-complacently parading
their sham philanthropy. That is all. If a new commission were appointed today,
it would find things pretty much as before. As to the extemporised compulsory
attendance at school, it remained wholly a dead letter, since the Government
failed to provide good schools. The manufacturers employed as teachers worn-out
operatives, to whom they sent the children two hours daily, thus complying with
the letter of the law; but the children learned nothing. And even the reports
of the factory inspectors, which are limited to the scope of the
inspector’s duties, i.e., the enforcement of the Factory Act, give data
enough to justify the conclusion that the old evils inevitably remain.
Inspectors Horner and Saunders, in their reports for October and December,
1843, state that, in a number of branches in which the employment of children
can be dispensed with or superseded by that of adults, the working-day is still
fourteen to sixteen hours, or even longer. Among the operatives in these
branches they found numbers of young people who had just outgrown the
provisions of the law. Many employers disregard the law, shorten the meal
times, work children longer than is permitted, and risk prosecution, knowing
that the possible fines are trifling in comparison with the certain profits
derivable from the offence. Just at present especially, while business is
exceptionally brisk, they are under great temptation in this respect. </p>
<p>Meanwhile the agitation for the Ten Hours’ Bill by no means died out
among the operatives; in 1839 it was under full headway once more, and
Sadler’s place, he having died, was filled in the House of Commons by
Lord Ashley and Richard Oastler, both Tories. Oastler especially, who carried
on a constant agitation in the factory districts, and had been active in the
same way during Sadler’s life, was the particular favourite of the
working-men. They called him their “good old king", “the king of
the factory children", and there is not a child in the factory districts that
does not know and revere him, that does not join the procession which moves to
welcome him when he enters a town. Oastler vigorously opposed the New Poor Law
also, and was therefore imprisoned for debt by a Mr. Thornhill, on whose estate
he was employed as agent, and to whom he owed money. The Whigs offered
repeatedly to pay his debt and confer other favours upon him if he would only
give up his agitation against the Poor Law. But in vain; he remained in prison,
whence he published his Fleet Papers against the factory system and the Poor
Law. </p>
<p>The Tory Government of 1841 turned its attention once more to the Factory
Acts. The Home Secretary, Sir James Graham, proposed, in 1845, a bill
restricting the working-hours of children to six and one-half, and making the
enactments for compulsory school attendance more effective, the principal point
in this connection being a provision for better schools. This bill was,
however, wrecked by the jealousy of the dissenters; for, although compulsory
religious instruction was not extended to the children of dissenters, the
schools provided for were to be placed under the general supervision of the
Established Church, and the Bible made the general reading-book, religion being
thus made the foundation of all instruction, whence the dissenters felt
themselves threatened. The manufacturers and the Liberals generally united with
them, the working-men were divided by the Church question, and therefore
inactive. The opponents of the bill, though outweighed in the great
manufacturing towns, such as Salford and Stockport, and able in others, such as
Manchester, to attack certain of its points only, for fear of the working-men,
collected nevertheless nearly two million signatures for a petition against it,
and Graham allowed himself to be so far intimidated as to withdraw the whole
bill. The next year he omitted the school clauses, and proposed that, instead
of the previous provisions, children between eight and thirteen years should be
restricted to six and one-half hours, and so employed as to have either the
whole morning or the whole afternoon free; that young people between thirteen
and eighteen years, and all females, should be limited to twelve hours; and
that the hitherto frequent evasions of the law should be prevented. Hardly had
he proposed this bill, when the ten hours’ agitation was begun again more
vigorously than ever. Oastler had just then regained his liberty; a number of
his friends and a collection among the workers had paid his debt, and he threw
himself into the movement with all his might. The defenders of the Ten
Hours’ Bill in the House of Commons had increased in numbers, the masses
of petitions supporting it which poured in from all sides brought them allies,
and on March 19th, 1844, Lord Ashley carried, with a majority of 179 to 170, a
resolution that the word “Night” in the Factory Act should express
the time from six at night to six in the morning, whereby the prohibition of
night-work came to mean the limitation of working-hours to twelve, including
free hours, or ten hours of actual work a day. But the Ministry did not agree
to this. Sir James Graham began to threaten resignation from the Cabinet, and
at the next vote on the bill the House rejected by a small majority both ten
and twelve hours. Graham and Peel now announced that they should introduce a
new bill, and that if this failed to pass they should resign. The new bill was
exactly the old Twelve Hours’ Bill with some changes of form, and the
same House of Commons which had rejected the principal points of this bill in
March, now swallowed it whole. The reason of this was that most of the
supporters of the Ten Hours’ Bill were Tories who let fall the bill
rather than the Ministry; but be the motives what they may, the House of
Commons by its votes upon this subject, each vote reversing the last, has
brought itself into the greatest contempt among all the workers, and proved
most brilliantly the Chartists’ assertion of the necessity of its reform.
Three members, who had formerly voted against the Ministry, afterwards voted
for it and rescued it. In all the divisions, the bulk of the opposition voted
<i>for</i> and the bulk of its own party <i>against</i> the Ministry. The
foregoing propositions of Graham touching the employment of children six and
one-half and of all other operatives twelve hours’ are now legislative
provisions, and by them and by the limitation of overwork for making up time
lost through breakdown of machinery or insufficient water-power by reason of
frost or drought, a working-day of more than twelve hours has been made
well-nigh impossible. There remains, however, no doubt that, in a very short
time, the Ten Hours’ Bill will really be adopted. The manufacturers are
naturally all against it; there are perhaps not ten who are for it; they have
used every honourable and dishonourable means against this dreaded measure, but
with no other result than that of drawing down upon them the ever-deepening
hatred of the working-men. The bill will pass. What the working-men will do
they can do, and that they will have this bill they proved last spring. The
economic arguments of the manufacturers that a Ten Hours’ Bill would
increase the cost of production and incapacitate the English producers for
competition in foreign markets, and that wages must fall, are all <i>half</i>
true; but they prove nothing except this, that the industrial greatness of
England can be maintained only through the barbarous treatment of the
operatives, the destruction of their health, the social, physical, and mental
decay of whole generations. Naturally, if the Ten Hours’ Bill were a
final measure, it must ruin England; but since it must inevitably bring with it
other measures which must draw England into a path wholly different from that
hitherto followed, it can only prove an advance. </p>
<p>Let us turn to another side of the factory system which cannot be remedied
by legislative provisions so easily as the diseases now engendered by it. We
have already alluded in a general way to the nature of the employment, and
enough in detail to be able to draw certain inferences from the facts given.
The supervision of machinery, the joining of broken threads, is no activity
which claims the operative’s thinking powers, yet it is of a sort which
prevents him from occupying his mind with other things. We have seen, too, that
this work affords the muscles no opportunity for physical activity. Thus it is,
properly speaking, not work, but tedium, the most deadening, wearing process
conceivable. The operative is condemned to let his physical and mental powers
decay in this utter monotony, it is his mission to be bored every day and all
day long from his eighth year. Moreover, he must not take a moment’s
rest; the engine moves unceasingly; the wheels, the straps, the spindles hum
and rattle in his ears without a pause, and if he tries to snatch one instant,
there is the overlooker at his back with the book of fines. This condemnation
to be buried alive in the mill, to give constant attention to the tireless
machine is felt as the keenest torture by the operatives, and its action upon
mind and body is in the long run stunting in the highest degree. There is no
better means of inducing stupefaction than a period of factory-work, and if the
operatives have, nevertheless, not only rescued their intelligence, but
cultivated and sharpened it more than other working-men, they have found this
possible only in rebellion against their fate and against the bourgeoisie, the
sole subject on which under all circumstances they can think and feel while at
work. Or, if this indignation against the bourgeoisie does not become the
supreme passion of the working-man, the inevitable consequence is drunkenness
and all that is generally called demoralisation. The physical enervation and
the sickness, universal in consequence of the factory system, were enough to
induce Commissioner Hawkins to attribute this demoralisation thereto as
inevitable; how much more when mental lassitude is added to them, and when the
influences already mentioned which tempt every working-man to demoralisation,
make themselves felt here too! There is no cause for surprise, therefore, that
in the manufacturing towns especially, drunkenness and sexual excesses have
reached the pitch which I have already described. <a href="#12" id="[12]"><sup class="enote">[12]</sup></a> </p>
<p>Further, the slavery in which the bourgeoisie holds the proletariat chained,
is nowhere more conspicuous than in the factory system. Here ends all freedom
in law and in fact. The operative must be in the mill at half-past five in the
morning; if he comes a couple of minutes too late, he is fined; if he comes ten
minutes too late, he is not let in until breakfast is over, and a quarter of
the day’s wages is withheld, though he loses only two and one-half
hours’ work out of twelve. He must eat, drink, and sleep at command. For
satisfying the most imperative needs, he is vouchsafed the least possible time
absolutely required by them. Whether his dwelling is a half-hour or a whole one
removed from the factory does not concern his employer. The despotic bell calls
him from his bed, his breakfast, his dinner. </p>
<p>What a time he has of it, too, inside the factory! Here the employer is
absolute law-giver; he makes regulations at will, changes and adds to his codex
at pleasure, and even, if he inserts the craziest stuff, the courts say to the
working-man: </p>
<p class="indentb">"You were your own master, no one forced you to agree to
such a contract if you did not wish to; but now, when you have freely entered
into it, you must be bound by it." </p>
<p class="fst">And so the working-man only gets into the bargain the mockery of
the Justice of the Peace who is a bourgeois himself, and of the law which is
made by the bourgeoisie. Such decisions have been given often enough. In
October, 1844, the operatives of Kennedy’s mill, in Manchester, struck.
Kennedy prosecuted them on the strength of a regulation placarded in the mill,
that at no time more than two operatives in one room may quit work at once. And
the court decided in his favour, giving the working-men the explanation cited
above. And such rules as these usually are! For instance: 1. The doors are
closed ten minutes after work begins, and thereafter no one is admitted until
the breakfast hour; whoever is absent during this time forfeits 3d. per loom.
2. Every power-loom weaver detected absenting himself at another time, while
the machinery is in motion, forfeits for each hour and each loom, 3d. Every
person who leaves the room during working- hours, without obtaining permission
from the overlooker, forfeits 3d. 3. Weavers who fail to supply themselves with
scissors forfeit, per day, 1d. 4. All broken shuttles, brushes, oil-cans,
wheels, window-panes, etc., must be paid for by the weaver. 5. No weaver to
stop work without giving a week’s notice. The manufacturer may dismiss
any employee without notice for bad work or improper behaviour. 6. Every
operative detected speaking to another, singing or whistling, will be fined
6d.; for leaving his place during working-hours, 6d. Another copy of factory
regulations lies before me, according to which every operative who comes three
minutes too late, forfeits the wages for a quarter of an hour, and every one
who comes twenty minutes too late, for a quarter of a day. Every one who
remains absent until breakfast forfeits a shilling on Monday, and sixpence
every other day of the week, etc., etc. This last is the regulation of the
Phoenix Works in Jersey Street, Manchester. It may be said that such rules are
necessary in a great, complicated factory, in order to insure the harmonious
working of the different parts; it may be asserted that such a severe
discipline is as necessary here as in an army. This may be so, but what sort of
a social order is it which cannot be maintained without such shameful tyranny?
Either the end sanctifies the means, or the inference of the badness of the end
from the badness of the means is justified. Every one who has served as a
soldier knows what it is to be subjected even for a short time to military
discipline. But these operatives are condemned from their ninth year to their
death to live under the sword, physically and mentally. They are worse slaves
than the Negroes in America, for they are more sharply watched, and yet it is
demanded of them that they shall live like human beings, shall think and feel
like men! Verily, this they can do only under glowing hatred towards their
oppressors, and towards that order of things which places them in such a
position, which degrades them to machines. But it is far more shameful yet,
that according to the universal testimony of the operatives, numbers of
manufacturers collect the fines imposed upon the operatives with the most
heartless severity, and for the purpose of piling up extra profits out of the
farthings thus extorted from the impoverished proletarians. Leach asserts, too,
that the operatives often find the factory clock moved forward a quarter of an
hour and the doors shut, while the clerk moves about with the fines-book
inside, noting the many names of the absentees. Leach claims to have counted
ninety-five operatives thus shut out, standing before a factory, whose clock
was a quarter of an hour slower than the town clocks at night, and a quarter of
an hour faster in the morning. The Factory Report relates similar facts. In one
factory the clock was set back during working-hours, so that the operatives
worked overtime without extra pay; in another, a whole quarter of an hour
overtime was worked; in a third, there were two clocks, an ordinary one and a
machine clock, which registered the revolutions of the main shaft; if the
machinery went slowly, working-hours were measured by the machine clock until
the number of revolutions due in twelve hours was reached; if work went well,
so that the number was reached before the usual working-hours were ended, the
operatives were forced to toil on to the end of the twelfth hour. The witness
adds that he had known girls who had good work, and who had worked overtime,
who, nevertheless, betook themselves to a life of prostitution rather than
submit to this tyranny. To return to the fines, Leach relates having repeatedly
seen women in the last period of pregnancy fined 6d. for the offence of sitting
down a moment to rest. Fines for bad work are wholly arbitrary; the goods are
examined in the wareroom, and the supervisor charges the fines upon a list
without even summoning the operative, who only learns that he has been fined
when the overlooker pays his wages, and the goods have perhaps been sold, or
certainly been placed beyond his reach. Leach has in his possession such a
fines list, ten feet long, and amounting to £35 17s. 10d. He relates that in
the factory where this list was made, a new supervisor was dismissed for fining
too little, and so bringing in five pounds too little weekly. And I repeat that
I know Leach to be a thoroughly trustworthy man incapable of a falsehood. </p>
<p>But the operative is his employer’s slave in still other respects. If
his wife or daughter finds favour in the eyes of the master, a command, a hint
suffices, and she must place herself at his disposal. When the employer wishes
to supply with signatures a petition in favour of bourgeois interests, he need
only send it to his mill. If he wishes to decide a Parliamentary election, he
sends his enfranchised operatives in rank and file to the polls, and they vote
for the bourgeois candidate whether they will or no. If he desires a majority
in a public meeting, he dismisses them half-an- hour earlier than usual, and
secures them places close to the platform, where he can watch them to his
satisfaction. </p>
<p>Two further arrangements contribute especially to force the operative under
the dominion of the manufacturer; the Truck system and the Cottage system. The
truck system, the payment of the operatives in goods, was formerly universal in
England. The manufacturer opens a shop, “for the convenience of the
operatives, and to protect them from the high prices of the petty dealers".
Here goods of all sorts are sold to them on credit, and to keep the operatives
from going to the shops where they could get their goods more cheaply –
the “Tommy shops” usually charging twenty-five to thirty per cent
more than others – wages are paid in requisitions on the shop instead of
money. The general indignation against this infamous system led to the passage
of the Truck Act in 1831, by which, for most employees, payment in truck orders
was declared void and illegal, and was made punishable by fine; but, like most
other English laws, this has been enforced only here and there. In the towns it
is carried out comparatively efficiently; but in the country, the truck system,
disguised or undisguised, flourishes. In the town of Leicester, too, it is very
common. There lie before me nearly a dozen convictions for this offence, dating
from the period between November, 1843, and June, 1844, and reported, in part,
in the <i>Manchester Guardian </i>and, in part, in the <i>Northern
Star</i>. The system is, of course, less openly carried on at present; wages
are usually paid in cash, but the employer still has means enough at command to
force him to purchase his wares in the truck shop and nowhere else. Hence it is
difficult to combat the truck system, because it can now be carried on under
cover of the law, provided only that the operative receives his wages in money.
<i>The Northern Star</i> of April 27th, 1844, publishes a letter from an
operative of Holmfirth, near Huddersfield, in Yorkshire, which refers to a
manufacturer of the name of Bowers, as follows: </p>
<p class="indentb">"It is almost strainge to see that the accursed truck sistim
should exist to the enormoust extent that it dose in Holmfirth, and no one to
be found to have the moral courage to attempt to put a stop to it. Thaire are a
greate many honest handloome weavers that is suffering by that accursed sistim.
This is one specimen. Out of the many of that precious freetraid crew, thaire
is one manufacturer that as the curse of the whole neighbourhood upon im, for
is baseness towards is weavers. When they finnish a warp, which comes to £1
14s, or £1 16s, he gives them £l, and the rest in goods, wearing apparel, at 40
or 50 per sent dearer then at the regular shopkeeppers, and many a time the
goods are rotton. But as the Free-Trade Mercury says by the factory labour,
’they are not bound to take it; its quite optional’. O, yes; but
thay must eather take it or starve. If thay whant any more than the £1 0s 0d,
thay must wait of a warp a week or a fortnight; but if thay take the £1, 0s 0d
and the goods, thaire is always a warp for them. This is free traidism. Lord
Brougham says ‘we should lay something by in our young days, that we may
be independent in our old age of parochial relief.’ Must we lay by these
rotton goods? If this did not come from a lord, thay would think is brains wear
as rotton as the goods wee got for our labour. When the unstampt newspapers
wear in circulation thaire wear no lack of informers in Holmfirth. Thaire wear
the Blyths, the Estwoods, &amp;, but wear are they now? O, but this is quite
different. Our truckster is one of the free trading pious crew. He goes to the
church twise every Sunday, and repeats after the parson very fervently:
‘we have left undone those things wich we hought to have done; we have
done those things wich we hought not to have done; and thaire is no help in us;
but spare us, good Lord.’ -Yes, spare us wile morning, and we will pay
our weavers wages in rotton goods again.” </p>
<p class="fst">The Cottage system looks much more innocent and arose in a much
more harmless way, though it has the same enslaving influence upon the
employee. In the neighbourhood of the mills in the country, there is often a
lack of dwelling accommodation for the operatives. The manufacturer is
frequently obliged to build such dwellings and does so gladly, as they yield
great advantages, besides the interest upon the capital invested. If any owner
of working-men’s dwellings averages about six per cent on his invested
capital, it is safe to calculate that the manufacturer’s cottages yield
twice this rate; for so long as his factory does not stand perfectly idle he is
sure of occupants, and of occupants who pay punctually. He is therefore spared
the two chief disadvantages under which other house-owners labour; his cottages
never stand empty, and he runs no risk. But the rent of the cottages is as high
as though these disadvantages were in full force, and by obtaining the same
rent as the ordinary house-owner, the manufacturer, at cost of the operatives,
makes a brilliant investment at twelve to fourteen per cent. For it is clearly
unjust that he should make twice as much profit as other competing
house-owners, who at the same time are excluded from competing with him. But it
implies a double wrong, when he draws his fixed profit from the pockets of the
non-possessing class, which must consider the expenditure of every penny. He is
used to that, however, he whose whole wealth is gained at the cost of his
employees. But this injustice becomes an infamy when the manufacturer, as often
happens, forces his operatives, who must occupy his houses on pain of
dismissal, to pay a higher rent than the ordinary one, or even to pay rent for
houses in which they do not live! <i>The Halifax Guardian,</i> quoted by the
Liberal <i>Sun,</i> asserts that hundreds of operatives in Ashton-
under-Lyne, Oldham, and Rochdale, etc., are forced by their employers to pay
house-rent whether they occupy the house or not. The cottage system is
universal in the country districts; it has created whole villages, and the
manufacturer usually has little or no competition against his houses, so that
he can fix his price regardless of any market rate, indeed at his pleasure. And
what power does the cottage system give the employer over his operatives in
disagreements between master and men? If the latter strike, he need only give
them notice to quit his premises, and the notice need only be a week; after
that time the operative is not only without bread but without a shelter, a
vagabond at the mercy of the law which sends him, without fail, to the
treadmill. </p>
<p>Such is the factory system sketched as fully as my space permits, and with
as little partisan spirit as the heroic deeds of the bourgeoisie against the
defenceless workers permit – deeds towards which it is impossible to
remain indifferent, towards which indifference were a crime. Let us compare the
condition of the free Englishman of 1845 with the Saxon serf under the lash of
the Norman barons of 1145. The serf was <i>glebae adscriptus</i>, bound to
the soil, so is the free working-man through the cottage system. The serf owed
his master the <i>jus primae noctis,</i> the right of the first night –
the free working-man must, on demand, surrender to his master not only that,
but the right of <i>every</i> night. The serf could acquire no property;
everything that he gained, his master could take from him; the free working-man
has no property, can gain none by reason of the pressure of competition, and
what even the Norman baron did not do, the modern manufacturer does. Through
the truck system, he assumes every day the administration in detail of the
things which the worker requires for his immediate necessities. The relation of
the lord of the soil to the serf was regulated by the prevailing customs and by
laws which were obeyed, because they corresponded to them. The free
working-man’s relation to his master is regulated by laws which are not
obeyed, because they correspond neither with the interests of the employer nor
with the prevailing customs. The lord of the soil could not separate the serf
from the land, nor sell him apart from it, and since almost all the land was
fief and there was no capital, practically could not sell him at all. The
modern bourgeois forces the working-man to sell himself. The serf was the slave
of the piece of land on which he was born, the working-man is the slave of his
own necessaries of life and of the money with which he has to buy them –
both are <i>slaves of a thing</i>. The serf had a guarantee for the means of
subsistence in the feudal order of society in which every member had his own
place<a id="art">.</a> The free working-man has no guarantee whatsoever,
because he has a place in society only when the bourgeoisie can make use of
him; in all other cases he is ignored, treated as non-existent. The serf
sacrificed himself for his master in war, the factory operative in peace. The
lord of the serf was a barbarian who regarded his villain as a head of cattle;
the employer of operatives is civilised and regards his “hand” as a
machine. In short, the position of the two is not far from equal, and if either
is at a disadvantage, it is the free working-man. Slaves they both are, with
the single difference that the slavery of the one is undissembled, open,
honest; that of the other cunning, sly, disguised, deceitfully concealed from
himself and every one else, a hypocritical servitude worse than the old. The
philanthropic Tories were right when they gave the operatives the name white
slaves. But the hypocritical disguised slavery recognises the right to freedom,
at least in outward form; bows before a freedom-loving public opinion, and
herein lies the historic progress as compared with the old servitude, that the
<i>principle</i> of freedom is affirmed, and the oppressed will one day see
to it that this principle is carried out. </p>
<p>At the close a few stanzas of a poem which voices the sentiments of the
workers themselves about the factory system. Written by Edward P. Mead of
Birmingham, it is a correct expression of the views prevailing among them.</p>
<p class="indentb">There is a King, and a ruthless King; Not a King of the
poet’s dream; But a tyrant fell, white slaves know well, And that
ruthless King is Steam.</p>
<p class="indentb">He hath an arm, an iron arm, And tho’ he hath but one,
In that mighty arm there is a charm, That millions hath undone.</p>
<p class="indentb">Like the ancient Moloch grim, his sire In Himmon’s
vale that stood, His bowels are of living fire, And children are his food.</p>
<p class="indentb">His priesthood are a hungry band, Blood-thirsty, proud, and
bold; ’Tis they direct his giant hand, In turning blood to gold.</p>
<p class="indentb">For filthy gain in their servile chain All nature’s
rights they bind; They mock at lovely woman’s pain, And to manly tears
are blind.</p>
<p class="indentb">The sighs and groans of Labour’s sons Are music in
their ear, And the skeleton shades, of lads and maids, In the Steam
King’s hell appear.</p>
<p class="indentb">Those hells upon earth, since the Steam King’s birth,
Have scatter’d around despair; For the human mind for Heav’n
design’d, With the body, is murdered there.</p>
<p class="indentb">Then down with the King, the Moloch King, Ye working
millions all; O chain his hand, or our native land Is destin’d by him to
fall.</p>
<p class="indentb">And his Satraps abhor’d, each proud Mill Lord, Now
gorg’d with gold and blood, Must be put down by the nation’s frown,
As well as their monster God. </p>
<p class="fst">I have neither time nor room to deal in detail with the replies
of the manufacturers to the charges made against them for twelve years past.
These men will not learn because their supposed interest blinds them. As,
moreover, many of their objections have been met in the foregoing, the
following is all that it is necessary for me to add: </p>
<p>You come to Manchester, you wish to make yourself acquainted with the state
of affairs in England. You naturally have good introductions to respectable
people. You drop a remark or two as to the condition of the workers. You are
made acquainted with a couple of the first Liberal manufacturers, Robert Hyde
Greg, perhaps, Edmund Ashworth, Thomas Ashton, or others. They are told of your
wishes. The manufacturer understands you, knows what he has to do. He
accompanies you to his factory in the country; Mr. Greg to Quarrybank in
Cheshire, Mr. Ashworth to Turton near Bolton, Mr. Ashton to Hyde. He leads you
through a superb, admirably arranged building, perhaps supplied with
ventilators, he calls your attention to the lofty, airy rooms, the fine
machinery, here and there a healthy-looking operative. He gives you an
excellent lunch, and proposes to you to visit the operatives’ homes; he
conducts you to the cottages, which look new, clean and neat, and goes with you
into this one and that one, naturally only to overlookers, mechanics, etc., so
that you may see -“families who live wholly from the factory”.
Among other families you might find that only wife and children work, and the
husband darns stockings. The presence of the employer keeps you from asking
indiscreet questions; you find every one well-paid, comfortable, comparatively
healthy by reason of the country air; you begin to be converted from your
exaggerated ideas of misery and starvation. But, that the cottage system makes
slaves of the operatives, that there may be a truck shop in the neighbourhood,
that the people hate the manufacturer, this they do not point out to you,
because he is present. He has built a school, church, reading-room, etc. That
he uses the school to train children to subordination, that he tolerates in the
reading-room such prints only as represent the interests of the bourgeoisie,
that he dismisses his employees if they read Chartist or Socialist papers or
books, this is all concealed from you. You see an easy, patriarchal relation,
you see the life of the overlookers, you see what the bourgeoisie promises the
workers if they become its slaves, mentally and morally. This “country
manufacture” has always been what the employers like to show, because in
it the disadvantages of the factory system, especially from the point of view
of health, are, in part, done away with by the free air and surroundings, and
because the patriarchal servitude of the workers can here be longest
maintained. Dr. Ure sings a dithyramb upon the theme. But woe to the operatives
to whom it occurs to think for themselves and become Chartists! For them the
paternal affection of the manufacturer comes to a sudden end. Further, if you
should wish to be accompanied through the working-people’s quarters of
Manchester, if you should desire to see the development of the factory system
in a factory town, you may wait long before these rich bourgeoisie will help
you! These gentlemen do not know in what condition their employees are nor what
they want, and they dare not know things which would make them uneasy or even
oblige them to act in opposition to their own interests. But, fortunately, that
is of no consequence: what the working-men have to carry out, they carry out
for themselves.<br>

<p><a href="#[12]" id="12">12</a>. Let us hear another competent judge:
“When this example [i.e., of the Irish] is considered in connexion with
the unremitted labour of the whole population engaged in the various branches
of the cotton manufacture, our wonder will be less excited by their fatal
demoralisation. Prolonged and exhausting labour, continued from day to day, and
from year to year, is not calculated to develop the intellectual or moral
faculties of man. The dull routine of a ceaseless drudgery, in which the same
mechanical process is incessantly repeated, resembles the torment of Sisyphus
– the toil, like the rock, recoils perpetually on the wearied operative.
The mind gathers neither stores nor strength from the constant extension and
retraction of the same muscles. The intellect slumbers in supine inertness; but
the grosser parts of our nature attain a rank development. To condemn man to
such severity of toil is, in some measure, to cultivate in him the habits of an
animal. He becomes reckless. He disregards the distinguishing appetites and
habits of his species. He neglects the comforts and delicacies of life. He
lives in squalid wretchedness, on meagre food, and expounds his superfluous
gains in debauchery.” – Dr. J. Kay.– <i>Note by Engels.</i>

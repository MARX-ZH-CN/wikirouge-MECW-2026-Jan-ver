<p class="title">Condition of the Working Class in England, by Engels, 1845</p>
<h1>The Mining Proletariat</h1>
<p>The production of raw materials and fuel for a manufacture so colossal as
that of England requires a considerable number of workers. But of all the
materials needed for its industries (except wool, which belongs to the
agricultural districts), England produces only the minerals: the metals and the
coal. While Cornwall possesses rich copper, tin, zinc, and lead mines,
Staffordshire, Wales, and other districts yield great quantities of iron, and
almost the whole North and West of England, central Scotland, and certain
districts of Ireland, produce a superabundance of coal.<a href="#anchor88752" id="anchor96210"><sup class="enote">[1]</sup></a>
<p>In the Cornish mines about 19,000 men, and 11,000 women and children are
employed, in part above and in part below ground. Within the mines below
ground, men and boys above twelve years old are employed almost exclusively.
The condition of these workers seems, according to the Children's Employment
Commission's Report, to be comparatively endurable, materially, and the English
often enough boast of their strong, bold miners, who follow the veins of
mineral below the bottom of the very sea. But in the matter of the health of
these workers, this same Children's Employment Commission's Report judges
differently. It shows in Dr. Barham's intelligent report how the inhalation of
an atmosphere containing little oxygen, and mixed with dust amid the smoke of
blasting powder, such as prevails in the mines, seriously affects the lungs,
disturbs the action of the heart, and diminishes the activity of the digestive
organs; that wearing toil, and especially the climbing up and down of ladders,
upon which even vigorous young men have to spend in some mines more than an
hour a day, and which precedes and follows daily work, contributes greatly to
the development of these evils, so that men who begin this work in early youth
are far from reaching the stature of women who work above ground; that many die
young of galloping consumption, and most miners at middle age of slow
consumption; that they age prematurely and become unfit for work between the
thirty-fifth and forty-fifth years; that many are attacked by acute
inflammations of the respiratory organs when exposed to the sudden change from
the warm air of the shaft (after climbing the ladder in profuse perspiration)
to the cold wind above ground; and that these acute inflammations are very
frequently fatal. Work above ground, breaking and sorting the ore, is done by
girls and children, and is described as very wholesome, being done in the open
air.</p>
<p>In the North of England, on the borders of Northumberland and Durham, are
the extensive lead-mines of Alston Moor. The reports from this districts agree
almost wholly with those from Cornwall. Here, too, there are complaints of want
of oxygen, excessive dust, powder smoke, carbonic acid gas, and sulphur, in the
atmosphere of the workings. In consequence, the miners here, as in Cornwall,
are small of stature, and nearly all suffer from the thirtieth year throughout
life from chest affections, which end, especially when this work is persisted
in, as is almost always the case, in consumption, so greatly shortening the
average of life of these people. If the miners of this district are somewhat
longer lived than those of Cornwall, this is the case, because they do not
enter the mines before reaching the nineteenth year, while in Cornwall, as we
have seen, this work is begun in the twelfth year. Nevertheless, the majority
die here, too, between forty and fifty years of age, according to medical
testimony. Of 79 miners, whose death was entered upon the public register of
the district, and who attained an average of 45 years, 37 had died of
consumption and 6 of asthma. In the surrounding districts, Allendale, Stanhope,
and Middleton, the average length of life was 49, 48, and 47 years
respectively, and the deaths from chest affections composed 48, 54, and 56 per
cent of the whole number. Let us compare these figures with the so-called
Swedish tables, detailed tables of mortality embracing all the inhabitants of
Sweden, and recognised in England as the most correct standard hitherto
attainable for the average length of life of the British working-class.
According to them, male persons who survive the nineteenth year attain an
average of 57 1/2 years; but, according to this, the North of England miners
are robbed by their work of an average of ten years of life. Yet the Swedish
tables are accepted as the standard of longevity of the <i>workers</i>, and
present, therefore, the average chances of life as affected by the unfavourable
conditions in which the proletariat lives, a standard of longevity less than
the normal one. In this district we find again the lodging-houses and sleeping-
places with which we have already become acquainted in the towns, and in quite
as filthy, disgusting, and overcrowded a state as there. Commissioner Mitchell
visited one such sleeping barrack, 18 feet long, 15 feet wide, and arranged for
the reception of 42 men and 14 boys, or 56 persons altogether, one-half of whom
slept above the other in berths as on shipboard. There was no opening for the
escape of the foul air; and, although no one had slept in this pen for three
nights preceding the visit, the smell and the atmosphere were such that
Commissioner Mitchell could not endure it a moment. What must it be through a
hot summer night, with fifty-six occupants? And this is not the steerage of an
American slave ship, it is the dwelling of free-born Britons!</p>
<p>Let us turn now to the most important branch of British mining, the iron and
coal-mines, which the Children's Employment Commission treats in common, and
with all the detail which the importance of the subject demands. Nearly the
whole of the first part of this report is devoted to the condition of the
workers employed in these mines. After the detailed description which I have
furnished of the state of the industrial workers, I shall, however, be able to
be as brief in dealing with this subject as the scope of the present work
requires.</p>
<p>In the coal and iron mines which are worked in pretty much the same way,
children of four, five, and seven years are employed. They are set to
transporting the ore or coal loosened by the miner from its place to the
horse-path or the main shaft, and to opening and shutting the doors (which
separate the divisions of the mine and regulate its ventilation) for the
passage of workers and material. For watching the doors the smallest children
are usually employed, who thus pass twelve hours daily, in the dark, alone,
sitting usually in damp passages without even having work enough to save them
from the stupefying, brutalising tedium of doing nothing. The transport of coal
and iron-stone, on the other hand, is very hard labour, the stuff being shoved
in large tubs, without wheels, over the uneven floor of the mine; often over
moist clay, or through water, and frequently up steep inclines and through
paths so low-roofed that the workers are forced to creep on hands and knees.
For this more wearing labour, therefore, older children and half-grown girls
are employed. One man or two boys per tub are employed, according to
circumstances; and, if two boys, one pushes and the other pulls. The loosening
of the ore or coal, which is done by men or strong youths of sixteen years or
more, is also very weary work. The usual working-day is eleven to twelve hours,
often longer; in Scotland it reaches fourteen hours, and double time is
frequent, when all the employees are at work below ground twenty-four, and even
thirty-six hours at a stretch. Set times for meals are almost unknown, so that
these people eat when hunger and time permit.</p>
<p>The standard of living of the miners is in general described as fairly good
and their wages high in comparison with those of the agricultural labourers
surrounding them (who, however, live at starvation rates), except in certain
parts of Scotland and in the Irish mines, where great misery prevails. We shall
have occasion to return later to this statement, which, by the way, is merely
relative, implying comparison to the poorest class in all England. Meanwhile,
we shall consider the evils which arise from the present method of mining, and
the reader may judge whether any pay in money can indemnify the miner for such
suffering.</p>
<p>The children and young people who are employed in transporting coal and
iron-stone all complain of being overtired. Even in the most recklessly
conducted industrial establishments there is no such universal and exaggerated
overwork. The whole report proves this, with a number of examples on every
page. It is constantly happening that children throw themselves down on the
stone hearth or the floor as soon as they reach home, fall asleep at once
without being able to take a bite of food, and have to be washed and put to bed
while asleep; it even happens that they lie down on the way home, and are found
by their parents late at night asleep on the road. It seems to be a universal
practice among these children to spend Sunday in bed to recover in some degree
from the overexertion of the week. Church and school are visited by but few,
and even of these the teachers complain of their great sleepiness and the want
of all eagerness to learn. The same thing is true of the elder girls and women.
They are overworked in the most brutal manner. This weariness, which is almost
always carried to a most painful pitch, cannot fail to affect the constitution.
The first result of such overexertion is the diversion of vitality to the
one-sided development of the muscles, so that those especially of the arms,
legs, and back, of the shoulders and chest, which are chiefly called into
activity in pushing and pulling, attain an uncommonly vigorous development,
while all the rest of the body suffers and is atrophied from want of
nourishment. More than all else the stature suffers, being stunted and
retarded; nearly all miners are short, except those of Leicestershire and
Warwickshire, who work under exceptionally favourable conditions. Further,
among boys as well as girls, puberty is retarded, among the former often until
the eighteenth year; indeed, a nineteen years old boy appeared before
Commissioner Symons, showing no evidence beyond that of the teeth, that he was
more than eleven or twelve years old. This prolongation of the period of
childhood is at bottom nothing more than a sign of checked development, which
does not fail to bear fruit in later years. Distortions of the legs, knees bent
inwards and feet bent outwards, deformities of the spinal column and other
malformations, appear the more readily in constitutions thus weakened, in
consequence of the almost universally constrained position during work; and
they are so frequent that in Yorkshire and Lancashire, as in Northumberland and
Durham, the assertion is made by many witnesses, not only by physicians, that a
miner may be recognised by his shape among a hundred other persons. The women
seem to suffer especially from this work, and are seldom, if ever, as straight
as other women. There is testimony here, too, to the fact that deformities of
the pelvis and consequent difficult, even fatal, child-bearing arise from the
work of women in the mines. But apart from these local deformities, the
coal-miners suffer from a number of special affections easily explained by the
nature of the work. Diseases of the digestive organs are first in order; want
of appetite, pains in the stomach, nausea, and vomiting, are most frequent,
with violent thirst, which can be quenched only with the dirty, lukewarm water
of the mine; the digestion is checked and all the other affections are thus
invited. Diseases of the heart, especially hypertrophy, inflammation of the
heart and pericardium, contraction of the auriculo-ventricular communications
and the entrance of the aorta are also mentioned repeatedly as diseases of the
miners, and are readily explained by overwork; and the same is true of the
almost universal rupture which is a direct consequence of protracted
overexertion. In part from the same cause and in part from the bad, dust-filled
atmosphere mixed with carbonic acid and hydrocarbon gas, which might so readily
be avoided, there arise numerous painful and dangerous affections of the lungs,
especially asthma, which in some districts appears in the fortieth, in others
in the thirtieth year in most of the miners, and makes them unfit for work in a
short time. Among those employed in wet workings the oppression in the chest
naturally appears much earlier; in some districts of Scotland between the
twentieth and thirtieth years, during which time the affected lungs are
especially susceptible to inflammations and diseases of a feverish nature. The
peculiar disease of workers of this sort is "black spittle", which arises from
the saturation of the whole lung with coal particles, and manifests itself in
general debility, headache, oppression of the chest, and thick, black mucous
expectoration. In some districts this disease appears in a mild form; in
others, on the contrary, it is wholly incurable, especially in Scotland. Here,
besides the symptoms just mentioned, which appear in an intensified form,
short, wheezing breathing, rapid pulse (exceeding 100 per minute), and abrupt
coughing, with increasing leanness and debility, speedily make the patient
unfit for work. Every case of this disease ends fatally. Dr. Mackellar, in
Pencaitland, East Lothian, testified that in all the coal-mines which are
properly ventilated this disease is unknown, while it frequently happens that
miners who go from well- to ill-ventilated mines are seized by it. The
profit-greed of mine owners which prevents the use of ventilators is therefore
responsible for the fact, that this working-men's disease exists at all.
Rheumatism, too, is, with the exception of the Warwick and Leicestershire
workers, a universal disease of the coal-miners, and arises especially from the
frequently damp working-places. The consequence of all these diseases is that,
in all districts <i>without exception,</i> the coal-miners age early and
become unfit for work soon after the fortieth year, though this is different in
different places. A coal-miner who can follow his calling after the 45th or
50th year is a very great rarity indeed. It is universally recognised that such
workers enter upon old age at forty. This applies to those who loosen the coal
from the bed; the loaders, who have constantly to lift heavy blocks of coal
into the tubs, age with the twenty-eighth or thirtieth year, so that it is
proverbial in the coal-mining districts that the loaders are old before they
are young. That this premature old age is followed by the early death of the
colliers is a matter of course, and a man who reaches sixty is a great
exception among them. Even in South Staffordshire, where the mines are
comparatively wholesome, few men reach their fifty-first year. Along with this
early superannuation of the workers we naturally find, just as in the case of
the mills, frequent lack of employment of the elder men, who are often
supported by very young children. If we sum up briefly the results of the work
in coal-mines, we find, as Dr. Southwood Smith, one of the commissioners, does,
that through prolonged childhood on the one hand and premature age on the
other, that period of life in which the human being is in full possession of
his powers, the period of manhood, is greatly shortened, while the length of
life in general is below the average. This, too, on the debit side of the
bourgeoisie's reckoning! </p>
<p>All this deals only with the average of the English coal-mines. But there
are many in which the state of things is much worse, those, namely, in which
thin seams of coal are worked. The coal would be too expensive if a part of the
adjacent sand and clay were removed; so the mine owners permit only the seams
to be worked; whereby the passages which elsewhere are four or five feet high
and more are here kept so low that to stand upright in them is not to be
thought of. The working-man lies on his side and loosens the coal with his
pick; resting upon his elbow as a pivot, whence follow inflammations of the
joint, and in cases where he is forced to kneel, of the knee also. The women
and children who have to transport the coal crawl upon their hands and knees,
fastened to the tub by a harness and chain (which frequently passes between the
legs), while a man behind pushes with hands and head. The pushing with the head
engenders local irritations, painful swellings, and ulcers. In many cases, too,
the shafts are wet, so that these workers have to crawl through dirty or salt
water several inches deep, being thus exposed to a special irritation of the
skin. It can be readily imagined how greatly the diseases already peculiar to
the miners are fostered by this especially frightful, slavish toil. </p>
<p>But these are not all the evils which descend upon the head of the
coal-miner. In the whole British Empire there is no occupation in which a man
may meet his end in so many diverse ways as in this one. The coal-mine is the
scene of a multitude of the most terrifying calamities, and these come directly
from the selfishness of the bourgeoisie. The hydrocarbon gas which develops so
freely in these mines, forms, when combined with atmospheric air, an explosive
which takes fire upon coming into contact with a flame, and kills every one
within its reach. Such explosions take place, in one mine or another, nearly
every day; on September 28th, 1844, one killed 96 men in Haswell Colliery,
Durham. The carbonic acid gas, which also develops in great quantities,
accumulates in the deeper parts of the mine, frequently reaching the height of
a man, and suffocates every one who gets into it. The doors which separate the
sections of the mines are meant to prevent the propagation of explosions and
the movement of the gases; but since they are entrusted to small children, who
often fall asleep or neglect them, this means of prevention is illusory. A
proper ventilation of the mines by means of fresh air-shafts could almost
entirely remove the injurious effects of both these gases. But for this purpose
the bourgeoisie has no money to spare, preferring to command the working-men to
use the Davy lamp, which is wholly useless because of its dull light, and is,
therefore, usually replaced by a candle. If an explosion occurs, the
recklessness of the miner is blamed, though the bourgeois might have made the
explosion well-nigh impossible by supplying good ventilation. Further, every
few days the roof of a working falls in, and buries or mangles the workers
employed in it. It is the interest of the bourgeois to have the seams worked
out as completely as possible, and hence the accidents of this sort. Then, too,
the ropes by which the men descend into the mines are often rotten, and break,
so that the unfortunates fall, and are crushed. All these accidents, and I have
no room for special cases, carry off yearly, according to the <i>Mining
Journal</i>, some fourteen hundred human beings. The <i>Manchester
Guardian</i> reports at least two or three accidents every week for Lancashire
alone. In nearly all mining districts the people composing the coroner's juries
are, in almost all cases, dependent upon the mine owners, and where this is not
the case, immemorial custom insures that the verdict shall be: "Accidental
Death". Besides, the jury takes very little interest in the state of the mine,
because it does not understand anything about the matter. But the Children's
Employment Commission does not hesitate to make the mine owners directly
responsible for the greater number of these cases. </p>
<p>As to the education and morals of the mining population, they are, according
to the Children's Employment Commission, pretty good in Cornwall, and excellent
in Alston Moor; in the coal districts, in general, they are, on the contrary,
reported as on an excessively low plane. The workers live in the country in
neglected regions, and if they do their weary work, no human being outside the
police force troubles himself about them. Hence, and from the tender age at
which children are put to work, it follows that their mental education is
wholly neglected. The day schools are not within their reach, the evening and
Sunday schools mere shams, the teachers worthless. Hence, few can read and
still fewer write. The only point upon which their eyes are as yet open is the
fact that their wages are far too low for their hateful and dangerous work. To
church they go seldom or never; all the clergy complain of their irreligion as
beyond comparison. As a matter of fact, their ignorance of religious and of
secular things, alike, is such that the ignorance of the factory operatives,
shown in numerous examples in the foregoing pages, is trifling in comparison
with it. The categories of religion are known to them only from the terms of
their oaths. Their morality is destroyed by their work itself. That the
overwork of all miners must engender drunkenness is self- evident. As to their
sexual relations, men, women, and children work in the mines, in many cases,
wholly naked, and in most cases, nearly so, by reason of the prevailing heat,
and the consequences in the dark, lonely mines may be imagined. The number of
illegitimate children is here disproportionately large, and indicates what goes
on among the half-savage population below ground; but proves too, that the
illegitimate intercourse of the sexes has not here, as in the great cities,
sunk to the level of prostitution. The labour of women entails the same
consequences as in the factories, dissolves the family, and makes the mother
totally incapable of household work.</p>
<p>When the Children's Employment Commission's Report was laid before
Parliament, Lord Ashley hastened to bring in a bill wholly forbidding the work
of women in the mines, and greatly limiting that of children. The bill was
adopted, but has remained a dead letter in most districts, because no mine
inspectors were appointed to watch over its being carried into effect. The
evasion of the law is very easy in the country districts in which the mines are
situated; and no one need be surprised that the Miners' Union laid before the
Home Secretary an official notice, last year, that in the Duke of Hamilton's
coal-mines in Scotland, more than sixty women were at work; or that the
<i>Manchester Guardian</i> reported that a girl perished in an explosion in a
mine near Wigan, and no one troubled himself further about the fact that an
infringement of the law was thus revealed. In single cases the employment of
women may have been discontinued, but in general the old state of things
remains as before. </p>
<p>These are, however, not all the afflictions known to the coal-miners. The
bourgeoisie, not content with ruining the health of these people, keeping them
in danger of sudden loss of life, robbing them of all opportunity for
education, plunders them in other directions in the most shameless manner. The
truck system is here the rule, not the exception, and is carried on in the most
direct and undisguised manner. The cottage system, likewise, is universal, and
here almost a necessity; but it is used here, too, for the better plundering of
the workers. To these means of oppression must be added all sorts of direct
cheating. While coal is sold by weight, the worker's wages are reckoned chiefly
by measure; and when his tub is not perfectly full he receives no pay whatever,
while he gets not a farthing for overmeasure. If there is more than a specified
quantity of dust in the tub, a matter which depends much less upon the miner
than upon the nature of the seam, he not only loses his whole wage but is fined
besides. The fine system in general is so highly perfected in the coal-mines,
that a poor devil who has worked the whole week and comes for his wages,
sometimes learns from the overseer, who fines at discretion and without
summoning the workers, that he not only has no wages but must pay so and so
much in fines extra! The overseer has, in general, absolute power over wages;
he notes the work done, and can please himself as to what he pays the worker,
who is forced to take his word. In some mines, where the pay is according to
weight, false decimal scales are used, whose weights are not subject to the
inspection of the authorities; in one coal-mine there was actually a regulation
that any workman who intended to complain of the falseness of the scales
<i>must give notice to the overseer three weeks in advance! </i>In many
districts, especially in the North of England, it is customary to engage the
workers by the year; they pledge themselves to work for no other employer
during that time, but the mine owner by no means pledges himself to give them
work, so that they are often without it for months together, and if they seek
elsewhere, they are sent to the treadmill for six weeks for breach of contract.
In other contracts, work to the amount of 26s. every 14 days, is promised the
miners, but not furnished; in others still, the employers advance the miners
small sums to be worked out afterwards, thus binding the debtors to themselves.
In the North, the custom is general of keeping the payment of wages one week
behindhand, chaining the miners in this way to their work.<a id="p540"></a>
And to complete the slavery of these enthralled workers, nearly all the
Justices of the Peace in the coal districts are mine owners themselves, or
relatives or friends of mine owners, and possess almost unlimited power in
these poor, uncivilised regions where there are few newspapers, these few in
the service of the ruling class, and but little other agitation. It is almost
beyond conception how these poor coal-miners have been plundered and tyrannised
over by Justices of the Peace acting as judges in their own cause. </p>
<p>So it went on for a long time. The workers did not know any better than that
they were there for the purpose of being swindled out of their very lives. But
gradually, even among them, and especially in the factory districts, where
contact with the more intelligent operatives could not fail of its effect,
there arose a spirit of opposition to the shameless oppression of the "coal
kings". The men began to form Unions and strike from time to time. In civilised
districts they joined the Chartists body and soul. The great coal district of
the North of England, shut off from all industrial intercourse, remained
backward until, after many efforts, partly of the Chartists and partly of the
more intelligent miners themselves, a general spirit of opposition arose in
1843. Such a movement seized the workers of Northumberland and Durham that they
placed themselves at the forefront of a general Union of coal-miners throughout
the kingdom, and appointed W. P. Roberts, a Chartist solicitor, of Bristol,
their "Attorney General", he having distinguished himself in earlier Chartist
trials. The Union soon spread over a great majority of the districts; agents
were appointed in all directions, who held meetings everywhere and secured new
members; at the first conference of delegates, in Manchester, in 1844, there
were 60,000 members represented, and at Glasgow, six months later, at the
second conference, 100,000. Here all the affairs of the coal-miners were
discussed and decisions as to the greater strikes arrived at. Several journals
were founded, especially the <i>Miner's Advocate</i> at Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
for defending the rights of the miners. On March 31st, 1844, the contracts of
all the miners of Northumberland and Durham expired. Roberts was empowered to
draw up a new agreement, in which the men demanded: (1) Payment by weight
instead of measure; (2) Determination of weight by means of ordinary scales
subject to the public inspectors; (3) Half-yearly renewal of contracts; (4)
Abolition of the fines system and payment according to work actually done; (5)
The employers to guarantee to miners in their exclusive service at least four
days' work per week, or wages for the same. This agreement was submitted to the
"coal kings", and a deputation appointed to negotiate with them; they answered,
however, that for them the Union did not exist, that they had to deal with
single workmen only, and should never recognise the Union. They also submitted
an agreement of their own which ignored all the foregoing points, and was,
naturally, refused by the miners. War was thus declared. On March 31st, 1844,
40,000 miners laid down their picks, and every mine in the county stood empty.
The funds of the Union were so considerable that for several months a weekly
contribution of 2s. 6d. could be assured to each family. While the miners were
thus putting the patience of their masters to the test, Roberts organised with
incomparable perseverance both strike and agitation, arranged for the holding
of meetings, traversed England from one end to the other, preached peaceful and
legal agitation, and carried on a crusade against the despotic Justices of the
Peace and truck masters, such as had never been known in England. This he had
begun at the beginning of the year. Wherever a miner had been condemned by a
Justice of the Peace, he obtained a <i>habeas corpus</i> from the Court of
Queen's bench, brought his client to London, and always secured an acquittal.
Thus, January 13th, Judge Williams of Queen's bench acquitted three miners
condemned by the Justices of the Peace of Bilston, South Staffordshire; the
offence of these people was that they refused to work in a place which
threatened to cave in, and had actually caved in before their return! On an
earlier occasion, Judge Patteson had acquitted six working-men, so that the
name Roberts began to be a terror to the mine owners. In Preston four of his
clients were in jail. In the first week of January he proceeded thither to
investigate the case on the spot, but found, when he arrived, the condemned all
released before the expiration of the sentence. In Manchester there were seven
in jail; Roberts obtained a <i>habeas corpus</i> and acquittal for all from
Judge Wightman. In Prescott nine coal-miners were in jail, accused of creating
a disturbance in St. Helens, South Lancashire, and awaiting trial; when Roberts
arrived upon the spot, they were released at once. All this took place in the
first half of February. In April, Roberts released a miner from jail in Derby,
four in Wakefield, and four in Leicester. So it went on for a time until these
Dogberries came to have some respect for the miners. The truck system shared
the same fate. One after another Roberts brought the disreputable mine owners
before the courts, and compelled the reluctant Justices of the Peace to condemn
them; such dread of this “lightning” “Attorney General”
who seemed to be everywhere at once spread among them, that at Belper, for
instance, upon Roberts' arrival, a truck firm published the following notice:
</p>
<h5>N O T I C E!<br>
Pentrich Colliery</h5>
<p class="fst" style="margin-left: 96px; margin-right: 96px;">Messrs. Haslam
think it right (to prevent mistake), to give notice that all men employed at
their colliery will receive their wages wholly in money, and be at liberty to
spend it where they like. If they buy at Messrs. Haslam's shop they will be
supplied (as heretofore) at wholesale prices; but they are not expected to buy
there, and will have the same work and wages whether they go to that shop or
any other.</p>
<p>This triumph aroused the greatest jubilation throughout the English
working-class, and brought the Union a mass of new members. Meanwhile the
strike in the North was proceeding. Not a hand stirred, and Newcastle, the
chief coal port, was so stripped of its commodity that coal had to be brought
from the Scotch coast, in spite of the proverb. At first, while the Union's
funds held out, all went well, but towards summer the struggle became much more
painful for the miners. The greatest want prevailed among them; they had no
money, for the contributions of the workers of all branches of industry in
England availed little among the vast number of strikers, who were forced to
borrow from the small shopkeepers at a heavy loss. The whole press, with the
single exception of the few proletarian journals, was against them; the
bourgeois, even the few among them who might have had enough sense of justice
to support the miners, learnt from the corrupt Liberal and Conservative sheets
only lies about them. A deputation of twelve miners who went to London received
a sum from the proletariat there, but this, too, availed little among the mass
who needed support. Yet, in spite of all this, the miners remained steadfast,
and what is even more significant, were quiet and peaceable in the face of all
the hostilities and provocation of the mine owners and their faithful servants.
No act of revenge was carried out, not a renegade was maltreated, not one
single theft committed. Thus the strike had continued well on towards four
months, and the mine owners still had no prospect of getting the upper hand.
One way was, however, still open to them. They remembered the cottage system;
it occurred to them that the houses of the rebellious spirits were THEIR
property. In July, notice to quit was served the workers, and, in a week, the
whole forty thousand were put out of doors. This measure was carried out with
revolting cruelty. The sick, the feeble, old men and little children, even
women in child-birth, were mercilessly turned from their beds and cast into the
roadside ditches. One agent dragged by the hair from her bed, and into the
street, a woman in the pangs of child-birth. Soldiers and police in crowds were
present, ready to fire at the first symptom of resistance, on the slightest
hint of the Justices of the Peace, who had brought about the whole brutal
procedure. This, too, the working-men endured without resistance. The hope had
been that the men would use violence; they were spurred on with all force to
infringements of the laws, to furnish an excuse for making an end of the strike
by the intervention of the military. The homeless miners, remembering the
warnings of their Attorney General, remained unmoved, set up their household
goods upon the moors or the harvested fields, and held out. Some, who had no
other place, encamped on the roadsides and in ditches, others upon land
belonging to other people, whereupon they were prosecuted, and, having caused
"damage of the value of a halfpenny", were fined a pound, and, being unable to
pay it, worked it out on the treadmill. Thus they lived eight weeks and more of
the wet fag-end of last summer under the open sky with their families, with no
further shelter for themselves and their little ones than the calico curtains
of their beds; with no other help than the scanty allowances of their Union and
the fast shrinking credit with the small dealers. Hereupon Lord Londonderry,
who owns considerable mines in Durham, threatened the small tradesmen in "his"
town of Seaham with his most high displeasure if they should continue to give
credit to "his" rebellious workers. This "noble" lord made himself the first
clown of the turnout in consequence of the ridiculous, pompous, ungrammatical
ukases addressed to the workers, which he published from time to time, with no
other result than the merriment of the nation. When none of their efforts
produced any effect, the mine owners imported, at great expense, hands from
Ireland and such remote parts of Wales as have as yet no labour movement. And
when the competition of workers against workers was thus restored, the strength
of the strikers collapsed. The mine owners obliged them to renounce the Union,
abandon Roberts, and accept the conditions laid down by the employers. Thus
ended at the close of September the great five months' battle of the
coal-miners against the mine owners, a battle fought on the part of the
oppressed with .an endurance, courage, intelligence, and coolness which demands
the highest admiration. What a degree of true human culture, of enthusiasm and
strength of character, such a battle implies on the part of men who, as we have
seen in the Children's Employment Commission's Report, were described as late
as 1840, as being thoroughly brutal and wanting in moral sense! But how hard,
too, must have been the pressure which brought these forty thousand colliers to
rise as one man and to fight out the battle like an army not only
well-disciplined but enthusiastic, an army possessed of one single
determination, with the greatest coolness and composure, to a point beyond
which further resistance would have been madness. And what a battle! Not
against visible, mortal enemies, but against hunger, want, misery, and
homelessness, against their own passions provoked to madness by the brutality
of wealth. If they had revolted with violence, they, the unarmed and
defenceless, would have been shot down, and a day or two would have decided the
victory of the owners. This law-abiding reserve was no fear of the constable's
staff, it was the result of deliberation, the best proof of the intelligence
and self-control of the working-men.</p>
<p>Thus were the working-men forced once more, in spite of their unexampled
endurance, to succumb to the might of capital. But the fight had not been in
vain. First of all, this nineteen weeks' strike had tom the miners of the North
of England forever from the intellectual death in which they had hitherto lain;
they have left their sleep, are alert to defend their interests, and have
entered the movement of civilisation, and especially the movement of the
workers. The strike, which first brought to light the whole cruelty of the
owners, has established the opposition of the workers here, forever, and made
at least two-thirds of them Chartists; and the acquisition of thirty thousand
such determined, experienced men is certainly of great value to the Chartists.
Then, too, the endurance and law-abiding which characterised the whole strike,
coupled with the active agitation which accompanied it, has fixed public
attention upon the miners. On the occasion of the debate upon the export duty
on coal, Thomas Duncombe, the only decidedly Chartist member of the House of
Commons, brought up the condition of the coal-miners, had their petition read,
and by his speech forced the bourgeois journals to publish, at least in their
reports of Parliamentary proceedings, a correct statement of the case.
Immediately after the strike, occurred the explosion at Haswell; Roberts went
to London, demanded an audience with Peel, insisted as representative of the
miners upon a thorough investigation of the case, and succeeded in having the
first geological and chemical notabilities of England, Professors Lyell and
Faraday, commissioned to visit the spot. As several other explosions followed
in quick succession, and Roberts again laid the details before the Prime
Minister, the latter promised to propose the necessary measures for the
protection of the workers, if possible, in the next session of Parliament, i.
e., the present one of 1845. All this would not have been accomplished if these
workers had not, by means of the strike, proved themselves freedom-loving men
worthy of all respect, and if they had not engaged Roberts as their counsel.</p>
<p>Scarcely had it become known that the coal-miners of the North had been
forced to renounce the Union and discharge Roberts, when the miners of
Lancashire formed a Union of some ten thousand men, and guaranteed their
Attorney General a salary of £1,200 a year. In the autumn of last year they
collected more than £700, rather more than £200 of which they expended upon
salaries and judicial expenses, and the rest chiefly in support of men out of
work, either through want of employment or through dissensions with their
employers. Thus the working-men are constantly coming to see more clearly that,
united, they too are a respectable power, and can, in the last extremity, defy
even the might of the bourgeoisie. And this insight, the gain of all labour
movements, has been won for all the miners of England by the Union and the
strike of 1844. In a very short time the difference of intelligence and energy
which now exists in favour of the factory operatives will have vanished, and
the miners of the kingdom will be able to stand abreast of them in every
respect. Thus one piece of standing ground after another is undermined beneath
the feet of the bourgeoisie; and how long will it be before their whole social
and political edifice collapses with the basis upon which it rests?</p>
<p>But the bourgeoisie will not take warning. The resistance of the miners does
but embitter it the more. Instead of appreciating this forward step in the
general movement of the workers, the property-holding class saw in it only a
source of rage against a class of people who are fools enough to declare
themselves no longer submissive to the treatment they had hitherto received. It
saw in the just demands of the non-possessing workers only impertinent
discontent, mad rebellion against "Divine and human order", and, in the best
case, a success (to be resisted by the bourgeoisie with all its might) won by
"ill-intentioned demagogues who live by agitation and are too lazy to work". It
sought, of course, without success, to represent to the workers that Roberts
and the Union's agents, whom the Union very naturally had to pay, were insolent
swindlers, who drew the last farthing from the working-men's pockets. When such
insanity prevails in the property-holding class, when it is so blinded by its
momentary profit that it no longer has eyes for the most conspicuous signs of
the times, surely all hope of a peaceful solution of the social question for
England must be abandoned. The only possible solution is a violent revolution,
which cannot fail to take place.</p>

<p>As the coal and iron mines are usually worked by the same people, a part of
the miners attributed to the coal-mines, and a very considerable part of those
mentioned under the last heading are to be attributed to the iron mines.

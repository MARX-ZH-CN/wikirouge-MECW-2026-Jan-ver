<p class="title">Condition of the Working Class in England, by Engels, 1845</p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The history of the proletariat in England begins with the second half of the
last century, with the invention of the steam-engine and of machinery for
working cotton. These inventions gave rise, as is well known, to an industrial
revolution, a revolution which altered the whole civil society; one, the
historical importance of which is only now beginning to be recognised. England
is the classic soil of this transformation, which was all the mightier, the
more silently it proceeded; and England is, therefore, the classic land of its
chief product also, the proletariat. Only in England can the proletariat be
studied in all its relations and from all sides. </p>
<p>We have not, here and now, to deal with the history of this revolution, nor
with its vast importance for the present and the future. Such a delineation
must be reserved for a future, more comprehensive work. For the moment, we must
limit ourselves to the little that is necessary for understanding the facts
that follow, for comprehending the present state of the English proletariat.
</p>
<p>Before the introduction of machinery, the spinning and weaving of raw
materials was carried on in the workingman's home. Wife and daughter spun the
yarn that the father wove or that they sold, if he did not work it up himself.
These weaver families lived in the country in the neighbourhood of the towns,
and could get on fairly well with their wages, because the home market was
almost the only one and the crushing power of competition that came later, with
the conquest of foreign markets and the extension of trade, did not yet press
upon wages. There was, further, a constant increase in the demand for the home
market, keeping pace with the slow increase in population and employing all the
workers; and there was also the impossibility of vigorous competition of the
workers among themselves, consequent upon the rural dispersion of their homes.
So it was that the weaver was usually in a position to lay by something, and
rent a little piece of land, that he cultivated in his leisure hours, of which
he had as many as he chose to take, since he could weave whenever and as long
as he pleased. True, he was a bad farmer and managed his land inefficiently,
often obtaining but poor crops; nevertheless, he was no proletarian, he had a
stake in the country, he was permanently settled, and stood one step higher in
society than the English workman of today. </p>
<p>So the workers vegetated throughout a passably comfortable existence,
leading a righteous and peaceful life in all piety and probity; and their
material position was far better than that of their successors. They did not
need to overwork; they did no more than they chose to do, and yet earned what
they needed. They had leisure for healthful work in garden or field, work
which, in itself, was recreation for them, and they could take part besides in
the recreations and games of their neighbours, and all these games -- bowling,
cricket, football, etc., contributed to their physical health and vigour. They
were, for the most part, strong, well-built people, in whose physique little or
no difference from that of their peasant neighbours was discoverable. Their
children grew up in the fresh country air, and, if they could help their
parents at work, it was only occasionally; while of eight or twelve hours work
for them there was no question. </p>
<p>What the moral and intellectual character of this class was may be guessed.
Shut off from the towns, which they never entered, their yarn and woven stuff
being delivered to travelling agents for payment of wages -- so shut off that
old people who lived quite in the neighborhood of the town never went thither
until they were robbed of their trade by the introduction of machinery and
obliged to look about them in the towns for work -- the weavers stood upon the
moral and intellectual plane of the yeomen with whom they were usually
immediately connected through their little holdings. They regarded their
squire, the greatest landholder of the region, as their natural superior; they
asked advice of him, laid their small disputes before him for settlement, and
gave him all honour, as this patriarchal relation involved. They were
"respectable" people, good husbands and fathers, led moral lives because they
had no temptation to be immoral, there being no groggeries or low houses in
their vicinity, and because the host, at whose inn they now and then quenched
their thirst, was also a respectable man, usually a large tenant-farmer who
took pride in his good order, good beer, and early hours. They had their
children the whole day at home, and brought them up in obedience and the fear
of God; the patriarchal relationship remained undisturbed so long as the
children were unmarried. The young people grew up in idyllic simplicity and
intimacy with their playmates until they married; and even though sexual
intercourse before marriage almost unfailingly took place, this happened only
when the moral obligation of marriage was recognised on both sides, and a
subsequent wedding made everything good. In short, the English industrial
workers of those days lived and thought after the fashion still to be found
here and there in Germany, in retirement and seclusion, without mental activity
and without violent fluctuations in their position in life. They could rarely
read and far more rarely write; went regularly to church, never talked
politics, never conspired, never thought, delighted in physical exercises,
listened with inherited reverence when the Bible was read, and were, in their
unquestioning humility, exceedingly well-disposed towards the "superior"
classes. But intellectually, they were dead; lived only for their petty,
private interest, for their looms and gardens, and knew nothing of the mighty
movement which, beyond their horizon, was sweeping through mankind. They were
comfortable in their silent vegetation, and but for the industrial revolution
they would never have emerged from this existence, which, cosily romantic as it
was, was nevertheless not worthy of human beings. In truth, they were not human
beings; they were merely toiling machines in the service of the few aristocrats
who had guided history down to that time. The industrial revolution has simply
carried this out to its logical end by making the workers machines pure and
simple, taking from them the last trace of independent activity, and so forcing
them to think and demand a position worthy of men. As in France politics, so in
England manufacture and the movement of civil society in general drew into the
whirl of history the last classes which had remained sunk in apathetic
indifference to the universal interests of mankind. </p>
<p>The first invention which gave rise to a radical change in the state of the
English workers was the jenny, invented in the year 1764 by a weaver, James
Hargreaves, of Stanhill, near Blackburn, in North Lancashire. This machine was
the rough beginning of the later invented mule, and was moved by hand. Instead
of one spindle like the ordinary spinning-wheel, it carried sixteen or eighteen
manipulated by a single workman. This invention made it possible to deliver
more yarn than heretofore. Whereas, though one weaver had employed three
spinners, there had never been enough yarn, and the weaver had often been
obliged to wait for it, there was now more yarn to be had than could be woven
by the available workers. The demand for woven goods, already increasing, rose
yet more in consequence of the cheapness of these goods, which cheapness, in
turn, was the outcome of the diminished cost of producing the yarn. More
weavers were needed, and weavers' wages rose. Now that the weaver could earn
more at his loom, he gradually abandoned his farming, and gave his whole time
to weaving. At that time a family of four grown persons and two children (who
were set to spooling) could earn, with eight hours' daily work, four pounds
sterling in a week, and often more if trade was good and work pressed. It
happened often enough that a single weaver earned two pounds a week at his
loom. By degrees the class of farming weavers wholly disappeared, and was
merged in the newly arising class of weavers who lived wholly upon wages, had
no property whatever, not even the pretended property of a holding, and so
became workingmen, proletarians. Moreover, the old relation between spinner and
weaver was destroyed. Hitherto, so far as this had been possible, yarn had been
spun and woven under one roof. Now that the jenny as well as the loom required
a strong hand, men began to spin, and whole families lived by spinning, while
others laid the antiquated, superseded spinning-wheel aside; and, if they had
not means of purchasing a jenny, were forced to live upon the wages of the
father alone. Thus began with spinning and weaving that division of labour
which has since been so infinitely perfected. </p>
<p>While the industrial proletariat was thus developing with the first still
very imperfect machine, the same machine gave rise to the agricultural
proletariat. There had, hitherto, been a vast number of small landowners,
yeomen, who had vegetated in the same unthinking quiet as their neighbours, the
farming weavers. They cultivated their scraps of land quite after the ancient
and inefficient fashion of their ancestors, and opposed every change with the
obstinacy peculiar to such creatures of habit, after remaining stationary from
generation to generation. Among them were many small holders also, not tenants
in the present sense of the word, but people who had their land handed down
from their fathers, either by hereditary lease, or by force of ancient custom,
and had hitherto held it as securely as if it had actually been their own
property. When the industrial workers withdrew from agriculture, a great number
of small holdings fell idle, and upon these the new class of large tenants
established themselves, tenants-at-will, holding fifty, one hundred, two
hundred or more acres, liable to be turned out at the end of the year, but able
by improved tillage and larger farming to increase the yield of the land. They
could sell their produce more cheaply than the yeoman, for whom nothing
remained when his farm no longer supported him but to sell it, procure a jenny
or a loom, or take service as an agricultural labourer in the employ of a large
farmer. His inherited slowness and the inefficient methods of cultivation
bequeathed by his ancestors, and above which he could not rise, left him no
alternative when forced to compete with men who managed their holdings on
sounder principles and with all the advantages bestowed by farming on a large
scale and the investment of capital for the improvement of the soil. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the industrial movement did not stop here. Single capitalists
began to set up spinning jennies in great buildings and to use water-power for
driving them, so placing themselves in a position to diminish the number of
workers, and sell their yarn more cheaply than single spinners could do who
moved their own machines by hand. There were constant improvements in the
jenny, so that machines continually became antiquated, and must be altered or
even laid aside; and though the capitalists could hold out by the application
of water-power even with the old machinery, for the single spinner this was
impossible. And the factory system, the beginning of which was thus made,
received a fresh extension in 1767, through the spinning throstle invented by
Richard Arkwright, a barber, in Preston, in North Lancashire. After the
steam-engine, this is the most important mechanical invention of the 18th
century. It was calculated from the beginning for mechanical motive power, and
was based upon wholly new principles. By the combination of the peculiarities
of the jenny and throstle, Samuel Crompton, of Firwood, Lancashire, contrived
the mule in 1785, and as Arkwright invented the carding engine, and preparatory
("slubbing and roving") frames about the same time, the factory system became
the prevailing one for the spinning of cotton. By means of trifling
modifications these machines were gradually adapted to the spinning of flax,
and so to the superseding of handwork here, too. But even then, the end was not
yet. In the closing years of the last century, Dr. Cartwright, a country
parson, had invented the power-loom, and about 1804 had so far perfected it,
that it could successfully compete with the hand-weaver; and all this machinery
was made doubly important by James Watt's steam-engine, invented in 1764 and
used for supplying motive power for spinning since 1785. </p>
<p>With these inventions, since improved from year to year, the victory of
machine-work over hand-work in the chief branches of English industry was won;
and the history of the latter from that time forward simply relates how the
hand-workers have been driven by machinery from one position after another. The
consequences of this were, on the one hand, a rapid fall in price of all
manufactured commodities, prosperity of commerce and manufacture, the conquest
of nearly all the unprotected foreign markets, the sudden multiplication of
capital and national wealth; on the other hand, a still more rapid
multiplication of the proletariat, the destruction of all property-holding and
of all security of employment for the working-class, demoralisation, political
excitement, and all those facts so highly repugnant to Englishmen in
comfortable circumstances, which we shall have to consider in the following
pages. Having already seen what a transformation in the social condition of the
lower classes a single such clumsy machine as the jenny had wrought, there is
no cause for surprise as to that which a complete and interdependent system of
finely adjusted machinery has brought about, machinery which receives raw
material and turns out woven goods. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, let us trace the development of English manufacturers<a href="#1"><sup class="enote">[1]</sup></a><a id="[1]"></a> somewhat more minutely, beginning with the
cotton industry. In the years 1771-1775, there were annually imported into
England rather less than 5,000,000 pounds of raw cotton; in the year 1841 there
were imported 528,000,000 pounds, and the import for 1844 will reach at least
600,000,000 pounds. In 1854 England exported 556,000,000 yards of woven cotton
goods, 76,500,000 pounds of cotton yarn, and cotton hosiery to the value of
£1,200,000. In the same year over 8,000,000 mule spindles were at work, 110,000
power and 250,000 hand-looms, throstle spindles not included, in the service of
the cotton industry; and, according to McCulloch's reckoning nearly a million
and a half human beings were supported by this branch, of whom but 220,000
worked in the mills; the power used in these mills was steam, equivalent to
53,000 horsepower, and water, equivalent to 11,000 horsepower. At present these
figures are far from adequate, and it may be safely assumed that, in the year
1845, the power and number of the machines and the number of the workers is
greater by one-half than it was in 1834. The chief centre of this industry is
Lancashire, where it originated; it has thoroughly revolutionised this county,
converting it from an obscure, ill-cultivated swamp into a busy, lively region,
multiplying its population tenfold in eighty years, and causing giant cities
such as Liverpool and Manchester, containing together 700,000 inhabitants, and
their neighbouring towns, Bolton with 60,000, Rochdale with 75,000, Oldham with
50,000, Preston with 60,000, Ashton and Stalybridge with 40,000, and a whole
list of other manufacturing towns to spring up as if by a magic touch. The
history of South Lancashire contains some of the greatest marvels of modern
times, yet no one ever mentions them and all these miracles are the product of
the cotton industry. Glasgow, too, the centre for the cotton district of
Scotland, for Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire, has increased in population from
30,000 to 300,000 since the introduction of the industry. The hosiery
manufacture of Nottingham and Derby also received one fresh impulse from the
lower price of yarn, and a second one from an improvement of the stocking loom,
by means of which two stockings could be woven at once. The manufacture of
lace, too, became an important branch of industry after the invention of the
lace machine in 1777; soon after that date Lindley invented the point-net
machine, and in 1809 Heathcoat invented the bobbinnet machine, in consequence
of which the production of lace was greatly simplified, and the demand
increased proportionately in consequence of the diminished cost, so that now,
at least 200,000 persons are supported by this industry. Its chief centres are
Nottingham, Leicester, and the West of England, Wiltshire, Devonshire, etc. A
corresponding extension has taken place in the branches dependent upon the
cotton industry, in dyeing, bleaching, and printing. Bleaching by the
application of chlorine in place of the oxygen of the atmosphere, dyeing and
printing by the rapid development of chemistry, and printing by a series of
most brilliant mechanical inventions, received a yet greater advance which,
with the extension of these branches caused by the growth of the cotton
industry, raised them to a previously unknown degree of prosperity. </p>
<p>The same activity manifested itself in the manufacture of wool. This had
hitherto been the leading department of English industry, but the quantities
formerly produced are as nothing in comparison with that which is now
manufactured. In 1782 the whole wool crop of the preceding three years lay
unused for want of workers, and would have continued so to lie if the newly
invented machinery had not come to its assistance and spun it. The adaptation
of this machinery to the spinning of wool was most successfully accomplished.
Then began the same sudden development in the wool districts which we have
already seen in the cotton districts. In 1738 there were 75,000 pieces of
woollen cloth produced in the West Riding of Yorkshire; in 1817 there were
490,000 pieces, and so rapid was the extension of the industry that in 1854,
450,000 more pieces were produced than in 1825. In 1801, 101,000,000 pounds of
wool (7,000,000 pounds of. it imported) were worked up; in 1855, 180,000,000
pounds were worked up, of which 42,000,000 pounds were imported. The principal
centre of this industry is the West Riding of Yorkshire, where, especially at
Bradford, long English wool is converted into worsted yarns, etc., while in the
other cities, Leeds, Halifax, Huddersfield, etc., short wool is converted into
hard-spun yarn and cloth. Then come the adjacent part of Lancashire, the region
of Rochdale, where in addition to the cotton industry much flannel is produced,
and the West of England, which supplies the finest cloths. Here also the growth
of population is worthy of observation:</p>

<p>A population which, since 1831, must have increased at least 20 to 25 per
cent further. In 1835 the spinning of wool employed in the United Kingdom 1,313
mills, with 71,300 workers, these last being but a small portion of the
multitude who are supported directly or indirectly by the manufacture of wool,
and excluding nearly all weavers. </p>
<p>Progress in the linen trade developed later, because the nature of the raw
material made the application of spinning machinery very difficult. Attempts
had been made in the last years of the last century in Scotland, but the
Frenchman Girard, who introduced flax spinning in 1810, was the first who
succeeded practically, and even Girard's machines first attained on British
soil the importance they deserved by means of improvements which they underwent
in England, and of their universal application in Leeds, Dundee, and Belfast.
From this time the British linen trade rapidly extended. In 1814, 3,000 tons of
flax were imported, in 1833, nearly 19,000 tons of flax and 3,400 tons of hemp.
The export of Irish linen to Great Britain rose from 52,000,000 yards in 1800
to 55,000,000 in 1825, of which a large part was re-exported. The export of
English and Scotch woven linen goods rose from 24,000,000 yards in 1820 to
51,000,000 yards in 1833. The number of flax spinning establishments in 1835
was 347, employing 33,000 workers, of which one-half were in the South of
Scotland, more than 60 in the West Riding of Yorkshire, Leeds, and its
environs, 25 in Belfast, Ireland, and the rest in Dorset and Lancashire.
Weaving is carried on in the South of Scotland, here and there in England, but
principally in Ireland. </p>
<p>With like success did the English turn their attention to the manufacture of
silk. Raw material was imported from Southern Europe and Asia ready spun, and
the chief labour lay in the twisting of fine threads. Until 1824 the heavy
import duty, four shillings per pound on raw material, greatly retarded the
development of the English silk industry, while only the markets of England and
the Colonies were protected for it. In that year the duty was reduced to one
penny, and the number of mills at once largely increased. In a single year the
number of throwing spindles rose from 780,000 to 1,180,000; and, although the
commercial crisis of 1825 crippled this branch of industry for the moment, yet
in 1827 more was produced than ever, the mechanical skill and experience of the
English having secured their twisting machinery the supremacy over the awkward
devices of their competitors. In 1835 the British Empire possessed 263 twisting
mills, employing 30,000 workers, located chiefly in Cheshire, in Macclesfield,
Congleton, and the surrounding districts, and in Manchester and Somersetshire.
Besides these, there are numerous mills for working up waste, from which a
peculiar article known as spun silk is manufactured, with which the English
supply even the Paris and Lyons weavers. The weaving of the silk so twisted and
spun is carried on in Paisley and elsewhere in Scotland, and in Spitalfields,
London, but also in Manchester and elsewhere. </p>
<p>Nor is the gigantic advance achieved in English manufacture since 1760
restricted to the production of clothing materials. The impulse, once given,
was communicated to all branches of industrial activity, and a multitude of
inventions wholly unrelated to those here cited received double importance from
the fact that they were made in the midst of the universal movement. But as
soon as the immeasurable importance of mechanical power was practically
demonstrated, every energy was concentrated in the effort to exploit this power
in all directions, and to exploit it in the interest of individual inventors
and manufacturers; and the demand for machinery, fuel, and materials called a
mass of workers and a number of trades into redoubled activity. The
steam-engine first gave importance to the broad coal-fields of England; the
production of machinery began now for the first time, and with it arose a new
interest in the iron mines which supplied raw material for it. The increased
consumption of wool stimulated English sheep breeding, and the growing
importation of wool, flax, and silk called forth an extension of the British
ocean carrying trade. Greatest of all was the growth of production of iron. The
rich iron deposits of the English hills had hitherto been little developed;
iron had always been smelted by means of charcoal, which became gradually more
expensive as agriculture improved and forests were cut away. The beginning of
the use of coke in iron smelting had been made in the last century, and in 1780
a new method was invented of converting into available wrought-iron
coke-smelted iron, which up to that time had been convertible into cast-iron
only. This process, known as "puddling", consisted in withdrawing the carbon
which had mixed with the iron during the process of smelting, and opened a
wholly new field for the production of English iron. Smelting furnaces were
built fifty times larger than before, the process of smelting was simplified by
the introduction of hot blasts, and iron could thus be produced so cheaply that
a multitude of objects which had before been made of stone or wood were now
made of iron. </p>
<p>In 1788, Thomas Paine, the famous democrat, built in Yorkshire the first
iron bridge, which was followed by a great number of others, so that now nearly
all bridges, especially for railroad traffic, are built of cast-iron, while in
London itself a bridge across the Thames, the Southwark bridge, has been built
of this material. Iron pillars, supports for machinery, etc., are universally
used, and since the introduction of gas-lighting and railroads, new outlets for
English iron products are opened. Nails and screws gradually came to be made by
machinery. Huntsman, a Sheffielder, discovered in 1740 a method for casting
steel, by which much labour was saved, and the production of wholly new cheap
goods rendered practicable; and through the greater purity of the material
placed at its disposal, and the more perfect tools, new machinery and minute
division of labour, the metal trade of England now first attained importance.
The population of Birmingham grew from 73,000 in 1801 to 200,000 in 1844; that
of Sheffield from 46,000 in 1801 to 110,000 in 1844, and the consumption of
coal in the latter city alone reached in 1836, 515,000 tons. In 1805 there were
exported 4,300 tons of iron products and 4,600 tons of pig-iron; in 1834,
16,200 tons of iron products and 107,000 tons of pig-iron, while the whole iron
product, reaching in 1740 but 17,000 tons, had risen in 1834 to nearly 700,000
tons. The smelting of pig-iron alone consumes yearly more than 5,000,000 tons
of coal, and the importance which coal-mining has attained in the course of the
last 60 years can scarcely be conceived. All the English and Scotch deposits
are now worked, and the mines of Northumberland and Durham alone yield annually
more than 5,000,000 tons for shipping, and employ from 40 to 50,000 men.
According to the <i>Durham Chronicle, </i>there were worked in these two
counties: </p>
<p class="indentb">In 1755, 14 mines; in 1800, 40 mines; in 1836, 76 mines; in
1843, 130 mines.</p>
<p>Moreover, all mines are now much more energetically worked than formerly. A
similarly increased activity was applied to the working of tin, copper, and
lead, and alongside of the extension of glass manufacture arose a new branch of
industry in the production of pottery, rendered important by the efforts of
Josiah Wedgwood, about 1765. This inventor placed the whole manufacture of
stoneware on a scientific basis, introduced better taste, and founded the
potteries of North Staffordshire, a district of eight English miles square,
which, formerly a desert waste, is now sown with works and dwellings, and
supports more than 60,000 people. </p>
<p>Into this universal whirl of activity everything was drawn. Agriculture made
a corresponding advance. Not only did landed property pass, as we have already
seen, into the hands of new owners and cultivators, agriculture was affected in
still another way. The great holders applied capital to the improvement of the
soil, tore down needless fences, drained, manured, employed better tools, and
applied a rotation of crops. The progress of science came to their assistance
also; Sir Humphry Davy applied chemistry to agriculture with success, and the
development of mechanical science bestowed a multitude of advantages upon the
large farmer. Further, in consequence of the increase of population, the demand
for agricultural products increased in such measure that from 1760 to 1834,
6,840,540 acres of waste land were reclaimed; and, in spite of this, England
was transformed from a grain exporting to a grain importing country. </p>
<p>The same activity was developed in the establishment of communication. From
1818 to 1829, there were built in England and Wales, 1,000 English miles of
roadway of the width prescribed by law, 60 feet, and nearly all the old roads
were reconstructed on the new system of McAdam. In Scotland, the Department of
Public Works built since 1805 nearly 900 miles of roadway and more than 1,000
bridges, by which the population of the Highlands was suddenly placed within
reach of civilisation. The Highlanders had hitherto been chiefly poachers and
smugglers; they now became farmers and hand-workers. And, though Gaelic schools
were organised for the purpose of maintaining the Gaelic language, yet
Gaelic-Celtic customs and speech are rapidly vanishing before the approach of
English civilisation. So, too, in Ireland; between the counties of Cork,
Limerick, and Kerry, lay hitherto a wilderness wholly without passable roads,
and serving, by reason of its inaccessibility, as the refuge of all criminals
and the chief protection of the Celtic Irish nationality in the South of
Ireland. It has now been cut through by public roads, and civilisation has thus
gained admission even to this savage region. The whole British Empire, and
especially England, which, sixty years ago, had as bad roads as Germany or
France then had, is now covered by a network of the finest roadways; and these,
too, like almost everything else in England, are the work of private
enterprise, the State having done very little in this direction. </p>
<p>Before 1755 England possessed almost no canals. In that year a canal was
built in Lancashire from Sankey Brook to St. Helen's; and in 1759, James
Brindley built the first important one, the Duke of Bridgewater's Canal from
Manchester and the coal-mines of the district to the mouth of the Mersey
passing, near Barton, by aqueduct, over the river Irwell. From this achievement
dates the canal building of England, to which Brindley first gave importance.
Canals were now built, and rivers made navigable in all directions. In England
alone, there are 2,200 miles of canals and 1,800 miles of navigable river. In
Scotland, the Caledonian Canal was cut directly across the country, and in
Ireland several canals were built. These improvements, too, like the railroads
and roadways, are nearly all the work of private individuals and companies. </p>
<p>The railroads have been only recently built. The first great one was opened
from Liverpool to Manchester in 1830, since which all the great cities have
been connected by rail. London with Southampton, Brighton, Dover, Colchester,
Exeter, and Birmingham; Birmingham with Gloucester, Liverpool, Lancaster (via
Newton and Wigan, and via Manchester and Bolton); also with Leeds (via
Manchester and Halifax, and via Leicester, Derby, and Sheffield); Leeds with
Hull and Newcastle (via York). There are also many minor lines building or
projected, which will soon make it possible to travel from Edinburgh to London
in one day. </p>
<p>As it had transformed the means of communication by land, so did the
introduction of steam revolutionise travel by sea. The first steamboat was
launched in 1807, in the Hudson, in North America; the first in the British
Empire, in 1811, on the Clyde. Since then, more than 600 have been built in
England; and in 1836 more than 500 were plying to and from British ports. </p>
<p>Such, in brief, is the history of English industrial development in the past
sixty years, a history which has no counterpart in the annals of humanity.
Sixty, eighty years ago, England was a country like every other, with small
towns, few and simple industries, and a thin but <i>proportionally </i>large
agricultural population. Today it is a country like <i>no </i>other, with a
capital of two and a half million inhabitants; with vast manufacturing cities;
with an industry that supplies the world, and produces almost everything by
means of the most complex machinery; with an industrious, intelligent, dense
population, of which two-thirds are employed in trade and commerce, and
composed of classes wholly different; forming, in fact, with other customs and
other needs, a different nation from the England of those days. The industrial
revolution is of the same importance for England as the political revolution
for France, and the philosophical revolution for Germany; and the difference
between England in 1760 and in 1844 is at least as great as that between France
under the <i>ancien régime </i>and during the revolution of July. But the
mightiest result of this industrial transformation is the English proletariat.
</p>
<p>We have already seen how the proletariat was called into existence by the
introduction of machinery. The rapid extension of manufacture demanded hands,
wages rose, and troops of workmen migrated from the agricultural districts to
the towns. Population multiplied enormously, and nearly all the increase took
place in the proletariat. Further, Ireland had entered upon an orderly
development only since the beginning of the eighteenth century. There, too, the
population, more than decimated by English cruelty in earlier disturbances, now
rapidly multiplied, especially after the advance in manufacture began to draw
masses of Irishmen towards England. Thus arose the great manufacturing and
commercial cities of the British Empire, in which at least three-fourths of the
population belong to the working-class, while the lower middle-class consists
only of small shop-keepers, and very very few handicraftsmen. For, though the
rising manufacture first attained importance by transforming tools into
machines, work-rooms into factories, and consequently, the toiling lower
middle-class into the toiling proletariat, and the former large merchants into
manufacturers, though the lower middle-class was thus early crushed out, and
the population reduced to the two opposing elements, workers and capitalists,
this happened outside of the domain of manufacture proper, in the province of
handicraft and retail trade as well. In the place of the former masters and
apprentices, came great capitalists and working-men who had no prospect of
rising above their class. Hand-work was carried on after the fashion of factory
work, the division of labour was strictly applied, and small employers who
could not compete with great establishments were forced down into the
proletariat. At the same time the destruction of the former organisation of
hand-work, and the disappearance of the lower middle-class deprived the
workingman of all possibility of rising into the middle-class himself. Hitherto
he had always had the prospect of establishing himself somewhere as master
artificer, perhaps employing journeymen and apprentices; but now, when master
artificers were crowded out by manufacturers, when large capital had become
necessary for carrying on work independently, the working-class became, for the
first time, an integral, permanent class of the population, whereas it had
formerly often been merely a transition leading to the bourgeoisie. Now, he who
was born to toil had no other prospect than that of remaining a toiler all his
life. Now, for the first time, therefore, the proletariat was in a position to
undertake an independent movement. </p>
<p>In this way were brought together those vast masses of working-men who now
fill the whole British Empire, whose social condition forces itself every day
more and more upon the attention of the civilised world. </p>
<p>The condition of the working-class is the condition of the vast majority of
the English people. The question: What is to become of those destitute
millions, who consume today what they earned yesterday; who have created the
greatness of England by their inventions and their toil; who become with every
passing day more conscious of their might, and demand, with daily increasing
urgency, their share of the advantages of society? -- This, since the Reform
Bill, has become the national question. All Parliamentary debates, of any
importance, may be reduced to this; and, though the English middle-class will
not as yet admit it, though they try to evade this great question, and to
represent their own particular interests as the truly national ones, their
action is utterly useless. With every session of Parliament the working-class
gains ground, the interests of the middle-class diminish in importance; and, in
spite of the fact that the middle-class is the chief, in fact, the only power
in Parliament, the last session of 1844 was a continuous debate upon subjects
affecting the working-class, the Poor Relief Bill, the Factory Act, the
Masters' and Servants' Act', and Thomas Duncombe, the representative of the
working-men in the House of Commons, was the great man of the session; while
the Liberal middle-class with its motion for repealing the Corn Laws, and the
Radical middle-class with its resolution for refusing the taxes, played
pitiable roles. Even the debates about Ireland were at bottom debates about the
Irish proletariat, and the means of coming to its assistance. It is high time,
too, for the English middle-class to make some concessions to the working-men
who no longer plead but threaten, for in a short time it may be too late. </p>
<p>In spite of all this, the English middle-class, especially the manufacturing
class, which is enriched directly by means of the poverty of the workers,
persists in ignoring this poverty. This class, feeling itself the mighty
representative class of the nation, is ashamed to lay the sore spot of England
bare before the eyes of the world; will not confess, even to itself, that the
workers are in distress, because it, the property-holding, manufacturing class,
must bear the moral responsibility for this distress. Hence the scornful smile
which intelligent Englishmen (and they, the middle-class, alone are known on
the Continent) assume when any one begins to speak of the condition of the
working-class; hence the utter ignorance on the part of the whole middle-class
of everything which concerns the workers; hence the ridiculous blunders which
men of this class, in and out of Parliament, make when the position of the
proletariat comes under discussion; hence the absurd freedom from anxiety, with
which the middle-class dwells upon a soil that is honeycombed, and may any day
collapse, the speedy collapse of which is as certain as a mathematical or
mechanical demonstration; hence the miracle that the English have as yet no
single book upon the condition of their workers, although they have been
examining and mending the old state of things no one knows how many years.
Hence also the deep wrath of the whole working-class, from Glasgow to London,
against the rich, by whom they are systematically plundered and mercilessly
left to their fate, a wrath which before too long a time goes by, a time almost
within the power of man to predict, must break out into a revolution in
comparison with which the French Revolution, and the year 1794, will prove to
have been child's play.</p>

<h4>[London,] 5 January 1866</h4>
<p><strong>Dear Fred</strong>,</p>
<p><i>In the greatest of haste.</i></p>
<p>Best thanks for the £10.</p>
<p>The bill of exchange falls due on 18 February, and is for £48. I wanted the <strong>landlord</strong> to draw it only for the 2 terms that were due and not for the third one as well, which is not due until the end of January. But he insisted.</p>
<p>A plot has been hatched against the <strong>International Association</strong> in which connection I need your co-operation. Further details later. For the moment, suffice to say: Mr Le Lubez and Vesinier (the latter well aware that an <strong>Inquiry</strong> into his past is in progress; he is in Brussels again) have a French branch here (<strong>in fact</strong> an opposition branch); Longuet, the editor of <i>Rive gauche, </i>also belongs to it, and it is tied up with all that pack of Proudhonists in Brussels. Vesinier began by publishing a long screed against us in the <i>Echo de Verviers, </i><strong>of course</strong> <strong>anonymously</strong>. Then, in the <i>same </i>paper which is putting out the <strong>slanders</strong> against our Association (among other things, falsely calls Tolain and Fribourg Bonapartists, too), the London <strong>Branch</strong> published a programme, a draft of future statutes, which <i>they, </i>the Faithful, are going to put to the Congress.</p>
<p>The real crux of the controversy is the <i>Polish question. </i>The fellows have all attached themselves to the Muscovitist line pursued by Proudhon and Herzen. I shall therefore send you the earlier articles by the oracles in the <i>Tribune du Peuple </i>against Poland and you must do a refutation, either for our papers in Geneva (the ‘German’ one) or for <i>The Workman’s Advocate. </i>The Russian gentlemen have acquired some bran-new allies in the Proudhonised section of ‘Jeune France’.</p>

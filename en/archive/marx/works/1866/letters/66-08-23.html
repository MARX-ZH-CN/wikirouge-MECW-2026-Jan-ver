<h4>London, 23 August 1866</h4>
<p>My dear Friend,</p>
<p>You must justifiably be angered by my prolonged silence, despite your sundry friendly communications.</p>
<p>However, you will have to excuse me, on account of the extraordinary circumstances in which I find myself.</p>
<p>In consequence of my long illness, my economic situation has reached a point of crisis. I have accumulated debts, which are a crushing mental burden and make me incapable of any activity other than the work in which I am immersed. If I do not succeed in taking out a loan of at least 1,000 talers at an interest of say 5%, I can really see no way out. And despite the numerous letters of acknowledgment I receive from Germany, I do not know where to turn. I can only accept aid from personal friends, nothing public. You will understand that in such conditions letter-writing becomes difficult.</p>
<p>I have not yet succeeded in re-establishing my former lucrative links with America. They are so taken up with their own movement there that they regard any expenditure on European reports as <i>faux frais de production</i>.  I could help them by emigrating myself. But I consider it my duty to remain in Europe and complete the work on which I have been engaged for so many years <span class="context">[Capital]</span>.</p>
<p>As regards that work itself, I do not think I shall be able to deliver the manuscript of the first volume (it has now grown to 3 volumes) to Hamburg before October. I can only work productively for a very few hours per day without immediately feeling the effects physically, and for my family’s sake I suppose I must, however unwillingly, resolve to observe the hygienic limits until I am fully recovered. My work is furthermore often interrupted by the impingement of adverse external circumstances.</p>
<p>Although I am devoting much time to the preparations for the congress in Geneva, I cannot go myself, nor do I wish to, because my work cannot be subjected to prolonged interruption. I consider that what I am doing through this work is far more important for the working class than anything I might be able to do personally at any <i>congrès quelconque</i> <span class="context">[congress whatsoever]</span>.</p>
<p>I regard the international situation in Europe as only temporary. As regards Germany in particular, we must take things as we find them,  i.e., promote the interests of revolution in a manner appropriate to the changed conditions. <strong>As to Prussia</strong>, it is now more important than ever <strong>to watch and to denounce</strong> her <strong>relations to Russia</strong>.</p>
<p class="sig">Your very sincere friend<br>
K. Marx</p>

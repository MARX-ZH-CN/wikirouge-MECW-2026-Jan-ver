<h4>[London,] 15 January 1866</h4>
<p>Dear <strong>Library</strong>,</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>You must excuse my silence, ditto the brevity of these lines of mine. You will not believe <strong>how bothered</strong> I am for time. <i>Indisposition</i>, forever recurring periodically, all manner of unfortunate <i>mischances demands made on me</i> by the <strong>International Association</strong>, etc., have confiscated every free moment I have for writing out the fair copy of my manuscript. <span class="context">[<i>Capital</i>]</span> I hope to be able to take Volume I of it to the publisher for printing myself in March. (The whole thing, the two volumes, will, however, appear <i>simultaneously </i>This<i> is good</i>.)</p>
<p>So, this very much by way of summary.</p>
<p>Today I am sending you by post the 2 latest issues of <i>The Workman’s Advocate, </i>of which Eccarius is now editor. If, as I hope, you send any <i>articles </i>for it, please do so to me (political, social, as you will).</p>
<p>I also enclose <strong>cards of membership</strong><i> </i>for you. I have paid for them. You can therefore give them to whomever you like, and have only to inscribe the name and after the £, put 0, but after the Os., 1d.</p>
<p>The conditions, <strong>generally</strong>, are these: <i>a society as such </i>that wishes to join has an <i>Association collective membership Card</i>, for which 5s. per year is to be paid. But, if all the members join individually, they have to take out cards of the kind I am sending you. This is advantageous for workers. The cards serve as a passport abroad, and their <i>confréres</i> in London, Paris, Brussels, Lyons, Geneva, etc., will get jobs for them.</p>
<p>The Association has made great progress. It already has 1 official English paper, <i>The Workman’s Advocate, </i>a Brussels one, <i>La Tribune du Peuple, </i>a French one in Geneva, <i>Journal de 1'Association Internationale des Travailleurs, Section de la Suisse Romande</i>, and a German one in Geneva, <i>Der Vorbote, </i>which will be appearing in a few days. <i>Address: 6 rue du Môle, Genf, J. P. Becker, </i>in case you want to write to the old man occasionally (as I hope you will).</p>
<p>I am now hoping you will soon make it possible for me to announce the foundation of a Leipzig section and enable me to present correspondence. (<i>In English. </i>It can then be used in <i>The Workman’s Advocate </i>as well.) The number is not important, although <strong>the more, the better</strong>.</p>
<p>If people want to join <i>en masse, </i>as a society, you will see that the <i>total price </i>of 5s., which they have to pay annually, is <i>nothing</i>. </p>
<p>J. P. Becker writes to me:</p>
<p class="quoteb">‘Sections are going to be formed in Leipzig, Gotha, Stuttgart and Nuremberg; shall we register them here for the time being, until there is a large number and a Central Committee has been formed in Germany?’</p>
<p>I have replied <i>in the affirmative</i>. However, since there can be several branches in one town, you and your people can establish links direct with us.</p>
<p>I have had a second letter from the Berliners. I am at last writing to them today. Ditto to Dr Kugelmann.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i>.</p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. M.</p>
<p>I will let you know next time what questions are to be dealt with at the Geneva Congress at the end of May.</p>

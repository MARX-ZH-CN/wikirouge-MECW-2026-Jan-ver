<h4>[London,] 28 August 1866</h4>
<p>My dear Cacadou,</p>
<p>I have received your letter, but not unopened, since it had to pass through the fingered hands of the Emperor <span class="context">[Jennychen]</span>.</p>
<p>It was always my opinion that to give the last finishing stroke to your ‘heducation’ some sort of boarding school training was still wanted. It will do you a great deal of good.</p>
<p><i>II hidalgo della figure trista</i> <span class="context">[the knight of the woeful character — Don Quixote, i.e., Paul Lafargue]</span> left me at the corner of his house. His heart having been considerably shaken before, he seemed to bear his separation from me with a rather heroic indifference.</p>
<p>My best wishes to <span class="context">[Marx uses three mathematical symbols for ‘Eleanor’]</span>: +/-∞-/+</p>
<p>I enclose 5 l., the remainder to be sent in the second week.</p>
<p class="sig">Yours humbly<br>
Old One</p>

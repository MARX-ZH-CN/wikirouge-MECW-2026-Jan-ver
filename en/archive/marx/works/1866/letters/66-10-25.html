<p class="fst">Dear Friend</p>
<p>A few lines at once.</p>
<p class="fst">1. To thank you for your efforts.</p>
<p class="fst">2. To tell you that I received this, as well as the previous letters.</p>
<p class="fst">3. You mistake my relations with Engels. He is my most intimate friend. I have <i>no secrets </i>from him. Had it not been for him I should long ago have been compelled to take up ‘business’. Therefore in no circumstances do I want any third person to intervene with him on my account. He also, obviously, can only act within certain limits.</p>
<p>Dr Jakobi, <sup class="enote"><a href="#n1">[1]</a></sup> I have been informed by workers, has become a very good citizen and consequently is not to be troubled in any way with my private affairs.</p>
<p>I must see about doing something, but I see that you have tried to do everything in your power, and therefore ask you to consider this affair settled.</p>
<p>I do <i>not </i>write for the <i>Commonwealth</i>.</p>
<p class="sig">Yours<br>
<b>KM</b></p>
<p>Miquel <sup class="enote"><a href="#n2">[2]</a></sup> and Co can wait a long time before they become Prussian ministers.</p>

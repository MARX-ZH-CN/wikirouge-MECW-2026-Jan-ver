I have found little new in the Ténot (Paris) except a few details — I have not yet read the <i>Provinces</i>.  The enormous sensation  the  book  has  made  in  Paris and in  France generally proves a very interesting fact, namely that the generation which has grown up under Badinguet knows absolutely
nothing of the history of the regime under which it is living. Now the fellows are rubbing their eyes and seem as if they had just dropped from the clouds.  If one may compare small things with great, have not we had just the same experience in our way? In Germany it is now spreading as a wonderful novelty that <a href="../../../../../glossary/people/l/a.html#lassalle" target=_blank>Lassalle</a> was only one of our satellites and did not discover the "class war."

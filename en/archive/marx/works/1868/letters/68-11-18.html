<h4>Manchester, 18 November 1868</h4>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>What do you say about the elections in the factory districts? The proletariat has once again made an awful fool of itself. Manchester and Salford return 3 Tories against 2 Liberals, including the <strong>milk-and-water</strong> Bazley, Bolton, Preston, Blackburn, etc., almost all Tories. In Ashton it looks as if Milner Gibson has gone <strong>to the wall</strong>. Ernest Jones <strong>nowhere</strong>, despite the <strong>cheering</strong>. Everywhere the proletariat are the <strong>rag, tag and bobtail</strong> of the official parties, and if any party has gained strength from the new <strong>voters</strong>, it is the Tories. The small towns, the <strong>half rotten boroughs</strong> are the salvation of bourgeois Liberalism, and roles will be reversed: the Tories will favour more members for the big towns and the Liberals will favour unequal representation.</p>
<p>Here the electors have increased from 24,000 to not quite 48,000, and the Tories have increased their <strong>voters</strong> from 6,000 to 14-15,000. The Liberals have let slip a lot, and M. Henry did a lot of harm, but it cannot be denied that the increase in working-class <strong>votes</strong> has brought the Tories more than their simple percentage, and has improved their relative position. On the whole this is a good thing. As things look now, Gladstone should have a narrow majority and will be compelled to change the Reform Bill to stop the rolling stone; with a large majority, he would have let things take their course, as usual.</p>
<p>But it remains an appalling display of weakness by the English proletariat. <i>The parson</i> has shown unexpected power, and also the cringing before <strong>respectability</strong>. Not a single working-class candidate had <strong>a ghost of a chance</strong>, but <strong>mylord Tom Noddy</strong> or any parvenu snob could have the workers’ votes with pleasure.</p>
<p>The howls of the Liberal bourgeois would amuse me very much were it not for this accompanying experience. To cheer myself up properly, yesterday I made Borchardt’s son-in-law, who had dutifully drudged for the Liberals, as drunk as a lord.</p>

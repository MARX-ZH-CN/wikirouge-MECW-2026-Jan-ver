<h4>London, 12 September 1868</h4>
<p><strong>Dear Fred</strong>,</p>
<p>Luckily the congress ends today and up to Thursday — that is as far as the news goes — it had only compromised itself tolerably. But one must always fear some public disgrace, since the Belgians form the enormous majority. Mr Tolain and other Parisians want to have the <strong>General Council</strong> moved to Brussels. They are very <strong>jealous of</strong> London. It is a great step forward that the Proudhonist ‘<i>braves Belges’ </i>and French, who dogmatically declaimed against <strong>trades unions</strong>, etc., in Geneva (<i>1866</i>)<i> </i>and Lausanne (<i>1867</i>), are now most fanatically in favour. In spite of all their boasting, the ‘<i>braves Belges’ </i>had made no preparations. For example, the correspondent of <i>The Daily News </i>hunted in vain for 3 days for the possible meeting place until he accidentally ran into Jung and Stepney. In fact, the premises had not been booked in advance, and the ‘<i>braves Belges’ </i>wanted to charge the expenses (among others, those for their 250 participants) to the London <strong>General Council</strong>, to which they and the French owe about 3,000 frs. The sum is now being raised by private collections among the delegates.</p>
<p>I am in a bad scrape. Laura has fallen sick since you were here, and my wife was forced to borrow £10 from her simply to meet the extra expenses, as we are absolutely broke.</p>
<p>I have heard nothing at all from Holland and must therefore regard the silence as intentional. I really do not know what to do.</p>
<p>Apropos. It was a good thing that we changed the word <strong>convicts</strong> into <strong>victims</strong>. </p>
<p>On the return of Shaw — who was sent at Moore’s expense — the latter will receive his <strong>receipt</strong><i>.</i></p>
<p><i> Salut</i>.</p>

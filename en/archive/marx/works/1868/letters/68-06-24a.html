<p class="fst">Dear Friend</p>
<p>I was prevented by all sorts of incidents from writing to you. Even now only a few lines.</p>
<p>My eldest and youngest daughters have both got scarlatina. I remember that in Hanover you spoke to me of the treatment required once the crisis was passed and the scaling-off process begins. Will you be so kind as to write me about it at once.</p>
<p>With best greetings to your dear wife and Fränzchen.</p>
<p class="sig">Yours<br>
K Marx</p>
<p>Liebknecht is growing more and more imbecile in his South-German stupidity. He is not enough of a dialectician to criticise both sides at the same time.</p>

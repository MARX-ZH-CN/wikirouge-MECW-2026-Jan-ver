<h4>Manchester, 8 October 1868</h4>
<p>Dear Moor,</p>
<p>I have been terribly plagued with <strong>commerce</strong> these days, so I can only return the letters today. </p>
<p>Schweitzer is a special case. The fellow is more cunning and more active than all his opponents together, although this time he has certainly been <i>too </i>cunning — according to the <i>Kölnische Zeitung </i>the real workers’ assemblies which are now appearing are everywhere repudiating the presidents imposed upon them by the ‘Congress’, and these <strong>self-elected</strong> fellows, up to and including Schweitzer, will realise that, as soon as there is real <strong>business</strong>, these tricks and attempts to impose their sect upon the real movement as a leadership are no longer effective.</p>
<p>As Secretary for Germany you will of course have to correspond with the <strong>unions</strong> that might be formed, as long as counter-<strong>unions</strong> are not formed within the individual trades, when a choice would have to be made between the two — or could they both affiliate? In this respect, you will have English <strong>precedents</strong>. Of importance is only the point that Schweitzer and his people should always be reminded that they are corresponding with the <i>Secretary for Germany, </i>not with <i>Karl Marx, </i>and you will see to this.</p>
<p>The Russian translation <span class="context">[of Volume I of Capital]</span> is very gratifying; as soon as the matter has gone a little further, this should be got into the press.</p>
<p>I have not yet been able to look at the manuscript by Dietzgen.</p>
<p>Gaudissart becomes increasingly amusing. The 30 printed sheets are not dangerous for the time being; since they are supposed to appear simultaneously in 4 languages it will probably still take an eternity. As a Jew he simply cannot stop cheating, and it serves him right that he has burnt his fingers on Biscamp.</p>
<p>Wilhelmchen is not bad either. Regarding the Swabians, it thus appears to be <i>money </i>matters that bind him and his people to the federalists. This should be investigated more closely, afterwards all this will fall on our shoulders. I had drawn his attention to the fact that at a moment when revolutionary action came nearer, it was absolutely <i>against </i>the interests of our Party that our people should be too closely committed to one party in the basically rotten antagonism between Greater Prussia and Austrian-Federalist Greater Germany. The unfortunate fool still cannot see that the entire antithesis with its two sides is a case of narrow-mindedness pure and simple. I thought the Spanish revolution  would have made him see some light, but <strong>no go</strong>.</p>
<p>I have seen no details yet about the course of the Schweitzer congress and its effects, since I only receive the <i>Zukunft </i>late.</p>
<p>Best greetings.</p>

<h4>London, 15 December 1868 Evening, after midnight</h4>
<p><strong>Dear Fred</strong>,</p>
<p>Would you please study the enclosed document... <i>seriously, </i>despite its <i>fadaise</i>.<i> </i><span class="context">[absurdity]</span><i> Your marginal notes </i>should be written for me in <i>French, </i>and the stuff itself <i>returned to me at the latest by </i><strong>Saturday next</strong>.</p>
<p><i>Mr Bakunin — </i>in the background of this business — is condescending enough to wish to take the workers’ movement under <i>Russian </i>leadership.</p>
<p>This shit has been in existence for 2 months. Only this evening did <strong>Old</strong> Becker inform the General Council about it in writing. This time Nincompoop is right. As <strong>Old</strong> Becker writes, this association should make up for the deficient ‘<i>idealism</i>’ of our Association. <i>L'idéalisme Russe!</i></p>
<p>There was great anger about the document this evening at the meeting of our <i>Conseil Général, </i>particularly among the French. I had known about the shit for a long time. I regarded it as stillborn, and out of consideration for <strong>Old</strong> Becker, wanted to let it die a quiet death.</p>
<p>But the business has become more serious than I expected. And consideration for <strong>Old</strong> Becker is no longer admissible. This evening the <strong>Council</strong> decided to repudiate this <strong>interloping society</strong> publicly — in Paris, New York, Germany and Switzerland. I have been commissioned with drafting the decree of repudiation (for next Tuesday). I regret the whole thing, because of <strong>Old</strong> Becker. Mais our Association cannot commit <strong>suicide</strong> because of <strong>Old</strong> Becker.</p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. M.</p>
<p>Strohn writes to me from Düsseldorf that his brother Eugen has died suddenly in Hamburg.</p>
<p>About the <strong>cotton bankruptcies</strong> in Manchester, etc., can you send me <i>The Guardian?</i></p>

<p class="fst">My dear Friend</p>
<p>Since at this moment, when your letter arrives, I am plagued with a visit, I shall write just these few lines.</p>
<p>Kertbeny’s <sup class="enote"><a href="#n1">[1]</a></sup> address: No I/III (what the III means I do not know; perhaps, third floor) Behrenstrasse.</p>
<p>Now permit me a word. Since you and Engels were of the opinion that it would be useful, I gave way to having this advertisement in the <i>Gartenlaube</i>. I was <i>decisively opposed to it</i>. And now I ask you <i>urgently</i>, <i>to give up </i>this joke <i>definitely</i>. It leads to nothing except that fellows like Keil and ‘Daheim’ believe that one belongs to the pack of great literary and other men, and needs or desires their protection.</p>
<p>I think it is more harmful than useful and beneath the dignity of a scientific man. For example, Meyer’s <i>Konversationslexikon </i>wrote asking me for a biography a long time ago. Not only did I not send one, but I did not even answer their letter. Everybody must reach salvation in his own way. As for Kertbeny, he is a confused, boastful, importunate literary idler and the less one has to do with him, the better.</p>
<p class="indentb">Salut<br>
Yours<br>

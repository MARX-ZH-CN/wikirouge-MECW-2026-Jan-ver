<h4>London, 19 December 1868</h4>
<p><strong>Dear Fred</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>Thanks</strong> for your marginal notes! When I wrote to you that evening I was excited. But the next morning there was already a reaction and the decision to treat the matter diplomatically, quite as you advise.</p>
<p>Ténot’s <i>Province </i>is much better. It contains many new details for us. Had the Parisians held out a couple of days longer, the <i>Empire </i>would have been <i>foutu</i>. <span class="context">[finished]</span> The movement (republican) among the rural population was much bigger than we knew.</p>
<p>Enclosed <i>Réveil, </i>the organ of Ledru-Rollin. Delescluze his <i>ame damnée, républicain de vieille roche, asinus. </i>He is the provisional government’s commissioner who led the Belgians into the <i>guet-àpens </i>of Risquons Tout. Thus traitor or arch-<strong>ass</strong>. Probably the latter.</p>
<p>The stupid idea of the workers who wanted to give a banquet for <span class="context">[U.S. Ambassador in London]</span> R. Johnson has been blocked <i>by us. </i>Coningsby, whose initiative it was, is a blackguard. This character was on a <strong>pleasure trip to the United States</strong> and was paid by Seward for this London reception for R. Johnson. He is the same <strong>workman</strong> who wrote to <i>The Times </i>years ago, stating that the workers were politically satisfied and <strong>did not want the suffrage</strong>.</p>
<p>If you could send me a few £ for the Christmas week now beginning, it would be very welcome. </p>
<p><i>Salut</i>.</p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>

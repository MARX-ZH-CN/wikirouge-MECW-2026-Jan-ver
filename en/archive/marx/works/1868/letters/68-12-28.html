<h4>[London,] 28 December 1868</h4>
<p>Dear Jung,</p>
<p>Scarcely had you gone when I received a letter from Bakunin assuring me of his special friendship.</p>
<p>From his letter I see that he has once again written at length to De Paepe, in order to lure him into the <i>Alliance Internationale. </i>To prevent later <strong>mischief</strong> or later complaints about the lack of timely information, you must <i>dispatch </i>to De Paepe as soon as possible a copy of our resolution on the Alliance. Of course, you must tell him, at the same time, that, because of the present state of affairs in Switzerland and in order to avoid any appearance of <strong>scission</strong>, we do <i>not </i>wish to have the resolution <i>published, </i>but are confining ourselves to communicating it confidentially to the respective central councils in the various countries.</p>
<p>Do not forget to invite <i>Applegarth </i>to the Saturday session in good time. It would probably be good to do the same with <i>Odger.</i></p>
<p class="sig">Yours<br>
K. M.</p>

<h4>London, 14 September 1868<br>
1 Modena Villas, Maitland Park, Haverstock Hill</h4>
<p>Dear Meyer,</p>
<p>Enclosed the issue of <i>The Times </i>containing the 4th <strong>Annual Report</strong> of the <strong>General Council</strong> (written by <i>me</i>)<i>, </i>and the very interesting <i>Times </i><strong>first leader</strong><i> </i>on this document. This is the first time that it has abandoned its tone of <i>moquerie </i>about the working class, and taken it ‘verry’ <i>au sérieux. </i>Spread this around. Inform Jessup of this.</p>
<p>I must reply to both your letters, the first to me and the 2nd to Eccarius, which was handed me in his absence (he has not yet returned from Brussels).</p>
<p>As far as the first letter is concerned, it is your fault if <i>Sorge </i>(who is <i>completely unknown </i>to me) has received credentials. If you wanted simply to give him a recommendation for a particular purpose, you should have written so clearly. The way you put it in your letter, I believed that Sorge was <i>your and A. Vogt’s man</i>. So be more careful in future. Then you made the second mistake of <i>giving </i>the credentials to Sorge, instead of writing to me first about the misunderstanding!</p>
<p>The mistake has been made, but it is not irreparable.</p>
<p>The Brussels Congress has once again allotted the General Council to London. But it is now to be regarded as a <i>new </i><strong>Council</strong>, which <i>revises </i>all <i>old </i>credentials. So write to me whether you and A. Vogt want credentials. Write, too, <i>in which manner </i>we should withdraw Sorge’s credentials or, alternatively, inform him that the new General Council has changed the credentials. </p>
<p>Drury was here for a while. Recently, shortly before the Brussels Congress, he was <i>proposed </i>as authorised agent of the <strong>International Workingmen’s Association</strong> to the <strong>American Labor Union</strong> and its congress. We <i>did not agree to this at the time, </i>since the source of the suggestion appeared suspicious to us. Please observe the man more closely first, either yourself or through friends.</p>
<p>No <strong>copies</strong> remain of the <i>Commonwealth </i><strong>paper</strong>. For the past few years there have <i>not </i>been any <i>agitational </i>writings in our sense in England. My <i>book has not yet been translated into English. </i>Eccarius, otherwise very capable, but at the same time very <strong>ambitious</strong>, has <i>intentionally not mentioned it </i>in <i>The Commonwealth </i>or at other opportunities. He likes to appropriate my propositions <i>for himself. </i>At the congress in Brussels, Lessner mentioned <i>my book </i>in his speech about machinery. The correspondent of <i>The Daily News </i>reported this. Eccarius, who reported the congress sessions for <i>The Times</i>, suppressed it. His conduct is all the more absurd since he owes me not only his knowledge, but also his post as general secretary on the <strong>General Council</strong>. I alone supported him (at <i>The Commonwealth </i>too) against attacks by the English and French. He relies upon the experience he already has with me, that I am only concerned with the cause, and ignore personal stupidities!</p>
<p>I shall <i>not </i>give him your letter.</p>
<p>The more English excerpts from my book you can get into the American press the better.</p>
<p>Send them to me!</p>
<p>I attach the enclosed card. It was sent to us, with a letter, to establish contact with us. Address: G. W. Randall, <strong>Secretary, Workingmen’s Institute</strong>, 3 Tremont Row, Room 52, <i>Boston </i>N. E.</p>
<p>I lost contact years ago with all my acquaintances in America. I am still in touch only with Meyer in St. Louis, the friend of our J. Weydemeyer (deceased last year).</p>
<p>Write me all you can find out about the relationship between the railways and real estate.</p>
<p>You may have seen that, at its congress in Hamburg, the General Association of German Workers passed a special resolution giving recognition to my book.</p>
<p>Write to Randall on my behalf as <strong>German Secretary </strong>of the<strong> General Council</strong>.</p>
<p>Best greetings to A. Vogt and yourself.</p>
<p class="sig">Yours<br>
K. Marx</p>
<p>I am sending 2 copies of <i>The Times, </i>one for you, the other for Jessup.</p>

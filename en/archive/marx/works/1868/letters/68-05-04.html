<h4>London, 4 May 1868</h4>
<p><strong>Dear Fred</strong>,</p>
<p>This morning I received enclosed letter and cutting from Schweitzer. Since he addresses himself to me as workers’ representative of one of the most industrial districts, I must naturally reply.</p>
<p>My view is that the Germans can stand a reduction of the protective tariff on pig iron and that the manufacturers of other articles are also exaggerating their howls. This view is based upon a comparison of the English and German exports to neutral markets. Enclosed, by way of example, a note on exports to Belgium.</p>
<p>At the same time, in my opinion, the point is to exploit this question in the interests of the party, without, however, procuring any new reliefs to the English.</p>
<p>My proposal would therefore be:</p>
<p class="fst">1.<i> No reduction of tariffs </i>before a parliamentary <i>enquête </i>into the state of the German iron-mining production and iron manufacture. This <i>enquête </i>should not, however, be confined, as the bourgeois gentlemen desire, simply to chambers of commerce and experts but should, at the same time, include the <i>workers’ conditions </i>in these branches; all the more so since Messrs manufacturers are ‘demanding’ the protective tariffs solely ‘for the protection’ of the workers, and have in addition discovered that ‘<i>the value of iron</i>’ consists only ‘of <i>wages </i>and freight’.</p>
<p class="fst">2.<i> No reduction of tariffs </i>before an <i>enquête </i>into how the <i>railways </i>misuse their monopoly, and before their freight (and passenger) tariffs are controlled by legal regulations.</p>
<p>I would like your view <i>immediately, </i>and also immediate return of the enclosures.</p>
<p>Very nice that your home-town chamber of commerce should bemoan the growing power and menace of the International Working Men’s Association.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. M.</p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term"><a id="*502"></a>*</span> The dissolution of the still earlier forms of communal property and real community goes without saying.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term"><a id="*503"></a>**</span> For in that case the capital presupposed as condition of wage labour is wage labours own product, and is presupposed by it as its own presupposition, created by it as its own presupposition.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term"><a id="*504"></a>***</span> Once capital and wage labour are posited as their own presupposition, as the basis presupposed to production itself, then what appears initially is that the capitalist possesses, in addition to the fund of raw materials and necessaries required for the labourer to reproduce himself, to create the required means of subsistence, i.e. to realize <i>necessary labour, </i>a fund of raw material and means of labour in which the worker realizes his surplus labour, i.e. the capitalists profit. On further analysis this takes the form that the worker constantly creates a double fund for the capitalist, or in the form of capital. One part of this fund constantly fulfills the conditions of his own existence and the other part fulfills the conditions for the existence of capital. As we have seen, in the case of the surplus capital -- and surplus capital in relation to its antediluvian relation to labour -- all <i>real, present capital </i>and each of its elements has equally been <i>appropriated </i>without exchange, without an equivalent, as objectified, appropriated <i>alien labour.</i></p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term"><a id="*506"></a>****</span> The first glance shows what a nonsensical circle it would be if on the one hand the <i>workers </i>whom capital has to put to work in order to posit itself as capital had first to be <i>created, </i>to be brought to life through its <i>stockpiling </i>if they waited for its command, <i>Let There Be Workers!; </i>while at the same time it were itself incapable of <i>stockpiling </i>without alien labour, could at most stockpile <i>its own labor, </i>i.c. could itself exist in the form of <i>not-capital </i>and <i>not-money; </i>since labour, before the existence of capital, can only realize itself in forms such as craft labour, petty agriculture etc., in short, all forms which can <i>not stockpile, </i>or only sparingly; in forms which allow of only a small surplus product and <i>eat up </i>most of it. We shall have to examine this notion of <i>stockpiling</i> [<i>Aufhäufung</i>] still more closely later on.</p>

G. A. L. Henschel, Paris, 1842, Vol. 2, p. 139, article entitled '2. Capitale'. However, Du Cange was wrong. The word <font face="Symbol">arceia</font>means 'government buildings', never 'loan' or 'principal sum of money owed' as suggested there; the Greek word for loan, which Du Cange probably had in mind, is <font face="Symbol">cpeox</font>.]</p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term"><a id="20"></a>20.</span> In English in the original.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term"><a id="21"></a>21.</span> Marx's distinction between <i>Rohstoff </i>and <i>Rohmaterial </i>has no English equivalent. <i>Rohstoff </i>the raw material in its pristine state, before being subjected to human labour; <i>Rohmaterial </i>is the raw material which has been formed by human labour but has yet to enter into the final product. Cf. <i>Capital, </i>Vol. I, Moscow, 1954, pp. 178-82.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term"><a id="24"></a>24.</span> <i>par excellence.</i></p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term"><a id="528*"></a>**</span> It is here presupposed of course that it follows a correct instinct. It could eat up the seed grain, let the field lie fallow, and build roads. But it would thereby not have accomplished the <i>necessary labour, </i>because it would not <i>reproduce </i> itself, not maintain itself as living labour capacity through this labour. Alternatively the living labour capacities may be directly murdered, as e.g. by Peter I, to build Petersburg. This sort of thing does not belong here.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term"><a id="529*"></a>*</span> That capital has to do not with isolated, individual labour but with combined labour, just as it is in and for itself already a social, combined force, is a point which should perhaps be treated already in the general history of the rise of capital.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term"><a id="529**"></a>**</span> The greater the extent to which production still rests on mere manual labour, on use of muscle power etc., in short on physical exertion by individual labourers, the more does the increase of the <i>productive force </i>consist in their collaboration <i>on a mass scale. </i>The opposite features, particularization and individualization, are displayed by the semi-artistic crafts; the skillfulness of individual, but uncombined labour. Capital, in its true development, combines mass labour with skill, but in such a way that the former loses its physical power, and the skill resides not in the worker but in the machine and in the scientific combination of both as a whole in the factory. The social spirit of labour obtains an objective existence separate from the individual workers.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term"><a id="529***"></a>***</span> <i>Among the Romans, the army constituted a mass -- </i>but already divorced from the whole people -- which was disciplined to labour, whose surplus time also belonged to the state; who sold their entire labour time for pay to the state, exchanged their entire labour capacity for a wage necessary for the maintenance of their life, just as does the worker with the capitalist. This holds for the period when the Roman army was no longer a citizens army but a mercenary army. This is here likewise a free sale of labour on the part of the soldier. But the state does not buy it with the production of values as aim. And thus, although the wage form may seem to occur originally in armies, this pay system is nevertheless essentially different from wage labour. There is some similarity in the fact that the state uses up the army in order to gain an increase in power and wealth.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term"><a id="529****"></a>****</span> If the state lets this sort of matter be conducted through <i>state-contractors,</i> then this still always takes place indirectly through the <i>corvée </i>or taxes.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term"><a id="530*"></a>*</span> <i>Competition </i>is better suited to create the necessity of e.g. the railway in a country where the previous development of its forces of production would not yet push so far. The effect of <i>competition among nations </i>belongs in the section on <i>international intercourse. </i>The civilizing influences of capital particularly show themselves here.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term"><a id="25"></a>25.</span> Cf. Hegel, <i>System of Philosophy, </i>I, <i>Logic, </i>para. 161: 'The concept remains at home with itself in its process; no new content is posited by the process, only an alteration of form is produced.'</p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term"><a id="31"></a>31.</span> William Thompson (1783-1833) was an Irish landowner who embraced Owenism, and criticized political economy from a utopian socialist position, but on the basis of Ricardo's doctrines.</p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term"><a id="549*"></a>**</span> Except if one imagines that all capitals produce to order for each other, and that the product is therefore always immediately money, a notion which contradicts the nature of capital and hence also the practice of large-scale industry.</p>

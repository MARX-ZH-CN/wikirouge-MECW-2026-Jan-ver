<h4>[London,] 13 November 1857</h4>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>A week ago on Thursday I waited at both the appointed places — which, however, was one too many — from 11 o'clock to 3. Then I gave the whole thing up <strong>in despair.</strong></p>
<p>I can write no more than a line or two, the article having left me only a few minutes until posting time. Let me know definitely when I can have ‘Cannon’. It’s a matter of getting the goods off to America at what is (for me) a crucial moment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I haven’t written a word about India. I have got to have some accurate military stuff on the subject, <strong>events</strong> having to some extent discredited myself and the <i>Tribune</i>. <span class="context">[referring to Marx’s estimation that a British storming of Delhi could not succeed]</span></p>
<p>Though my own <strong>financial distress</strong> may be dire indeed, never, since 1849, have I felt <strong>so cosy</strong> as during this <strong>outbreak</strong>. Furthermore you can set Lupus’ mind at rest by telling him that, <strong>now that the whole statement is before us</strong>, I have written an exhaustive <strong>article</strong> for the <i>Tribune</i> in which I show, if only on the basis of the table of <strong>discount-rates</strong> for 1848-54, that the crisis ought by rights to have set in 2 years earlier. Moreover the <strong>delays</strong> are now explicable in such rational terms that even Hegel might, to his great <strong>satisfaction</strong>, have rediscovered the ‘concept’ in the ‘empirical diversity of the world of finite interests’.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i>.</p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. M.</p>
<p>Go on sending me, as you started to do, as many Manchester papers as possible. Not only for the <i>Tribune</i>. I am thinking of writing about the crisis for the benefit of the fatherland.</p>

<h4>[London,] 18 December 1857</h4>
<p><strong>Dear</strong> Frederick,</p>
<p>Just a few lines written in great haste. I've just received a <i>3rd and final warning</i> from the rotten rate collector to the effect that, if I haven’t paid by Monday, they'll put a <strong>broker</strong> in the house on Monday afternoon. <strong>If</strong> possible, <strong>therefore</strong>, send me a few pounds before Monday. Financial <strong>pressure</strong> is now even greater than is <strong>usually</strong> the case with me because, for <strong>about</strong> 3 weeks, I have had to pay for everything <i>in cash</i> and <strong>anything like credit</strong> has ceased, while at the same time 2/3 of all the money I receive immediately goes to meet floating <strong>debts</strong>. Moreover, there is only a very little coming in, since I have hitherto been unable to send the <i>Tribune</i> more than one article. <strong>So far as to private matters</strong>.</p>
<p>I am working enormously, as a rule until 4 o'clock in the morning. I am engaged on a twofold task: 1. Elaborating the outlines of political economy <span class="context">[Marx had begun work on <i>The Grundrisse</i> — “Outline” — in October 1857 and completed it in May 1858]</span>. (For the benefit of the public it is absolutely essential to go into the matter <i>au</i> <i>fond</i> <span class="context">[thoroughly]</span><i>, </i>as it is for my own, <strong>individually, to get rid of this nightmare</strong>.)</p>
<p>2. The <i>present crisis</i>. Apart from the articles for the <i>Tribune</i>, all I do is keep records of it, which, however, takes up a considerable amount of time. I think that, somewhere <strong>about</strong> the spring, we ought to do a pamphlet <i>together</i> about the affair as a reminder to the German public that we are still there as always, and<strong> always the same</strong>. I have started 3 large record books — <strong>England, Germany, France</strong>. All the material on the American affair is available in the <i>Tribune</i>, and can be collated subsequently. By the by, I should be glad if you would send me the <i>Guardian</i> if possible, <i>every day</i>. It not only doubles the work but also disrupts it if I have to deal with a week or so’s arrears all at once.</p>
<p>In France, and specially at <i>Havre</i>, the fun (commercial) will probably be started by the ‘Germans’, whom one cannot altogether help taking into account now. Moreover — apart from the <strong>general round </strong>of the bankrupt State — trade itself would seem to be exceptionally rotten in Marseilles and Bordeaux, everywhere, that is, where infiltration and intervention by foreign elements has stung the beastly <i>crapauds</i>  out of their lousy, mean penny-pinching and <strong>timidity</strong>. <i>Au fond</i>, only in such an immobile country was a Crédit mobilier both possible and inevitable. <strong>The more you become acquainted with the Messiahs of nations, the less you like him</strong>.</p>
<p>Write to me whenever you have the time, for later on you're sure to forget all the ‘<i>chronique scandaleuse</i>’ of the crisis which is so invaluable to us. I make excerpts from your letters and enter them in the principal record books.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i>. Kind regards to Lupus. Pieper has the satisfaction of knowing that his ex-principal Saalfeld, with whose wife he had such a tremendous row, <strong>has gone to the wall</strong>.</p>

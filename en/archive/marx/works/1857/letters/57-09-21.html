<h4>[London,] 21 September 1857<br>
9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, Haverstock Hill</h4>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Nothing could please me more than to hear that your health is progressing.</p>
<p>Last Friday, a letter arrived from Dana, cool and curt. I replied that I would complain to the <strong>Post Office</strong> at once. Further, having ‘<i>Algeria</i>’ and ‘<i>Ammunition</i>’ to hand, I sent them off  with the comment that I had <strong>copies</strong> of them; also that I had ‘Army’ in the original, and would send it off immediately a fresh copy had been made (I did this because in recent letters you have several times mentioned that ‘Army’ was almost finished); also, that ‘<i>Artillery</i>’ would for the most part come under the <strong>History of Cannon</strong> and that I no longer had the manuscript. The <i>only A’s now remaining</i> — and these I would send on the off-chance, although it is probably by now too late — were, all told, ‘Army’, ‘Armada’ and ‘Ayacucho’. I mentioned the last 2 because you can keep them quite short, while the material I have sent you will provide some original stuff on the Armada and Ayacucho (about Espartero). That’s how matters stand.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I shall send off 3 more biographies.</p>
<p>My circumstances won’t permit me to come to Brighton, still less accompany you to Jersey.</p>
<p>On closer examination I find that all I want from you on the generals under B is an answer to my question about Bernadotte together with the essentials concerning Blücher, Bugeaud, Bosquet (in the Crimean War). I have enough on the other Frenchmen. Finally, Sir <i>G. Brown</i>, about whom I know nothing. Not much needed on the man.</p>
<p>I have sent Dana your B and C lists.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i>.</p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. M.</p>

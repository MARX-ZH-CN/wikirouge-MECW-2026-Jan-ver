<h4>[London,] 31 October 1857</h4>
<p><strong>Dear</strong> Frederic,</p>
<p>Have received two letters from Dana. Says first, that ‘<i>Army’ </i>arrived in good time. <i>Secondly</i>, that, because of the <strong>commercial crisis</strong>, notice has been given to all European correspondents except for myself and Bayard Taylor; 1, however, am to confine myself <strong>strictly to 1 article per week — </strong>lately I had been trying to break through this limitation — and for the time being write exclusively about the <strong>Indian war</strong> and the <strong>financial crisis</strong>.</p>
<p>If you could let me have the <strong>History of Cannon</strong> by Friday, <strong>it would be a great boon</strong>. As soon as the next mail arrives from India, you must write to me at some length about the Delhi affair or rather, <strong>if possible</strong>, do the whole article since this time it has to be purely technical.</p>
<p>I sent the chaps <strong>about 8</strong> sheets under the heading ‘Blücher’, the same being sub-titled ‘<strong>The Silesian army in the campaigns etc.’ </strong>As I had to spend so much time reading Clausewitz, Müffling, etc., some degree of compensation was called for.</p>
<p>So far as your resolution as to Manchester is concerned, it seems to me <strong>quite rational</strong>, within Heckscher’s <strong>limitations</strong>. Allen, too, says that fatal consequences are likely to result only if the lung is affected but that, in the early days after such a business, it behoves anyone to take care of himself.</p>
<p>The doses of iron may have been somewhat too strong. At all events it should have an excellent effect on your <strong>body</strong>. The weather here has improved during the past few days.</p>
<p><strong>I should much like, old boy, to see you before your return to Manchester</strong>. There is a certain irony of fate in my being personally embroiled in these damned crises. What <strong>satisfaction</strong> it would give Heinzen <i>s'il le savait</i> <span class="context">[if he knew]</span>!</p>
<p>The news <strong>as to</strong> Schramm is no less saddening for being predictable. What do you say to Cavaignac’s <strong>death</strong> and the idiocy of our liege-lord?</p>
<p>With warm regards from the <strong>whole family</strong>.</p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. M.</p>

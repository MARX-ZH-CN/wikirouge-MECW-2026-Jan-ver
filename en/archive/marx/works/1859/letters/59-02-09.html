<h4>[London,] 9 February 1859 </h4>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>At last a letter from Duncker <i>today. </i>He didn’t receive the manuscript <span class="context">[<i>Contribution to Critique of Political Economy</i>]</span> until 1 February. Not printed this week, because just completing some work or other — I don’t know which — of Lassalle’s.</p>
<p>Enclosed a letter from Eccarius and Pfänder from which you will see that poor Eccarius is down with consumption. This is the most tragic thing I have yet experienced here in London.</p>
<p>Pieper, who had been discharged as cured, is back from Bognor again and in the German hospital. This time starvation treatment. <strong>Serves him right</strong>.</p>
<p>I meant to send you the enclosed letters from Weydemeyer and Komp long ago. I have at last replied to them.</p>
<p>Dronke has been to Bonn, where one of his brothers was dying. Having obtained Flottwell’s permission, he attended a ball given by his [students'] ‘corps’ in Bonn. The little man <span class="context">[Dronke]</span> has written to Dingelstedt (<i>of Fulda</i>), through whom he hopes to arrange a performance of a <i>play</i> he himself has written. In addition, the little man writes ‘Glasgower Briefe’ for Prutz’s <i>Museum</i>. I had all this news from philistine Freiligrath.</p>
<p>From the latter, who came to see me yesterday (I myself being confined to the house with a bad throat), I also learned that Gottfried’s — or Hermann’s — behaviour towards ladies is invariably so ludicrous (the buffoon now supposes he need only throw down his handkerchief) that he has become an object of general <i>dégoût.</i> Moreover, Freiligrath has now also tumbled to the fact that Gottfried feels exceptionally ‘<strong>free and easy’ </strong>now that the Mockel woman is dead and  — strangest of all — <i>it now transpires</i> that, even <i>before the day of the funeral</i>, philistine Freiligrath and wife had discovered brother Hermann’s ‘lack of concern’.</p>
<p>According to Gottfried, the <i>Hermann</i>, to which the Prussian government has, as the Berlin <i>National-Zeitung</i> announces, granted a licence for postal distribution, is to cover the ‘<i>loss</i>’ to his funds occasioned by his wife’s death.</p>
<p>In due course, no doubt, Mrs Daniels will become Mrs Bürgers. She has written to Lina saying that ‘Bürgers has grown <i>still more</i> energetic and self-confident’. In proof of that ‘self-confidence’ she writes, ‘we are delighted by Freiligrath’s poem about Mrs Kinkel, which was mutilated by the “perfidious” <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i>’.</p>
<p>Steffen has written to Freiligrath asking for your address and mine as he has lost them. Steffen’s address is: <i>W. Steffen, Harrison Square near Boston, Mass. U. St.</i></p>
<p><i>Salut</i>.</p>

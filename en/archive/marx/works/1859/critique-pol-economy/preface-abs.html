The first work which I undertook to dispel the doubts assailing me was
a critical re-examination of the Hegelian philosophy of law; the
introduction to this work being published in the <i>Deutsch-Franzosische
Jahrbucher</i>
 issued in Paris in 1844.  My inquiry led me to the
conclusion that neither legal relations nor political forms could be
comprehended whether by themselves or on the basis of a so-called
general development of the human mind, but that on the contrary they
originate in the material conditions of life, the totality of which
Hegel, following the example of English and French thinkers of the
eighteenth century, embraces within the term "civil society"; that the
anatomy of this civil society, however, has to be sought in political
economy.  The study of this, which I began in Paris, I continued in
Brussels, where I moved owing to an expulsion order issued by M.
Guizot.  The general conclusion at which I arrived and which, once
reached, became the guiding principle of my studies, can be summarised
as follows.</span> 
</p>
<p>
In the social <a href="../../../../../glossary/terms/p/r.html#production" target=_blank>production</a> of their life, men enter into definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will, <a href="../../../../../glossary/terms/r/e.html#relations-production" target=_blank>relations of production</a> which correspond to a definite stage of development of their material <a href="../../../../../glossary/terms/p/r.html#productive-forces" target=_blank>productive forces</a>. The sum total of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which rises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="../../../../../glossary/terms/m/o.html#mode-production" target=_blank>mode of production</a> of material life conditions the social, political and intellectual life process in general. It is not the <a href="../../../../../glossary/terms/c/o.html#consciousness" target=_blank>consciousness</a> of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness.
</p>
<p>
 At a certain stage of their development, the material productive forces of society come in conflict with the existing relations of production, or — what is but a legal expression for the same thing — with the <a href="../../../../../glossary/terms/p/r.html#property" target=_blank>property</a> relations within which they have been at work hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. 
</p>
<p>
Then begins an epoch of social revolution. With the change of the economic foundation the entire immense superstructure is more or less rapidly transformed. In considering such transformations a distinction should always be made between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, aesthetic or philosophic — in short, ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out. Just as our opinion of an individual is not based on what he thinks of himself, so can we not judge of such a period of transformation by its own consciousness; on the contrary, this consciousness must be explained rather from the contradictions of material life, from the existing conflict between the social productive forces and the relations of production.
</p>
<p>
No social order ever perishes before all the productive forces for which there is room in it have developed; and new, higher relations of production never appear before the material conditions of their existence have matured in the womb of the old society itself. Therefore mankind always sets itself only such tasks as it can solve; since, looking at the matter more closely, it will always be found that the tasks itself arises only when the material conditions of its solution already exist or are at least in the process of formation. 
</p>
<p>
 In broad outlines Asiatic<sup class="enote"><a href="#e1" id="eb1">[A]</a></sup>, ancient, feudal, and modern bourgeois modes of production can be designated as progressive epochs in the economic formation of society. The bourgeois relations of production are the last antagonistic form of the social process of production — antagonistic not in the sense of individual antagonisms, but of one arising from the social conditions of life of the individuals; at the same time the productive forces developing in the womb of bourgeois society create the material conditions for the solution of that antagonism. This social formation brings, therefore, the prehistory of society to a close.

Frederick Engels, with whom I maintained a constant exchange of ideas
by correspondence since the publication of his brilliant essay on the
critique of economic categories (printed in the <i>Deutsch-Franzosische
Jahrbucher,</i>
 arrived by another road (compare his <i>Lage der arbeitenden
Klasse in England</i>
) at the same result as I, and when in the spring of
1845 he too came to live in Brussels, we decided to set forth together
our conception as opposed to the ideological one of German philosophy,
in fact to settle accounts with our former philosophical conscience. 
The intention was carried out in the form of a critique of
post-Hegelian philosophy. The manuscript [The German Ideology], two
large octavo volumes, had long ago reached the publishers in Westphalia
when we were informed that owing to changed circumstances it could not
be printed.  We abandoned the manuscript to the gnawing criticism of
the mice all the more willingly since we had achieved our main purpose
— self-clarification....</span></p>

<span class="info"><a href="#eb1" id="e1">A.</a></span> As a second footnote to the Communist Manifesto, Engels wrote in 1888: </p>
<p class="quoteb">
In 1847, the pre-history of society, the social organization existing previous to recorded history, [was] all but unknown. Since then, August von Haxthausen (1792-1866) discovered common ownership of land in Russia, Georg Ludwig von Maurer proved it to be the social foundation from which all Teutonic races started in history, and, by and by, village communities were found to be, or to have been, the primitive form of society everywhere from India to Ireland. The inner organization of this primitive communistic society was laid bare, in its typical form, by Lewis Henry Morgan's (1818-1861) crowning discovery of the true nature of the gens and its relation to the tribe. With the dissolution of the primeval communities, society begins to be differentiated into separate and finally antagonistic classes. I have attempted to retrace this dissolution in <a href="../../1884/origin-family/index.html" target=_blank>The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State</a>, second edition, Stuttgart, 1886. </p>

Thus, as the science of understanding pre-history progressed (pre-history being that time before written records of human civilization exist), Marx &amp; Engels changed their understanding and descriptions accordingly. In the above text, Marx mentions “Asiatic” modes of production. At the time, they had thought Asian civilization was the first we could speak of humanity (an understanding based on Hegel, see: <a href="../../../../../reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prstate.html#PR341" target=_blank>The Oriental Realm</a>). After writing <a href="../../1857/grundrisse/ch09.html" target=_blank><i>The Grundrisse</i></a>, they dropped the idea of a distinct Asiatic mode of production, and kept four basic forms: tribal, ancient, feudal, and capitalist.</p>

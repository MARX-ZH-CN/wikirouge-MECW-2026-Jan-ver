<p class="information" style="margin-left: 100px;"><span class="term" style="color: #006600;">Questions for discussion:</span><br>
<span class="date">
1. What does “consanguinity” mean and what is meant by the “consanguine family”?<br>
2. Marx notes Morgan's observation about “systems of consanguity” and says “the same is true of the political, juridical, religious, and philosophical systems in general”. What exactly did he mean by this?<br>
3. What argument does Engels use to reject the idea that pair-bonding was the form of family at the very beginning of human development?<br>
4. So far as you know, in what sense are all forms of family known in human societies different from anything found, for instance, among the primates, if any?<br>
5. What vestiges of mother-right do you see in your own modern society?<br>
6. What do you know of the marriage practices, taboos, rights of inheritance, and so on, in the history of the indigenous people of your own country?<br>
7. What, according to Engels, is the relation between monogamy and the overthrow of mother-right?<br>
8. What does Engels see as the cause for the fall of mother-right and the institution of monogamy?<br>
9. What do you make of: “The first class opposition that appears in history coincides with the development of the antagonism between man and woman in monogamous marriage, and the first class oppression coincides with that of the female sex by the male.”?<br>
10. Do you think Engels regards monogamy as the highest form of family possible, as the ideal form, so to speak? Or is Engels hinting at future forms of family relationship beyond capitalism?<br>
11. What does Engels say is/will be the impact of capitalism on the family?<br>

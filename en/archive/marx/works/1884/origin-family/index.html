<h3>Introduction </h3>
<p class="information"><span class="cap">A</span>fter Marx’s death, in
rumaging through Marx’s manuscripts, Engels came upon <a href="marx-conspectus.html" target=_blank>Marx’s precis</a> of <i><a href="introd.html" target=_blank>Ancient Society</a></i> – a book by progressive US
scholar <a href="../../../../../glossary/people/m/o.html#morgan-henry" target=_blank>Lewis
Henry Morgan</a> and published in London 1877. The precis was written between
1880-81 and contained Marx’s numerous remarks on Morgan as well as
passages from other sources. </p>
<p class="information">After reading the precis, Engels set out to write a
special treatise – which he saw as fulfilling Marx’s will. Working
on the book, he used Marx’s precis, and some of Morgan’s factual
material and conclusions. He also made use of many and diverse data gleaned in
his own studies of the history of Greece, Rome, Old Ireland, and the Ancient
Germans. </p>
<p class="information">It would, of course, become <i>The Origin of the
Family, Private Property and the State</i> – the first edition of which
was published October 1884 in Hottingen-Zurich. </p>
<p class="information">Engels wrote <i>The Origin of the Family, Private
Property and the State</i> in just two months – beginning toward the end
of March 1884 and completing it by the end of May. It focuses on early human
history, following the disintegration of the primitive community and the
emergence of a class society based on private property. Engels looks into the
origin and essence of the state, and concludes it is bound to wither away
leaving a classless society. </p>
<p class="information" style="margin-left: 80pt;">Engels: “Along with
[the classes] the state will inevitably fall. Society, which will reorganise
production on the basis of a free and equal association of the producers, will
put the whole machinery of state where it will then belong: into the museum of
antiquity, by the side of the spinning-wheel and the bronze axe.” </p>
<p class="information">In 1890, having gathered new material on the history of
primitive society, Engels set about preparing a new edition of his book. He
studied the latest books on the subject – including those of Russian
historian Maxim Kovalevsky. (The fourth edition, Stuttgart, 1892, was dedicated
to Kovalevsky.) As a result, he introduced a number of changes in his original
text and also considerable insertions. </p>
<p class="information">In 1894, Engels’s book appeared in Russian
translation. It was the first of Engels’s works published legally in
Russia. Lenin would later describe it as “one of the fundamental works of
modern socialism.” </p>

<h4>Paris, 2 November 1846<br>
23, rue de Lille</h4>
<p>Where is the long letter you promised so long ago? <i>Make sure you send Bernays the manuscript</i>, he only needs what you have<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#124" target=_blank>[124]</a></sup> since he still has the printed stuff. He has sent nothing to America; whatever may have appeared there was printed without his knowledge or consent. <span class="context">[K. L. Bernays, Das entschleierte Geheimniss der Criminal-Justiz. Eine kommunistische Anschauungsweise, Der Volks-Tribun, 27 June and 4 July 1846]</span> However a lot of copies were printed, and some may have gone as presents from Leske to all points of the compass. We shall investigate the matter. Perhaps through Grün or Börnstein. I have written to Switzerland about the manuscripts, <span class="context">[reference to The German Ideology]</span> but it would seem that the cur <span class="context">[J. M. Schläpter]</span> has no intention of replying.<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#125" target=_blank>[125]</a></sup> Apart from him, there’s no one but Jenni; I've played a prank on him and would rather not write, enclose a short note for the fellow in your next. I shall send it on, but it’s only for form’s sake, the fellow’s almost certain to refuse. The first man wrote to published a short pamphlet by Bernays <span class="context">[Rothschild. Ein Urtheilsspruch vom menschlichen Standpunkte aus]</span>, but even if he does take the thing, it would appear, <i>à ce qu'écrit</i> Püttmann, that he is bankrupt. <i>Voilà</i>. I despair of Switzerland. Good advice costs money. Things being what they are, we shall certainly not get rid of 2 volumes together. At most 2 volumes to 2 different publishers. Write about this as well.</p>

<p>I have only just read what the little man <span class="context">[Karl Ludwig Bernays]</span> has written above about his flight from solitude. It’s a good thing we've got him here. He is gradually cheering up again. Greetings to the whole <i>boutique</i>.</p>

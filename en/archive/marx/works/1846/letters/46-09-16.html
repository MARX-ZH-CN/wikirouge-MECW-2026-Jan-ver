<i>Committee No. 2</i>
<p class="fst">[Paris,] Wednesday, 16 September 1846

<p class="fst">Dear Friends,

<p class="fst">Your news about Belgium, London and Breslau
<a href="#n1">[1]</a> was of great interest to me. <a href="#n2">[2]</a>
I told Ewerbeck and Bernays what was of interest to them. Keep me <i>au
fait</i> <a href="#n3">[3]</a> as well with the success of our enterprise
and <i>plus ou moins</i> <a href="#n4">[4]</a> the enthusiasm with which
the various localities are taking part, so that I can expatiate on that
to the workers here in so far as it is politic. What are the Cologne people
<a href="#n5">[5]</a> doing?

<p class="fst">There's all manner of news from here.

<p class="fst">

I've had several meetings with the local workers, i.e. with the leaders
of the cabinet-makers from the Faubourg St. Antoine. These people are curiously
organised. Apart from the business of their league <a href="#n6">[6]</a>
having been thrown into the utmost confusion -- as a result of a serious
dispute with the Weitlingian tailors -- these lads, i.e. 12-20 of them,
foregather once a week; they used to hold discussions but, after they ran
out of matter, as indeed they were bound to do, Ewerbeck was compelled
to give them lectures on German history -- starting from scratch -- and
on an extremely muddled political economy, a popular rendering of the
<i>Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher</i>. <a href="#n7">[7]</a> Meanwhile I
appeared. In order to establish contact with them, I twice discussed
conditions in Germany since the French Revolution, my point of departure
being the economic relations. What they glean from these weekly meetings is
thrashed out on Sundays at Barriere meetings <a href="#n8">[8]</a> attended
by Cherethites and Pelethites, wife and children. <a href="#n9">[9]</a> Here
 -- <i>abstraction faite de toute espace de politique</i> <a href="#n10">[10]</a> -- such things as 'social questions' are discussed. It
is a good way of attracting new people, for it's entirely public; a fortnight
ago the police arrived and wanted to impose a veto but allowed themselves to
be placated and did nothing further. Often more than 200 people
foregather.


<p class="fst">Things cannot possibly remain as they are now. A degree of lethargy
has set in amongst the fellows which comes from their being bored with
themselves. For they have nothing to set against the tailors' communism
but popularisations <i>a la</i> Grun and green-tinted <a href="#n11">[11]</a>
Proudhon, <a href="#n12">[12]</a> all this having been laboriously dinned
into them, partly by no less a person than Mr Grun himself, partly by an
old, bombastic master cabinet-maker and minion of Grun's, Papa Eisermann,
but partly, too, by <i>amicus</i> <a href="#n13">[13]</a> Ewerbeck. Naturally
they soon ran dry, endless repetition ensued and, to prevent them going
to <i>sleep</i> (literally, this was getting worse and worse at the sessions),
Ewerbeck torments them with hair-splitting disquisitions on 'true value' 
(this last being somewhat on my conscience) and bores them with the primeval
forests of the Teutons, Hermann the Cheruscan, and the most ghastly old
German etymology according to Adelung, all of it quite wrong. By the way,
the real leader of these people isn't Ewerbeck but Junge, who was in Brussels
<a href="#n14">[14]</a>; the fellow realises very well what ought to be
changed, and might do a great deal since he has them all in his pocket
and is ten times more intelligent than the whole clique, but he vacillates
too much and always has some new bee in his bonnet. I haven't seen him
for nearly 3 weeks -- he never turned up and isn't to be found -- which
is why so little has as yet been achieved. Without him most of them are
spineless and irresolute. But one must be patient with the fellows; in
the first place we must rid ourselves of Grun, whose enervating influence,
both direct and indirect, has been truly dreadful. And then, when we've
got these platitudes out of their heads, I hope to be able to achieve something
with the fellows, for they all have a strong desire for instruction in
economics. This should not take long, as Ewerbeck who, despite his notorious
muddle-headedness, now at its fullest flowering, has the best intentions
in the world, is completely in my pocket, and Junge, too, is wholly on
my side. I have discussed the correspondence <a href="#n15">[15]</a> with
six others; the plan was much acclaimed, specially by Junge, and will be
implemented from here. But unless Grun's personal influence is destroyed
and his platitudes eradicated, thus reinvigorating the chaps, nothing can
be done in view of the considerable material obstacles to be faced (particularly
engagements almost every evening). I have offered to confront Grun in their
presence and to tax him with his personal rascalities, and Bernays also
wishes to be there -- Ewerbeck too has a bone to pick with him. This will
happen as soon as they have settled their own affairs with Grun, i.e. obtained
a guarantee for the money advanced for the printing of Grun's <i>Landtag</i>
shit. <a href="#n17">[17]</a> But since Junge didn't turn up and the rest
behaved towards Grun-like children, that matter, too, is still not in order,
although with a little effort it could have been settled in 5 minutes.
The unfortunate thing about it is that most of these fellows are Swabians.

<p class="fst">

Now for something to amuse you. In his new, as yet unprinted book, which
Grun is translating, <a href="#n18">[18]</a> Proudhon has a great scheme
for making money out of thin air and bringing the kingdom of heaven closer
to all workers. No one knew what it was. Grun, while keeping it very dark,
was always bragging about his philosopher's stone. General suspense. At
length, last week, Papa Eisermann was at the cabinet-makers' and so was
I; gradually the old coxcomb came out with it, in a naively secretive manner.
Mr Grun had confided the whole plan to him. Hearken, now, to the grandeur
of this plan for world redemption: <i>ni plus ni moins</i> <a href="#n19">[19]</a>
than the already long extant in England, and ten times bankrupt LABOUR-BAZARS
or LABOUR-MARKETS, associations of all artisans of all trades, a big warehouse,
all work delivered by the <i>associes</i> valued strictly in accordance
with the cost of the raw product plus labour, and paid for in other association
products, similarly valued. <a href="#n20">[20]</a> Anything delivered
in excess of the association's needs is to be sold on the world market,
the proceeds being paid out to the producers. In this way the crafty Proudhon
calculates that he and his fellow <i>associes</i> will circumvent the profit
of the middleman. That this would also mean circumventing the profit on
<i>his association's capital</i>, that this capital and this profit must
be <i>just</i> as <i>great</i> as the capital and profit of the circumvented
middlemen, that he therefore throws away with his right hand what the left
has received, has none of it entered his clever head. That his workers
can never raise the necessary capital, since otherwise they could just
as well set themselves up separately, that any savings in cost resulting
from the association would be more than outweighed by the enormous risk,
that the whole thing would amount to spiriting away profit from this world,
while leaving the producers of the profit to cool their heels, that it
is a truly Straubingerian idyll, <a href="#n21">[21]</a> excluding from
the very outset all large-scale industry, building, agriculture, etc.,
that they would have to bear only the <i>losses</i> of the bourgeoisie
without sharing in its gains, all these and a hundred other self-evident
objections he overlooks, so delighted is he with his plausible illusion.
It's all too utterly preposterous. Paterfamilias Grun, of course, believes
in the new redemption and already in his mind's eye sees himself at the
head of an association of 20,000 <i>ouvriers</i> <a href="#n22">[22]</a>
(they want it <i>big</i> from the start), his family, of course, to receive
free clothing, board and lodging. But if Proudhon comes out with this,
he will be making a fool of himself and all French socialists and communists
in the eyes of bourgeois economists. Hence those tears, that polemicising
against revolution <a href="#n23">[23]</a> because he had a peaceable nostrum
up his sleeve. Proudhon is just like John Watts. In spite of his disreputable
atheism and socialism, the latter regards it as his vocation to acquire
respectability in the eyes of the bourgeoisie; Proudhon, despite his polemic
against the economists, does his utmost to gain recognition as a great
economist. Such are the sectarians. Besides, it's such an old story! <a href="#n24">[24]</a>
<p class="fst">

Now for another highly curious affair. -- The Augsburg <i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i>
of 21 July, Paris, 16 July. Article on the <i>Russian</i> Embassy <a href="#n25">[25]</a>
...


<p class="fst">
 "That is the official Embassy -- but quite extraneous to it, or rather
<i>above</i> it, there is a certain Mr <i>Tolstoy</i> who bears no title,
is described, however, as '<i>confidant of the Court.'</i> Formerly, with
the Ministry of Education, he came to Paris charged with a <i>Literary
mission;</i> there he wrote a few memoirs for his Ministry, sent them a
few reports on the French daily press, then wrote no more but did all the
more. He maintains a splendid establishment, is invited everywhere, receives
everyone, busies himself with everything, knows everything and arranges
much. He seems to me to he the <i>actual Russian Ambassador</i> in Paris....
His intervention works wonders" ( -- all Poles seeking a pardon addressed
themselves to him -- ) "-- at the Embassy <i>all bow down before him and
in Petersburg he is held in great regard</i>." 

<p class="fst">
This Tolstoy is none other than our Tolstoy, that noble fellow who told
us untruthfully that he wanted to sell his estates in Russia. <a href="#n26">[26]</a>
Besides the apartment to which he took us, the man has a magnificent <i>hotel
<a href="#n27">[27]</a> in the rue Mathurin where he receives the diplomats.
This has long been known to the Poles and to many</i> of the French, but
not to the German radicals amongst whom he thought it better to insinuate
himself as a radical. The above article was written by a Pole known to
Bernays, and was immediately taken up by the <i>Corsaire-Satan</i> and
the <i>National</i>. On reading the article, all Tolstoy did was laugh
heartily and crack jokes about having been found out at last. He is now
in London, where he will try his luck, being played out here. It's a pity
he is not coming back, otherwise I'd have had a joke or two to try out
on him, eventually leaving my card in the rue Mathurin. After this, <i>c'est
clair</i> <a href="#n28">[28]</a> that Annenkov, whom he recommended, is
also a Russian informer. Even Bakunin, who <i>must have known</i> the whole
story since the other Russians knew it, is very suspect. I shall, of course,
give him no hint of this, but wreak vengeance on the Russians. Even though
these spies may not constitute any particular threat to us, we can't let
them get away with it. They're good subjects for conspiratorial experiments
<i>in corpore vili</i>. <a href="#n29">[29]</a> For that they are not really
too bad.

<p class="fst">

Father Hess. After I had happily consigned his spouse, <a href="#n30">[30]</a>
cursing and swearing about same, to oblivion, i.e. to the furthest end
of the Faubourg St. Antoine where there is a wailing and gnashing of teeth
(Grun and Gsell), I received not long since, through the agency of one
Reinhardt, another letter in which the communist papa sought to re-establish
relations. It's enough to make one split one's sides. As if nothing had
happened of course, altogether <i>in dulci jubilo</i>, <a href="#n31">[31]</a>
and moreover altogether the same old Hess. After the remark that he was
to some extent reconciled with 'the party' (the 'Yiddish' Circle appears
to have become insolvent) -- and 'also anxious to resume work' (which event
ought to be rung in with a peal of bells), comes the following historical
note (dated 19 August):


<p class="fst">
 'A few weeks ago we were <i>within a hair's breadth</i> of a <i>bloody</i>
riot here in Cologne, <i>Large numbers</i> being already armed' (among
them certainly not Moses). 'The affair did not come to a head because the
military <i>did not put in an appearance'</i> (tremendous triumph for Cologne's
pint-sized philistine), etc., etc...'

<p class="fst">
Then he tells of the civic assemblies <a href="#n32">[32]</a> where 'we',
i.e. 'the party' and Mr Moses, '<i>qua</i> communists, <i>won so complete
a victory</i> that we', etc.

<p class="fst">
'We <i>drove</i>, first the moneyed aristocrats ... and then the petty
bourgeois, <i>with glory'</i> (none of them possessing any talent) <i>'from
the field.</i> Eventually we <i>could have</i> (!) <i>carried everything</i>
in the assemblies' (e.g. made Moses Chief Burgomaster); 'a programme was
adopted to which the assembly pledged its candidates, and which' (hear,
hear) <i>'could not have been more radical even if drawn up by English
and French communists'</i> (!!!) (and by no one understood more foolishly
than by Moses).... <i>'Keep</i> an occasional eye' (sic) 'on my [wife]'
(both parties would like me to take over the distaff side at my own expense
and risk, <i>j'en ai les preuves <a href="#n33">[33]</a>).... 'and pass
this onto Ewerbeck as a heartener.'</i>
<p class="fst">
May God bless this 'heartener', this manna from the desert. I, of course,
completely ignore the beast -- he has now written to Ewerbeck too (and
this simply in order that a letter may be conveyed to his distaff side
at the former's expense), and is threatening to come here in two months'
time. If he visits me, I think I too shall be able to tell him something
by way of a 'heartener'.

<p class="fst">Now that I'm in full swing, I might as well conclude by telling
you that Heine is here again and that the day before yesterday Ewerbeck
and I went to see him. The poor devil is dreadfully low. He has grown as
thin as a rake. The softening of the brain is spreading, and so is the
facial paralysis. Ewerbeck says he might very easily die of pulmonary paralysis
or of a sudden cerebral stroke, but could also drag on, sometimes better,
sometimes worse, for another three or four years yet. He is, of course,
somewhat depressed, melancholy and -- most significant of all -- extremely
benign (and, indeed, seriously so) in his judgments -- Maurer is the only
person about whom he constantly cracks jokes. For the rest his intellectual
vigour is unimpaired, but his appearance, made stranger still by a greying
beard (he can no longer be shaved round the mouth), is enough to plunge
anyone who sees him into the depths of depression. The impression made
by the sight of so splendid a fellow gradually wasting away is exceedingly
painful.

<p class="fst"><img align="RIGHT" alt="sketch of man with moustache" border="0" src="../../cw/volume38/38-066.gif"/> I have also seen
the great Maurer. "Manikin, manikin, how little you weigh!" The man's really
a sight worth seeing, and I was atrociously rude to him, in return for
which the jackass evinces a particular affection for me, and tells me I
have a kindly face. He resembles Karl Moor six weeks dead. Reply soon.

Write soon, as I shall in a fortnight's time [...] from here; such a business
a letter [...] easily remain lying or be refused at the old place.

<p class="fst">At the <i>Fraternite</i> there has been a tremendous dispute between
materialists <a href="#n34">[34]</a> and spiritualists.<a href="#n35">[35]</a>
The materialists, outvoted by 23 to 22, walked out. But that has not stopped
the <i>Fraternite</i> from publishing a very nice article on the various
stages of civilisation and their ability to continue developing in the
direction of communism. <a href="#n36">[36]</a>
<p class="fst">You'll be amused by the following: <i>Journal des economistes</i>,
August of this year, contains, in an article on Biedermann's article on
communism, <a href="#n37">[37]</a> the following: First, all Hess' nonsense,
comically Gallicised; next, we read, comes M. Marx.

<p class="fst">
'M. Marx est un <i>cordonnier</i>, comme un autre Communiste allemand,
Weitling, est un tailleur. Le premier (Mx) n'a pas une grande estime pour
le communisme francais (!) qu'il a ete assez heureux d'etudier sur les
lieux. M. ne sort (du) reste point non plus' (do you not recognise Mr Fix
in this Alsatian expression?) 'des formules abstraites et ie se garde bien
d'aborder aucune question veritablement pratique. Selon lui' (note the
nonsense) 'l'emancipation du peuple allemand sera le signal de l'emancipation
du genre humain; la tete de cette emancipation serait la philosophie et
son coeur le proletariat. Lorsque tout sera prepare, le coq gaulois sonnera
la resurrection germanique... Marx dit qu'il <i>faut creer</i> en Allemagne
un proletariat universel (!!) afin de realiser la pensee philosophique
do Cornmunisme'. [38] Signed T. F. (mort depuis).[39]

<p class="fst">
That was his last work. The previous issue carried an equally comical review
of my book. [40] The September number contains an article
on Julius which I have not yet read. [41]

NOTES<br>
<i>From MECW</i></h3>
<a id="n1"></a><strong>[1]</strong> Polish name: Wroclaw.

<p class="fst"><a id="n2"></a><strong>[2]</strong> The letter of Marx and other members
of the Brussels Communist Correspondence Committee to Engels mentioned
here has not been found.

<p class="fst"><a id="n3"></a><strong>[3]</strong> "acquainted"

<p class="fst"><a id="n4"></a><strong>[4]</strong> "more or less"

<p class="fst"><a id="n5"></a><strong>[5]</strong> Roland Daniels, Heinrich Burgers,
Karl d'Ester

<p class="fst"><a id="n6"></a><strong>[6]</strong> A reference to the Paris communities
of the League of the Just.

<p class="fst"><a id="n7"></a><strong>[7]</strong> Reference is probably to Engels' 'Outlines
of a Critique of Political Economy'.

<p class="fst"><a id="n8"></a><strong>[8]</strong> <i>Barriere meetings</i> were Sunday
assemblies of members of the League of the Just held at the Paris city
gates (barrieres). As a police agent reported on 1 February 1845, 30 to
200 German emigrants gathered in premises rented for this purpose from
a wine-merchant in avenue de Vincennes near the city gate.

<p class="fst"><a id="n9"></a><strong>[9]</strong> 2 Samuel 8:18; 15:18; 20:7, 23

<p class="fst"><a id="n10"></a><strong>[10]</strong> "all politics apart"

<p class="fst"><a id="n11"></a><strong>[11]</strong> A play on Grun (green)

<p class="fst"><a id="n12"></a><strong>[12]</strong> By 'tailors' communism' Engels means
the utopian communism of W. Weitling and his followers.

<p class="fst">Karl Grun, who visited Paris in 1846-47, preached 'true socialism'
and Proudhon's petty-bourgeois reformist ideas among the German workers.

<p class="fst"><a id="n13"></a><strong>[13]</strong> "friend"

<p class="fst"><a id="n14"></a><strong>[14]</strong> Adolph Junge, a cabinet-maker from
Dusseldorf, was a notable figure in the Paris communities of the League
of the Just in the early 1840s. At the end of June 1846, after a short
visit to Cologne, he returned to Paris via Brussels where he met Marx and
Engels. In Paris he vigorously opposed Grun and other advocates of 'true
socialism' and became an associate of Engels when the latter was in Paris.
At the end of March 1847, the French police expelled Junge from the country.

<p class="fst"><a id="n15"></a><strong>[15]</strong> 5 May 1856

<p class="fst"><a id="n17"></a><strong>[17]</strong> [K. Grun,] <i>Die preussischen
Landtags-Abschiede.</i>
<p class="fst"><a id="n18"></a><strong>[18]</strong> Grun's German translation of Proudhon's
book was published in Darmstadt in February (Volume I) and in May (Volume
II) 1847 under the title <i>Philosophie der Staatsökonomie oder Notwendigkeit
des Elends</i>.

<p class="fst"><a id="n19"></a><strong>[19]</strong> "neither more nor less"

<p class="fst"><a id="n20"></a><strong>[20]</strong> By <i>labour-bazars</i> or <i>labour
markets</i> Engels means equitable-labour exchange bazars which were organised
by the Owenites and Ricardian socialists (John Gray, William Thompson,
John Bray) in various towns of England in the 1830s for fair exchange without
a capitalist intermediary. The products were exchanged for labour notes,
or labour money, certificates showing the cost of the products delivered,
calculated on the basis of the amount of labour necessary for their production.
The organisers considered these bazars as a means for publicising the advantages
of a non-capitalist form of exchange and a peaceful way -- together with
cooperatives -- of transition to socialism. The subsequent and invariable
bankruptcy of such enterprises proved their utopian character.

<p class="fst"><a id="n21"></a><strong>[21]</strong> <i>Straubingers</i> -- travelling
journeymen in Germany. Marx and Engels used this term for German artisans,
including some participants in the working-class movement of that time,
who were still largely swayed by guild prejudices and cherished the petty-bourgeois
illusion that it was possible to return from capitalist large-scale industry
to petty handicraft production.

<p class="fst"><a id="n22"></a><strong>[22]</strong> "workers"

<p class="fst"><a id="n23"></a><strong>[23]</strong> Engels refers to Proudhon's letter
to Marx of 17 May 1846, in which he turned down a proposal to work in the
correspondence committees.

<p class="fst"><a id="n24"></a><strong>[24]</strong> H. Heine, 'Ein Jungling liebt cm
Maedchen' from <i>Lyrisches Intermezzo.</i>
<p class="fst"><a id="n25"></a><strong>[25]</strong> Engels quotes from the article 'Die
russische Allianz und die russisehe Gesandtschaft'.

<p class="fst"><a id="n26"></a><strong>[26]</strong> Engels had been misled by Karl Bernays
and Heinrich Bornstein as he later pointed out in his letter to Marx of
15 January 1847. The item in the <i>Allgemeine Zeitung</i> dealt with the
tsarist spy V. N. Tolstoy and not with the Russian liberal landowner G.
M. Tolstoy whose acquaintance Marx and Engels had made in Paris.

<p class="fst"><a id="n27"></a><strong>[27]</strong> "mansion"

<p class="fst"><a id="n28"></a><strong>[28]</strong> "it's clear"

<p class="fst"><a id="n29"></a><strong>[29]</strong> "on the vile body"

<p class="fst"><a id="n30"></a><strong>[30]</strong> Sibylle Hess

<p class="fst"><a id="n31"></a><strong>[31] "</strong>sweetness and joy"

<p class="fst"><a id="n32"></a><strong>[32]</strong> During the campaign for the elections
to the local councils in Cologne which started at the end of June 1846,
it was obvious at the very first meetings that the Cologne communists had
a considerable influence on the petty-bourgeois electors (the Prussian
workers were virtually deprived of suffrage). In the course of the election
campaign, disorders took place in Cologne on 3 and 4 August, and were suppressed
by the army. The people indignantly demanded that the troops should be
withdrawn to their barracks and a civic militia organised. Karl d'Ester,
a Cologne communist, described these disturbances in an unsigned pamphlet
<i>Bericht iber die Ereignine</i> za <i>KoIn</i> vow 3. <i>und 4. Augstst
und den folgenden Tagen</i>, published in Mannheim in 1846.

<p class="fst"><a id="n33"></a><strong>[33]</strong> "have proof of it"

<p class="fst"><a id="n34"></a><strong>[34]</strong> By <i>materialists</i> Engels meant
associates of Theodore Dezamy and other revolutionary representatives of
French utopian communism who drew the socialist conclusions from the teaching
of the eighteenth-century Frencls materialist philosophers. In the 1840s
there existed in France a society of materialist communists which consisted
of workers; in July 1847 eleven of its members were brought to trial by
the French authorities.

<p class="fst"><a id="n35"></a><strong>[35]</strong> By <i>spiritualists</i> Engels must
have meant the editors of the <i>Fraternite</i> who were influenced by
the religious-socialist ideas of Pierre Leroux, and by the "Christian socialism"
of Philippe Buchez and Felicite Lamennais.

<p class="fst"><a id="n36"></a><strong>[36]</strong> Engels seems to be writing about
a series of articles 'La civilisation' published in the <i>Fraternite</i>
in 1845 and 1846. The first article was entitled 'La civilisation est l'acheminement
de l'esprit humain vers la communaute".

<p class="fst"><a id="n37"></a><strong>[37]</strong> The reference is to a review of
K. Biedermann, 'Unsrc Gegenwart und Zukunft' written by Th. Fix and published
in the <i>Journal des Economistes</i>, Vol. 15, No.57, August 1846.

<p class="title">Capital Vol. III Part III<br>
The Law of the Tendency of the Rate of Profit to Fall</p>
<h1>Chapter 15. Exposition of the Internal Contradictions of the Law</h1>
<p> </p>
<h4>I. General</h4>
<p class="fst">We have seen in the first part of this book that the rate of
profit expresses the rate of surplus-value always lower than it actually is. We
have just seen that even a rising rate of surplus-value has a tendency to
express itself in a falling rate of profit. The rate of profit would equal the
rate of surplus-value only if c = 0, <i>i.e. </i>, if the total capital were
paid out in wages. A falling rate of profit does not express a falling rate of
surplus-value, unless the proportion of the value of the constant capital to
the quantity of labour-power which sets it in motion remains unchanged or the
amount of labour-power increases in relation to the value of the constant
capital.</p>
<p>On the plea of analysing the rate of profit, Ricardo actually analyses the
rate of surplus-value alone, and this only on the assumption that the
working-day is intensively and extensively a constant magnitude.</p>
<p>A fall in the rate of profit and accelerated accumulation are different
expressions of the same process only in so far as both reflect the development
of productiveness. Accumulation, in turn, hastens the fall of the rate of
profit, inasmuch as it implies concentration of labour on a large scale, and
thus a higher composition of capital. On the other hand, a fall in the rate of
profit again hastens the concentration of capital and its centralisation
through expropriation of minor capitalists, the few direct producers who still
have anything left to be expropriated. This accelerates accumulation with
regard to mass, although the rate of accumulation falls with the rate of
profit.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the rate of self-expansion of the total capital, or the
rate of profit, being the goad of capitalist production (just as self-expansion
of capital is its only purpose), its fall checks the formation of new
independent capitals and thus appears as a threat to the development of the
capitalist production process. It breeds over-production, speculation, crises,
and surplus-capital alongside surplus-population. Those economists, therefore,
who, like Ricardo, regard the capitalist mode of production as absolute, feel
at this point that it creates a barrier itself, and for this reason attribute
the barrier to Nature (in the theory of rent), not to production. But the main
thing about their horror of the falling rate of profit is the feeling that
capitalist production meets in the development of its productive forces a
barrier which has nothing to do with the production of wealth as such; and this
peculiar barrier testifies to the limitations and to the merely historical,
transitory character of the capitalist mode of production; testifies that for
the production of wealth, it is not an absolute mode, moreover, that at a
certain stage it rather conflicts with its further development.</p>
<p>True, Ricardo and his school considered only industrial profit, which
includes interest. But the rate of ground-rent likewise has a tendency to fall,
although its absolute mass increases, and may also increase proportionately
more than industrial profit. (E. West, [<i>Essay on the Application of Capital
to Land, </i>London, 1815<i>. — Ed</i>] who developed the law of
ground-rent <i>before </i>Ricardo.) If we consider the total social capital
C, and use p<sub class="eq">1</sub> for the industrial profit that remains
after deducting interest and ground-rent, i for interest, and r for
ground-rent, then s/C = p/C = p<sub class="eq">1</sub> + i + r/C = p<sub class="eq">1</sub>/C + i/C + r/C. We have seen that while s, the total amount
of surplus-value, is continually increasing in the course of capitalist
development, s/C is just as steadily declining, because C grows still more
rapidly than s. Therefore it is by no means a contradiction for p<sub class="eq">1</sub>, i, and r to be steadily increasing, each individually,
while s/C = p/C, as well as p<sub class="eq">1</sub>/C, i/C, and r/C, should
each by itself be steadily shrinking, or that p<sub class="eq">1</sub> should
increase in relation to i, or r in relation to p<sub class="eq">1</sub> or to
p<sub class="eq">1</sub> and i. With a rising total surplus-value or profit s =
p, and a simultaneously falling rate of profit s/C = p/C, the proportions of
the parts p<sub class="eq">1</sub>, i, and r, which make up s = p, may change
at will within the limits set by the total amount of s without thereby
affecting the magnitude of s or s/C.</p>
<p>The mutual variation of p<sub class="eq">1</sub>, i, and r is merely a
varying distribution of s among different classes. Consequently, p<sub class="eq">1</sub>/C, i/C, or r/C, the rate of individual industrial profit,
the rate of interest, and the ratio of ground-rent to the total capital, may
rise in relation to one another, while s/C, the general rate of profit, falls.
The only condition is that the sum of all three = s/C. If the rate of profit
falls from 50% to 25%, because the composition of a certain capital with, say,
a rate of surplus-value = 100% has changed from 50<sub class="eq">c</sub> +
50<sub class="eq">v</sub> to 75<sub class="eq">c</sub> + 25<sub class="eq">v</sub>, then a capital of 1,000 will yield a profit of 500 in the
first case, and in the second a Capital of 4,000 will yield a profit of 1,000.
We see that s or p have doubled, while p' has fallen by one-half. And if that
50% was formerly divided into 20 profit, 10 interest, and 20 rent, then p<sub class="eq">1</sub>/C = 20%, i/C = 10%, and r/C = 20%. If the proportions had
remained the same after the change from 50% to 25%, then p<sub class="eq">1</sub>/C = 10%, i/C = 5%, and r/C = 10%. If, however, p<sub class="eq">1</sub>/C should fall to 8% and i/C to 4%, then r/C would rise to
13%. The relative magnitude of r would have risen as against p<sub class="eq">1</sub> and i, while p would have remained the same. Under both
assumptions, the sum of p<sub class="eq">1</sub>, i, and r would have
increased, because produced by a capital four times as large. Furthermore,
Ricardo's assumption that originally industrial profit (plus interest) contains
the entire surplus-value is historically and logically false. It is rather the
progress of capitalist production which 1) gives the whole profit directly to
the industrial and commercial capitalists for further distribution, and 2)
reduces rent to the excess over the profit. On this capitalist basis, again,
the rent grows, being a portion of profit (<i>i.e. </i>, of the surplus-value
viewed as the product of the total capital), but not that specific portion of
the product, which the capitalist pockets.</p>
<p>Given the necessary means of production, <i>i.e. </i>, a sufficient
accumulation of capital, the creation of surplus-value is only limited by the
labouring population if the rate of surplus-value, <i>i.e. </i>, the
intensity of exploitation, is given; and no other limit but the intensity of
exploitation if the labouring population is given. And the capitalist process
of production consists essentially of the production of surplus-value,
represented in the surplus-product or that aliquot portion of the produced
commodities materialising unpaid labour. It must never be forgotten that the
production of this surplus-value — and the reconversion of a portion of
it into capital, or the accumulation, forms an integrate part of this
production of surplus-value — is the immediate purpose and compelling
motive of capitalist production. It will never do, therefore, to represent
capitalist production as something which it is not, namely as production whose
immediate purpose is enjoyment or the manufacture of the means of enjoyment for
the capitalist. This would be overlooking its specific character, which is
revealed in all its inner essence.</p>
<p>The creation of this surplus-value makes up the direct process of
production, which, as we have said, has no other limits but those mentioned
above. As soon as all the surplus-labour it was possible to squeeze out has
been embodied in commodities, surplus-value has been produced. But this
production of surplus-value completes but the first act of the capitalist
process of production — the direct production process. Capital has
absorbed so and so much unpaid labour. With the development of the process,
which expresses itself in a drop in the rate of profit, the mass of
surplus-value thus produced swells to immense dimensions. Now comes the second
act of the process. The entire mass of commodities, <i>i.e. </i>, the total
product, including the portion which replaces the constant and variable
capital, and that representing surplus-value, must be sold. If this is not
done, or done only in part, or only at prices below the prices of production,
the labourer has been indeed exploited, but his exploitation is not realised as
such for the capitalist, and this can be bound up with a total or partial
failure to realise the surplus-value pressed out of him, indeed even with the
partial or total loss of the capital. The conditions of direct exploitation,
and those of realising it, are not identical. They diverge not only in place
and time, but also logically. The first are only limited by the productive
power of society, the latter by the proportional relation of the various
branches of production and the consumer power of society. But this last-named
is not determined either by the absolute productive power, or by the absolute
consumer power, but by the consumer power based on antagonistic conditions of
distribution, which reduce the consumption of the bulk of society to a minimum
varying within more or less narrow limits. It is furthermore restricted by the
tendency to accumulate, the drive to expand capital and produce surplus-value
on an extended scale. This is law for capitalist production, imposed by
incessant revolutions in the methods of production themselves, by the
depreciation of existing capital always bound up with them, by the general
competitive struggle and the need to improve production and expand its scale
merely as a means of self-preservation and under penalty of ruin. The market
must, therefore, be continually extended, so that its interrelations and the
conditions regulating them assume more and more the form of a natural law
working independently of the producer, and become ever more uncontrollable.
This internal contradiction seeks to resolve itself through expansion of the
outlying field of production. But the more productiveness develops, the more it
finds itself at variance with the narrow basis on which the conditions of
consumption rest. It is no contradiction at all on this self-contradictory
basis that there should be an excess of capital simultaneously with a growing
surplus of population. For while a combination of these two would, indeed,
increase the mass of produced surplus-value, it would at the same time
intensify the contradiction between the conditions under which this
surplus-value is produced and those under which it is realised.</p>
<p>If a certain rate of profit is given, the mass of profit will always depend
on the magnitude of the advanced capital. The accumulation, however, is then
determined by that portion of this mass which is reconverted into capital. As
for this portion, being equal to the profit minus the revenue consumed by the
capitalists, it will depend not merely on the value of this mass, but also on
the cheapness of the commodities which the capitalist can buy with it,
commodities which pass partly into his consumption, his revenue, and partly
into his constant capital. (Wages are here assumed to be given.)</p>
<p>The mass of capital set in motion by the labourer, whose value he preserves
by his labour and reproduces in his product, is quite different from the value
which he adds to it. If the mass of the capital = 1,000 and the added labour =
100, the reproduced capital = 1,100. If the mass = 100 and the added labour =
20, the reproduced capital = 120. In the first case the rate of profit = 10%,
in the second = 20%. And yet more can be accumulated out of 100 than out of 20.
And thus the river of capital rolls on (aside from its depreciation through
increase of the productiveness), or its accumulation does, not in proportion to
the rate of profit, but in proportion to the impetus it already possesses. So
far as it is based on a high rate of surplus-value, a high rate of profit is
possible when the working-day is very long, although labour is not highly
productive. It is possible, because the wants of the labourers are very small,
hence average wages very low, although the labour itself is unproductive. The
low wages will correspond to the labourers' lack of energy. Capital then
accumulates slowly, in spite of the high rate of profit. Population is stagnant
and the working-time which the product costs, is great, while the wages paid to
the labourer etare small.</p>
<p>The rate of profit does not sink because the labourer is exploited any less,
but because generally less labour is employed in proportion to the employed
capital.</p>
<p>If, as shown, a falling rate of profit is bound up with an increase in the
mass of profit, a larger portion of the annual product of labour is
appropriated by the capitalist under the category of capital (as a replacement
for consumed capital) and a relatively smaller portion under the category of
profit. Hence the fantastic idea of priest Chalmers, [Th. Chalmers, <i>On
Political Economy in Connexion with the Moral State and Moral Prospects of
Society,</i> Second edition, Glasgow, 1832, p. <i>88. — Ed</i>] that
the less of the annual product is expended by capitalists as capital, the
greater the profits they pocket. In which case the state church comes to their
assistance, to care for the consumption of the greater part of the
surplus-product, rather than having it used as capital. The preacher confounds
cause with effect. Furthermore, the mass of profit increases in spite of its
slower rate with the growth of the invested capital. However, this requires a
simultaneous concentration of capital, since the conditions of production then
demand employment of capital on a larger scale. It also requires its
centralisation, <i>i.e. </i>, the swallowing up of the small capitalists by
the big and their deprivation of capital. It is again but an instance of
separating — raised to the second power — the conditions of
production from the producers to whose number these small capitalists still
belong, since their own labour continues to play a role in their case. The
labour of a capitalist stands altogether in inverse proportion to the size of
his capital, <i>i.e. </i>, to the degree in which he is a capitalist. It is
this same severance of the conditions of production, on the one hand, from the
producers, on the other, that forms the conception of capital. It begins with
primitive accumulation (Buch I, Kap. XXIV [English edition: Part <i>VIII.
— Ed.</i>]), appears as a permanent process in the accumulation and
concentration of capital, and expresses itself finally as centralisation of
existing capitals in a few hands and a deprivation of many of their capital (to
which expropriation is now changed). This process would soon bring about the
collapse of capitalist production if it were not for counteracting tendencies,
which have a continuous decentralising effect alongside the centripetal one.</p>
<h4>II. Conflict Between Expansion Of Production And Production Of
Surplus-Value</h4>
<p>The development of the social productiveness of labour is manifested in two
ways: first, in the magnitude of the already produced productive forces, the
value and mass of the conditions of production under which new production is
carried on, and in the absolute magnitude of the already accumulated productive
capital; secondly, in the relative smallness of the portion of total capital
laid out in wages, <i>i.e. </i>, in the relatively small quantity of living
labour required for the reproduction and self-expansion of a given capital, for
mass production. This also implies concentration of capital.</p>
<p>In relation to employed labour-power the development of the productivity
again reveals itself in two ways: First, in the increase of surplus-labour,
<i>i.e. </i>, the reduction of the necessary labour-time required for the
reproduction of labour-power. Secondly, in the decrease of the quantity of
labour-power (the number of labourers) generally employed to set in motion a
given capital.</p>
<p>The two movements not only go hand in hand, but mutually influence one
another and are phenomena in which the same law expresses itself. Yet they
affect the rate of profit in opposite ways. The total mass of profit is equal
to the total mass of surplus-value, the rate of profit = s/C =
surplus-value/advanced total capital. The surplus-value, however, as a total,
is determined first by its rate, and second by the mass of labour
simultaneously employed at this rate, or, what amounts to the same, by the
magnitude of the variable capital. One of these factors, the rate of
surplus-value, rises, and the other, the number of labourers, falls (relatively
or absolutely). Inasmuch as the development of the productive forces reduces
the paid portion of employed labour, it raises the surplus-value, because it
raises its rate; but inasmuch as it reduces the total mass of labour employed
by a given capital, it reduces the factor of the number by which the rate of
surplus-value is multiplied to obtain its mass. Two labourers, each working 12
hours daily, cannot produce the same mass of surplus-value as 24 who work only
2 hours, even if they could live on air and hence did not have to work for
themselves at all. In this respect, then, the compensation of the reduced
number of labourers by intensifying the degree of exploitation has certain
insurmountable limits. It may, for this reason, well check the fall in the rate
of profit, but cannot prevent it altogether.</p>
<p>With the development of the capitalist mode of production, therefore, the
rate of profit falls, while its mass increases with the growing mass of the
capital employed. Given the rate, the absolute increase in the mass of capital
depends on its existing magnitude. But, on the other hand, if this magnitude is
given, the proportion of its growth, <i>i.e. </i>, the rate of its increment,
depends on the rate of profit. The increase in the productiveness (which,
moreover, we repeat, always goes hand in hand with a depreciation of the
available capital) can directly only increase the value of the existing capital
if by raising the rate of profit it increases that portion of the value of the
annual product which is reconverted into capital. As concerns the productivity
of labour, this can only occur (since this productivity has nothing direct to
do with the <i>value </i>of the existing capital) by raising the relative
surplus-value, or reducing the value of the constant capital, so that the
commodities which enter either the reproduction of labour-power, or the
elements of constant capital, are cheapened. Both imply a depreciation of the
existing capital, and both go hand in hand with a reduction of the variable
capital in relation to the constant. Both cause a fall in the rate of profit,
and both slow it down. Furthermore, inasmuch as an increased rate of profit
causes a greater demand for labour, it tends to increase the working population
and thus the material, whose exploitation makes real capital out of capital.</p>
<p>Indirectly, however, the development of the productivity of labour
contributes to the increase of the value of the existing capital by increasing
the mass and variety of use-values in which the same exchange-value is
represented and which form the material substance, <i>i.e. </i>, the material
elements of capital, the material objects making up the constant capital
directly, and the variable capital at least indirectly. More products which may
be converted into capital, whatever their exchange-value, are created with the
same capital and the same labour. These products may serve to absorb additional
labour, hence also additional surplus-labour, and therefore create additional
capital. The amount of labour which a capital can command does not depend on
its value, but on the mass of raw and auxiliary materials, machinery and
elements of fixed capital and necessities of life, all of which it comprises,
whatever their value may be. As the mass of the labour employed, and thus of
surplus-labour increases, there is also a growth in the value of the reproduced
capital and in the surplus-value newly added to it.</p>
<p>These two elements embraced by the process of accumulation, however, are not
to be regarded merely as existing side by side in repose, as Ricardo does. They
contain a contradiction which manifests itself in contradictory tendencies and
phenomena. These antagonistic agencies counteract each other simultaneously.</p>
<p>Alongside the stimulants of an actual increase of the labouring population,
which spring from the increase of the portion of the total social product
serving as capital, there are agencies which create a merely relative
over-population.</p>
<p>Alongside the fall in the rate of profit mass of capitals grows, and hand in
hand with this there occurs a depreciation of existing capitals which checks
the fall and gives an accelerating motion to the accumulation of
capital-values.</p>
<p>Alongside the development of productivity there develops a higher
composition of capital, <i>i.e.</i>, the relative decrease of the ratio of
variable to constant capital.</p>
<p>These different influences may at one time operate predominantly side by
side in space, and at another succeed each other in time. From time to time the
conflict of antagonistic agencies finds vent in crises. The crises are always
but momentary and forcible solutions of the existing contradictions. They are
violent eruptions which for a time restore the disturbed equilibrium.</p>
<p>The contradiction, to put it in a very general way, consists in that the
capitalist mode of production involves a tendency towards absolute development
of the productive forces, regardless of the value and surplus-value it
contains, and regardless of the social conditions under which capitalist
production takes place; while, on the other hand, its aim is to preserve the
value of the existing capital and promote its self-expansion to the highest
limit (<i>i.e.</i>, to promote an ever more rapid growth of this value). The
specific feature about it is that it uses the existing value of capital as a
means of increasing this value to the utmost. The methods by which it
accomplishes this include the fall of the rate of profit, depreciation of
existing capital, and development of the productive forces of labour at the
expense of already created productive forces.</p>
<p>The periodical depreciation of existing capital — one of the means
immanent in capitalist production to check the fall of the rate of profit and
hasten accumulation of capital-value through formation of new capital —
disturbs the given conditions, within which the process of circulation and
reproduction of capital takes place, and is therefore accompanied by sudden
stoppages and crises in the production process.</p>
<p>The decrease of variable in relation to constant capital, which goes hand in
hand with the development of the productive forces, stimulates the growth of
the labouring population, while continually creating an artificial
over-population. The accumulation of capital in terms of value is slowed down
by the falling rate of profit, to hasten still more the accumulation of
use-values, while this, in its turn, adds new momentum to accumulation in terms
of value.</p>
<p>Capitalist production seeks continually to overcome these immanent barriers,
but overcomes them only by means which again place these barriers in its way
and on a more formidable scale.</p>
<p>The <i>real barrier</i> of capitalist production is <i>capital
itself</i>. It is that capital and its self-expansion appear as the starting
and the closing point, the motive and the purpose of production; that
production is only production for <i>capital</i> and not vice versa, the
means of production are not mere means for a constant expansion of the living
process of the <i>society</i> of producers. The limits within which the
preservation and self-expansion of the value of capital resting on the
expropriation and pauperisation of the great mass of producers can alone move
— these limits come continually into conflict with the methods of
production employed by capital for its purposes, which drive towards unlimited
extension of production, towards production as an end in itself, towards
unconditional development of the social productivity of labour. The means
— unconditional development of the productive forces of society —
comes continually into conflict with the limited purpose, the self-expansion of
the existing capital. The capitalist mode of production is, for this reason, a
historical means of developing the material forces of production and creating
an appropriate world-market and is, at the same time, a continual conflict
between this its historical task and its own corresponding relations of social
production.</p>
<h4>III. Excess Capital And Excess Population</h4>
<p>A drop in the rate of profit is attended by a rise in the minimum capital
required by an individual capitalist for the productive employment of labour;
required both for its exploitation generally, and for making the consumed
labour-time suffice as the labour-time necessary for the production of the
commodities, so that it does not exceed the average social labour-time required
for the production of the commodities. Concentration increases simultaneously,
because beyond certain limits a large capital with a small rate of profit
accumulates faster than a small capital with a large rate of profit. At a
certain high point this increasing concentration in its turn causes a new fall
in the rate of profit. The mass of small dispersed capitals is thereby driven
along the adventurous road of speculation, credit frauds, stock swindles, and
crises. The so-called plethora of capital always applies essentially to a
plethora of the capital for which the fall in the rate of profit is not
compensated through the mass of profit — this is always true of newly
developing fresh offshoots of capital — or to a plethora which places
capitals incapable of action on their own at the disposal of the managers of
large enterprises in the form of credit. This plethora of capital arises from
the same causes as those which call forth relative over-population, and is,
therefore, a phenomenon supplementing the latter, although they stand at
opposite poles — unemployed capital at one pole, and unemployed worker
population at the other.</p>
<p>Over-production of capital, not of individual commodities — although
over-production of capital always includes over-production of commodities
— is therefore simply over-accumulation of capital. To appreciate what
this over-accumulation is (its closer analysis follows later), one need only
assume it to be absolute. When would over-production of capital be absolute?
Overproduction which would affect not just one or another, or a few important
spheres of production, but would be absolute in its full scope, hence would
extend to all fields of production?</p>
<p>There would be absolute over-production of capital as soon as additional
capital for purposes of capitalist production = 0. The purpose of capitalist
production, however, is self-expansion of capital, <i>i.e.</i>, appropriation
of surplus-labour, production of surplus-value, of profit. As soon as capital
would, therefore, have grown in such a ratio to the labouring population that
neither the absolute working-time supplied by this population, nor the relative
surplus working-time, could be expanded any further (this last would not be
feasible at any rate in the case when the demand for labour were so strong that
there were a tendency for wages to rise); at a point, therefore, when the
increased capital produced just as much, or even less, surplus-value than it
did before its increase, there would be absolute over-production of capital;
<i>i.e.</i>, the increased capital C + ΔC would produce no more, or
even less, profit than capital C before its expansion by ΔC. In both
cases there would be a steep and sudden fall in the general rate of profit, but
this time due to a change in the composition of capital not caused by the
development of the productive forces, but rather by a rise in the money-value
of the variable capital (because of increased wages) and the corresponding
reduction in the proportion of surplus-labour to necessary labour.</p>
<p>In reality, it would appear that a portion of the capital would lie
completely or partially idle (because it would have to crowd out some of the
active capital before it could expand its own value), and the other portion
would produce values at a lower rate of profit, owing to the pressure of
unemployed or but partly employed capital. It would be immaterial in this
respect if a part of the additional capital were to take the place of the old
capital, and the latter were to take its position in the additional capital. We
should still always have the old sum of capital on one side, and the sum of
additional capital on the other. The fall in the rate of profit would then be
accompanied by an absolute decrease in the mass of profit, since the mass of
employed labour-power could not be increased and the rate of surplus-value
raised under the conditions we had assumed, so that the mass of surplus-value
could not be increased either. And the reduced mass of profit would have to be
calculated on an increased total capital. But even if it is assumed that the
employed capital continues to self-expand at the old rate of profit, and the
mass of profit hence remains the same, this mass would still he calculated on
an increased total capital, this likewise implying a fall in the rate of
profit. If a total capital of 1,000 yielded a profit of 100, and after being
increased to 1,500 still yielded 100, then, in the second case, 1,000 would
yield only 66⅔. Self-expansion of the old capital, in the absolute
sense, would have been reduced. The capital = 1,000 would yield no more under
the new circumstances than formerly a capital = 666⅔.</p>
<p>It is evident, however, that this actual depreciation of the old capital
could not occur without a struggle, and that the additional capital ΔC
could not assume the functions of capital without a struggle. The rate of
profit would not fall under the effect of competition due to over-production of
capital. It would rather be the reverse; it would be the competitive struggle
which would begin because the fallen rate of profit and over-production of
capital originate from the same conditions. The part of ΔC in the hands
of old functioning capitalists would be allowed to remain more or less idle to
prevent a depreciation of their own original capital and not to narrow its
place in the field of production. Or they would employ it, even at a momentary
loss, to shift the need of keeping additional capital idle on newcomers and on
their competitors in general.</p>
<p>That portion of ΔC which is in new hands would seek to assume a place
for itself at the expense of the old capital, and would accomplish this in part
by forcing a portion of the old capital to lie idle. It would compel the old
capital to give up its old place and withdraw to join completely or partially
unemployed additional capital.</p>
<p>A portion of the old capital has to lie unused under all circumstances; it
has to give up its characteristic quality as capital, so far as acting as such
and producing value is concerned. The competitive struggle would decide what
part of it would be particularly affected. So long as things go well,
competition effects an operating fraternity of the capitalist class, as we have
seen in the case of the equalisation of the general rate of profit, so that
each shares in the common loot in proportion to the size of his respective
investment. But as soon as it no longer is a question of sharing profits, but
of sharing losses, everyone tries to reduce his own share to a minimum and to
shove it off upon another. The class, as such, must inevitably lose. How much
the individual capitalist must bear of the loss, <i>i.e.</i>, to what extent
he must share in it at all, is decided by strength and cunning, and competition
then becomes a fight among hostile brothers. The antagonism between each
individual capitalist's interests and those of the capitalist class as a whole,
then comes to the surface, just as previously the identity of these interests
operated in practice through competition.</p>
<p>How is this conflict settled and the conditions restored which correspond to
the "sound" operation of capitalist production? The mode of settlement is
already indicated in the very emergence of the conflict whose settlement is
under discussion. It implies the withdrawal and even the partial destruction of
capital amounting to the full value of additional capital ΔC, or at least
a part of it. Although, as the description of this conflict shows, the loss is
by no means equally distributed among individual capitals, its distribution
being rather decided through a competitive struggle in which the loss is
distributed in very different proportions and forms, depending on special
advantages or previously captured positions, so that one capital is left
unused, another is destroyed, and a third suffers but a relative loss, or is
just temporarily depreciated, etc.</p>
<p>But the equilibrium would be restored under all circumstances through the
withdrawal or even the destruction of more or less capital. This would extend
partly to the material substance of capital, <i>i.e.</i>, a part of the means
of production, of fixed and circulating capital, would not operate, not act as
capital; some of the operating establishments would then be brought to a
standstill. Although, in this respect, time attacks and worsens all means of
production (except land), the stoppage would in reality cause far greater
damage to the means of production. However, the main effect in this case would
be that these means of production would cease to function as such, that their
function as means of production would be disturbed for a shorter or longer
period.</p>
<p>The main damage, and that of the most acute nature, would occur in respect
to capital, and in so far as the latter possesses the characteristic of value
it would occur in respect to the <i>values</i> of capitals. That portion of
the value of a capital which exists only in the form of claims on prospective
shares of surplus-value, <i>i.e.</i>, profit, in fact in the form of
promissory notes on production in various forms, is immediately depreciated by
the reduction of the receipts on which it is calculated. A part of the gold and
silver lies unused, <i>i.e.</i>, does not function as capital. Part of the
commodities on the market can complete their process of circulation and
reproduction only through an immense contraction of their prices, hence through
a depreciation of the capital which they represent. The elements of fixed
capital are depreciated to a greater or lesser degree in just the same way. It
must be added that definite, presupposed, price relations govern the process of
reproduction, so that the latter is halted and thrown into confusion by a
general drop in prices. This confusion and stagnation paralyses the function of
money as a medium of payment, whose development is geared to the development of
capital and is based on those presupposed price relations. The chain of payment
obligations due at specific dates is broken in a hundred places. The confusion
is augmented by the attendant collapse of the credit system, which develops
simultaneously with capital, and leads to violent and acute crises, to sudden
and forcible depreciations, to the actual stagnation and disruption of the
process of reproduction, and thus to a real falling off in reproduction.</p>
<p>But there would have been still other agencies at work at the same time. The
stagnation of production would have laid off a part of the working-class and
would thereby have placed the employed part in a situation, where it would have
to submit to a reduction of wages even below the average. This has the very
same effect on capital as an increase of the relative or absolute surplus-value
at average wages would have had. Prosperity would have led to more marriages
among labourers and reduced the decimation of offspring. While implying a real
increase in population, this does not signify an increase in the actual working
population. But it affects the relations of the labourer to capital in the same
way as an increase of the number of actually working labourers would have
affected them. On the other hand, the fall in prices and the competitive
struggle would have driven every capitalist to lower the individual value of
his total product below its general value by means of new machines, new and
improved working methods, new combinations, <i>i.e.</i>, to increase the
productivity of a given quantity of labour, to lower the proportion of variable
to constant capital, and thereby to release some labourers; in short, to create
an artificial over-population. Ultimately, the depreciation of the elements of
constant capital would itself tend to raise the rate of profit. The mass of
employed constant capital would have increased in relation to variable, but its
value could have fallen. The ensuing stagnation of production would have
prepared — within capitalistic limits — a subsequent expansion of
production.</p>
<p>And thus the cycle would run its course anew. Part of the capital,
depreciated by its functional stagnation, would recover its old value. For the
rest, the same vicious circle would be described once more under expanded
conditions of production, with an expanded market and increased productive
forces.</p>
<p>However, even under the extreme conditions assumed by us this absolute
over-production of capital is not absolute over-production, not absolute
over-production of means of production. It is over-production of means of
production only in so far as the latter serve <i>as capital,</i> and
consequently include a self-expansion of value, must produce an additional
value in proportion to the increased mass.</p>
<p>Yet it would still be over-production, because capital would be unable to
exploit labour to the degree required by a "sound", "normal" development of the
process of capitalist production, to a degree which would at least increase the
mass of profit along with the growing mass of the employed capital; to a degree
which would, therefore, prevent the rate of profit from falling as much as the
capital grows, or even more rapidly.</p>
<p>Over-production of capital is never anything more than over-production of
means of production — of means of labour and necessities of life —
which may serve as capital, <i>i.e.</i>, may serve to exploit labour at a
given degree of exploitation; a fall in the intensity of exploitation below a
certain point, however, calls forth disturbances, and stoppages in the
capitalist production process, crises, and destruction of capital. It is no
contradiction that this over-production of capital is accompanied by more or
less considerable relative over-population. The circumstances which increased
the productiveness of labour, augmented the mass of produced commodities,
expanded markets, accelerated accumulation of capital both in terms of its mass
and its value, and lowered the rate of profit — these same circumstances
have also created, and continuously create, a relative overpopulation, an
over-population of labourers not employed by the surplus-capital owing to the
low degree of exploitation at which alone they could be employed, or at least
owing to the low rate of profit which they would yield at the given degree of
exploitation.</p>
<p>If capital is sent abroad, this is not done because it absolutely could not
be applied at home, but because it can be employed at a higher rate of profit
in a foreign country. But such capital is absolute excess capital for the
employed labouring population and for the home country in general. It exists as
such alongside the relative over-population, and this is an illustration of how
both of them exist side by side, and mutually influence one another.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a fall in the rate of profit connected with accumulation
necessarily calls forth a competitive struggle. Compensation of a fall in the
rate of profit by a rise in the mass of profit applies only to the total social
capital and to the big, firmly placed capitalists. The new additional capital
operating independently does not enjoy any such compensating conditions. It
must still win them, and so it is that a fall in the rate of profit calls forth
a competitive struggle among capitalists, not vice versa. To be sure, the
competitive struggle is accompanied by a temporary rise in wages and a
resultant further temporary fall of the rate of profit. The same occurs when
there is an over-production of commodities, when markets are overstocked. Since
the aim of capital is not to minister to certain wants, but to produce profit,
and since it accomplishes this purpose by methods which adapt the mass of
production to the scale of production, not vice versa, a rift must continually
ensue between the limited dimensions of consumption under capitalism and a
production which forever tends to exceed this immanent barrier. Furthermore,
capital consists of commodities, and therefore over-production of capital
implies over-production of commodities. Hence the peculiar phenomenon of
economists who deny over-production of commodities, admitting over-production
of capital. To say that there is no general over-production, but rather a
disproportion within the various branches of production, is no more than to say
that under capitalist production the proportionality of the individual branches
of production springs as a continual process from disproportionality, because
the cohesion of the aggregate production imposes itself as a blind law upon the
agents of production, and not as a law which, being understood and hence
controlled by their common mind, brings the productive process under their
joint control. It amounts furthermore to demanding that countries in which
capitalist production is not developed, should consume and produce at a rate
which suits the countries with capitalist production. If it is said that
over-production is only relative, this is quite correct; but the entire
capitalist mode of production is only a relative one, whose barriers are not
absolute. They are absolute only for this mode, <i>i.e.</i>, on its basis.
How could there otherwise be a shortage of demand for the very commodities
which the mass of the people lack, and how would it be possible for this demand
to be sought abroad, in foreign markets, to pay the labourers at home the
average amount of necessities of life? This is possible only because in this
specific capitalist interrelation the surplus-product assumes a form in which
its owner cannot offer it for consumption, unless it first reconverts itself
into capital for him. If it is finally said that the capitalists have only to
exchange and consume their commodities among themselves, then the entire nature
of the capitalist mode of production is lost sight of; and also forgotten is
the fact that it is a matter of expanding the value of the capital, not
consuming it. In short, all these objections to the obvious phenomena of
over-production (phenomena which pay no heed to these objections) amount to the
contention that the barriers of <i>capitalist</i> production are not barriers
of <i>production generally,</i> and therefore not barriers of this specific,
capitalist mode of production. The contradiction of the capitalist mode of
production, however, lies precisely in its tendency towards an absolute
development of the productive forces, which continually come into conflict with
the specific <i>conditions</i> of production in which capital moves, and
alone can move.</p>
<p>There are not too many necessities of life produced, in proportion to the
existing population. Quite the reverse. Too little is produced to decently and
humanely satisfy the wants of the great mass.</p>
<p>There are not too many means of production produced to employ the
able-bodied portion of the population. Quite the reverse. In the first place,
too large a portion of the produced population is not really capable of
working, and is through force of circumstances made dependent on exploiting the
labour of others, or on labour which can pass under this name only under a
miserable mode of production. In the second place, not enough means of
production are produced to permit the employment of the entire able-bodied
population under the most productive conditions, so that their absolute working
period could be shortened by the mass and effectiveness of the constant capital
employed during working-hours.</p>
<p>On the other hand, too many means of labour and necessities of life are
produced at times to permit of their serving as means for the exploitation of
labourers at a certain rate of profit. Too many commodities are produced to
permit of a realisation and conversion into new capital of the value and
surplus-value contained in them under the conditions of distribution and
consumption peculiar to capitalist production, <i>i.e.</i>, too many to
permit of the consummation of this process without constantly recurring
explosions.</p>
<p>Not too much wealth is produced. But at times too much wealth is produced in
its capitalistic, self-contradictory forms.</p>
<p>The limitations of the capitalist mode of production come to the surface:</p>
<p>1) In that the development of the productivity of labour creates out of the
falling rate of profit a law which at a certain point comes into antagonistic
conflict with this development and must be overcome constantly through
crises.</p>
<p>2) In that the expansion or contraction of production are determined by the
appropriation of unpaid labour and the proportion of this unpaid labour to
materialised labour in general, or, to speak the language of the capitalists,
by profit and the proportion of this profit to the employed capital, thus by a
definite rate of profit, rather than the relation of production to social
requirements, <i>i.e.</i>, to the requirements of' socially developed human
beings. It is for this reason that the capitalist mode of production meets with
barriers at a certain expanded stage of production which, if viewed from the
other premise, would reversely have been altogether inadequate. It comes to a
standstill at a point fixed by the production and realisation of profit, and
not the satisfaction of requirements.</p>
<p>If the rate of profit falls, there follows, on the one hand, an exertion of
capital in order that the individual capitalists, through improved methods,
etc., may depress the value of their individual commodity below the social
average value and thereby realise an extra profit at the prevailing
market-price. On the other hand, there appears swindling and a general
promotion of swindling by recourse to frenzied ventures with new methods of
production, new investments of capital, new adventures, all for the sake of
securing a shred of extra profit which is independent of the general average
and rises above it.</p>
<p>The rate of profit, <i>i.e.</i>, the relative increment of capital, is
above all important to all new offshoots of capital seeking to find an
independent place for themselves. And as soon as formation of capital were to
fall into the hands of a few established big capitals, for which the mass of
profit compensates for the falling rate of profit, the vital flame of
production would be altogether extinguished. It would die out. The rate of
profit is the motive power of capitalist production. Things are produced only
so long as they can be produced with a profit. Hence the concern of the English
economists over the decline of the rate of profit. The fact that the bare
possibility of this happening should worry Ricardo, shows his profound
understanding of the conditions of capitalist production. It is that which is
held against him, it is his unconcern about "human beings," and his having an
eye solely for the development of the productive forces, whatever the cost in
human beings and capital-<i>values</i> — it is precisely that which is
the important thing about him. Development of the productive forces of social
labour is the historical task and justification of capital. This is just the
way in which it unconsciously creates the material requirements of a higher
mode of production. What worries Ricardo is the fact that the rate of profit,
the stimulating principle of capitalist production, the fundamental premise and
driving force of accumulation, should be endangered by the development of
production itself. And here the quantitative proportion means everything. There
is, indeed, something deeper behind it, of which he is only vaguely aware. It
comes to the surface here in a purely economic way — <i>i.e.</i>, from
the bourgeois point of view, within the limitations of capitalist
understanding, from the standpoint of capitalist production itself — that
it has its barrier, that it is relative, that it is not an absolute, but only a
historical mode of production corresponding to a definite limited epoch in the
development of the material requirements of production.</p>
<h4>IV. Supplementary Remarks</h4>
<p>Since the development of the productivity of labour proceeds very
disproportionately in the various lines of industry, and not only
disproportionately in degree but frequently also in opposite directions, it
follows that the mass of average profit (= surplus-value) must be substantially
below the level one would naturally expect after the development of the
productiveness in the most advanced branches of industry. The fact that the
development of the productivity in different lines of industry proceeds at
substantially different rates and frequently even in opposite directions, is
not due merely to the anarchy of competition and the peculiarity of the
bourgeois mode of production. Productivity of labour is also bound up with
natural conditions, which frequently become less productive as productivity
grows — inasmuch as the latter depends on social conditions. Hence the
opposite movements in these different spheres — progress here, and
retrogression there. Consider the mere influence of the seasons, for instance,
on which the bulk of raw materials depends for its mass, the exhaustion of
forest lands, coal and iron mines, etc.</p>
<p>While the circulating part of constant capital, such as raw materials, etc.,
continually increases its mass in proportion to the productivity of labour,
this is not the case with fixed capital, such as buildings, machinery, and
lighting and heating facilities, etc. Although in absolute terms a machine
becomes dearer with the growth of its bodily mass, it becomes relatively
cheaper. If five labourers produce ten times as much of a commodity as before,
this does not increase the outlay for fixed capital ten-fold; although the
value of this part of constant capital increases with the development of the
productiveness, it does not by any means increase in the same proportion. We
have frequently pointed out the difference in the ratio of constant to variable
capital as expressed in the fall of the rate of profit, and the difference in
the same ratio as expressed in relation to the individual commodity and its
price with the development of the productivity of labour.</p>
<p>[The value of a commodity is determined by the total labour-time of past and
living labour incorporated in it. The increase in labour productivity consists
precisely in that the share of living labour is reduced while that of past
labour is increased, but in such a way that the total quantity of labour
incorporated in that commodity declines; in such a way, therefore, that living
labour decreases more than past labour increases. The past labour contained in
the value of a commodity — the constant part of capital — consists
partly of the wear and tear of fixed, partly of circulating, constant capital
entirely consumed by that commodity, such as raw and auxiliary materials. The
portion of value deriving from raw and auxiliary materials must decrease with
the increased productivity of labour, because with regard to these materials
the productivity expresses itself precisely by reducing their value. On the
other hand, it is most characteristic of rising labour productivity that the
fixed part of constant capital is strongly augmented, and with it that portion
of its value which is transferred by wear and tear to the commodities. For a
new method of production to represent a real increase in productivity, it must
transfer a smaller additional portion of the value of fixed capital to each
unit of the commodity in wear and tear than the portion of value deducted from
it through the saving in living labour; in short, it must reduce the value of
the commodity. It must obviously do so even if, as it occurs in some cases, an
additional value goes into the value of the commodity for more or dearer raw or
auxiliary materials over and above the additional portion for wear and tear of
the fixed capital. All additions to the value must be more than offset by the
reduction in value resulting from the decrease in living labour.</p>
<p>This reduction of the total quantity of labour going into a commodity seems,
accordingly, to be the essential criterion of increased productivity of labour,
no matter under what social conditions production is carried on. Productivity
of labour, indeed, would always be measured by this standard in a society, in
which producers regulate their production according to a preconceived plan, or
even under simple commodity-production. But how does the matter stand under
capitalist production?</p>
<p>Suppose, a certain line of capitalist industry produces a normal unit of its
commodity under the following conditions: The wear and tear of fixed capital
amounts to ½ shilling per piece; raw and auxiliary materials go into it to the
amount of 17½ shillings per piece; wages, 2 shillings; and surplus-value, 2
shillings at a rate of surplus-value of 100%. Total value = 22 shillings. We
assume for the sake of simplicity that the capital in this line of production
has the average composition of social capital, so that the price of production
of the commodity is identical with its value, and the profit of the capitalist
with the created surplus-value. Then the cost-price of the commodity = ½ + 17½
+ 2 = 20s., the average rate of profit 2/20 = 10%, and the price of production
per piece of the commodity, like its value = 22s.</p>
<p>Suppose a machine is invented which reduces by half the living labour
required per piece of the commodity, but trebles that portion of its value
accounted for by the wear and tear of the fixed capital. In that case, the
calculation is: Wear and tear = 1½ s., raw and auxiliary materials, as before,
17½s., wages, 1s., surplus-value 1s., total 21s. The commodity then falls 1s.
in value; the new machine has certainly increased the productivity of labour.
But the capitalist sees the matter as follows: his cost-price is now 1½s. for
wear, 17½s. for raw and auxiliary materials, 1s. for wages, total 20s., as
before. Since the rate of profit is not immediately altered by the new machine,
he will receive 10% over his cost-price, that is, 2s. The price of production,
then, remains unaltered = 22s., but is 1s. above the value. For a society
producing under capitalist conditions the commodity has not cheapened. The new
machine is <i>no</i> improvement for it. The capitalist is, therefore, not
interested in introducing it. And since its introduction would make his
present, not as yet worn-out, machinery simply worthless, would turn it into
scrap-iron, hence would cause a positive loss, he takes good care not to commit
this, what is for him a utopian, mistake.</p>
<p>The law of increased productivity of labour is not, therefore, absolutely
valid for capital. So far as capital is concerned, productiveness does not
increase through a saving in living labour in general, but only through a
saving in the <i>paid</i> portion of living labour, as compared to labour
expended in the past, as we have already indicated in passing in Book I (Kap.
XI II, 2, 5. 409/398). [English edition: Ch. XV, 2<i>. — Ed.</i>] Here
the capitalist mode of production is beset with another contradiction. Its
historical mission is unconstrained development in geometrical progression of
the productivity of human labour. It goes back on its mission whenever, as
here, it checks the development of productivity. It thus demonstrates again
that it is becoming senile and that it is more and more outlived.] <a href="#1" id="1a"><sup class="enote">[1]</sup></a></p>
<hr class="section"/>
<p>Under competition, the increasing minimum of capital required with the
increase in productivity for the successful operation of an independent
industrial establishment, assumes the following aspect: As soon as the new,
more expensive equipment has become universally established, smaller capitals
are henceforth excluded from this industry. Smaller capitals can carry on
independently in the various spheres of industry only in the infancy of
mechanical inventions. Very large undertakings, such as railways, on the other
hand, which have an unusually high proportion of constant capital, do not yield
the average rate of profit, but only a portion of it, only an interest.
Otherwise the general rate of profit would have fallen still lower. But this
offers direct employment to large concentrations of capital in the form of
stocks.</p>
<p>Growth of capital, hence accumulation of capital, does not imply a fall in
the rate of profit, unless it is accompanied by the aforementioned changes in
the proportion of the organic constituents of capital. Now it so happens that
in spite of the constant daily revolutions in the mode of production, now this
and now that larger or smaller portion of the total capital continues to
accumulate for certain periods on the basis of a given average proportion of
those constituents, so that there is no organic change with its growth, and
consequently no cause for a fall in the rate of profit. This constant expansion
of capital, hence also an expansion of production, on the basis of the old
method of production which goes quietly on while new methods are already being
introduced at its side, is another reason, why the rate of profit does not
decline as much as the total capital of society grows.</p>
<p>The increase in the absolute number of labourers does not occur in all
branches of production, and not uniformly in all, in spite of the relative
decrease of variable capital laid out in wages. In agriculture, the decrease of
the element of living labour may be absolute.</p>
<p>At any rate, it is but a requirement of the capitalist mode of production
that the number of wage-workers should increase absolutely, in spite of its
relative decrease. Labour-power becomes redundant for it as soon as it is no
longer necessary to employ it for 12 to 15 hours daily. A development of
productive forces which would diminish the absolute number of labourers,
<i>i.e.</i>, enable the entire nation to accomplish its total production in a
shorter time span, would cause a revolution, because it would put the bulk of
the population out of the running. This is another manifestation of the
specific barrier of capitalist production, showing also that capitalist
production is by no means an absolute form for the development of the
productive forces and for the creation of wealth, but rather that at a certain
point it comes into collision with this development. This collision appears
partly in periodical crises, which arise from the circumstance that now this
and now that portion of the labouring population becomes redundant under its
old mode of employment. The limit of capitalist production is the excess time
of the labourers. The absolute spare time gained by society does not concern
it. The development of productivity concerns it only in so far as it increases
the surplus labour-time of the working-class, not because it decreases the
labour-time for material production in general. It moves thus in a
contradiction.</p>
<p>We have seen that the growing accumulation of capital implies its growing
concentration. Thus grows the power of capital, the alienation of the
conditions of social production personified in the capitalist from the real
producers. Capital comes more and more to the fore as a social power, whose
agent is the capitalist. This social power no longer stands in any possible
relation to that which the labour of a single individual can create. It becomes
an alienated, independent, social power, which stands opposed to society as an
object, and as an object that is the capitalist's source of power. The
contradiction between the general social power into which capital develops, on
the one hand, and the private power of the individual capitalists over these
social conditions of production, on the other, becomes ever more
irreconcilable, and yet contains the solution of the problem, because it
implies at the same time the transformation of the conditions of production
into general, common, social, conditions. This transformation stems from the
development of the productive forces under capitalist production, and from the
ways and means by which this development takes place.</p>
<hr class="section"/>
<p>No capitalist ever voluntarily introduces a new method of production, no
matter how much more productive it may be, and how much it may increase the
rate of surplus-value, so long as it reduces the rate of profit. Yet every such
new method of production cheapens the commodities. Hence, the capitalist sells
them originally above their prices of production, or, perhaps, above their
value. He pockets the difference between their costs of production and the
market-prices of the same commodities produced at higher costs of production.
He can do this, because the average labour-time required socially for the
production of these latter commodities is higher than the labour-time required
for the new methods of production. His method of production stands above the
social average. But competition makes it general and subject to the general
law. There follows a fall in the rate of profit — perhaps first in this
sphere of production, and eventually it achieves a balance with the rest
— which is, therefore, wholly independent of the will of the
capitalist.</p>
<p>It is still to be added to this point, that this same law also governs those
spheres of production, whose product passes neither directly nor indirectly
into the consumption of the labourers, or into the conditions under which their
necessities are produced; it applies, therefore, also to those spheres of
production, in which there is no cheapening of commodities to increase the
relative surplus-value or cheapen labour-power. (At any rate, a cheapening of
constant capital in all these lines may increase the rate of profit, with the
exploitation of labour remaining the same.) As soon as the new production
method begins to spread, and thereby to furnish tangible proof that these
commodities can actually be produced more cheaply, the capitalists working with
the old methods of production must sell their product below its full price of
production, because the value of this commodity has fallen, and because the
labour-time required by them to produce it is greater than the social average.
In one word — and this appears as an effect of competition — these
capitalists must also introduce the new method of production, in which the
proportion of variable to constant capital has been reduced.</p>
<p>All the circumstances which lead to the use of machinery cheapening the
price of a commodity produced by it, come down in the last analysis to a
reduction of the quantity of labour absorbed by a single piece of the
commodity; and secondly, to a reduction in the wear-and-tear portion of the
machinery, whose value goes into a single piece of the commodity. The less
rapid the wear of machinery, the more the commodities over which it is
distributed, and the more living labour it replaces before its term of
reproduction arrives. In both cases the quantity and value of the fixed
constant capital increase in relation to the variable.</p>
<p class="indentb">"All other things being equal, the power of a nation to save
from its profits varies with the rate of profits: is great when they are high,
less, when low; but as the rate of profits declines, all other things do not
remain equal.... A low rate of profits is ordinarily accompanied by a rapid
rate of accumulation, relatively to the numbers of the people, as in England
... a high rate of profit by a slower rate of accumulation, relatively to the
numbers of the people. Examples: Poland, Russia, India, etc." (Richard Jones,
<i>An Introductory Lecture on Political Economy,</i> London, 1833, p. 50
ff.)</p>
<p>Jones emphasises correctly that in spite of the falling rate of profit the
inducements and faculties to accumulate are augmented; first, on account of the
growing relative overpopulation; second, because the growing productivity of
labour is accompanied by an increase in the mass of use-values represented by
the same exchange-value, hence in the material elements of capital; third,
because the branches of production become more varied; fourth, due to the
development of the credit system, the stock companies, etc., and the resultant
case of converting money into capital without becoming an industrial
capitalist; fifth, because the wants and the greed for wealth increase; and,
sixth, because the mass of investments in fixed capital grows, etc.</p>
<hr class="section"/>
<p>Three cardinal facts of capitalist production:</p>
<p>1) Concentration of means of production in few hands, whereby they cease to
appear as the property of the immediate labourers and turn into social
production capacities. Even if initially they are the private property of
capitalists. These are the trustees of bourgeois society, but they pocket all
the proceeds of this trusteeship.</p>
<p>2) Organisation of labour itself into social labour: through co-operation,
division of labour, and the uniting of labour with the natural sciences.</p>
<p>In these two senses, the capitalist mode of production abolishes private
property and private labour, even though in contradictory forms.</p>
<p>3) Creation of the world-market.</p>
<p>The stupendous productivity developing under the capitalist mode of
production relative to population, and the increase, if not in the same
proportion, of capital-values (not just of their material substance), which
grow much more rapidly than the population, contradict the basis, which
constantly narrows in relation to the expanding wealth, and for which all this
immense productiveness works. They also contradict the conditions under which
this swelling capital augments its value. Hence the crises.</p>

Revenues and their Sources</p>
<h1>Chapter 49. Concerning the Analysis of the Process of Production</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>For the purposes of the following analysis we may leave out of consideration
the distinction between price of production and value, since this distinction
disappears altogether when, as here, the value of the total annual product of
labour is considered, i.e., the product of the total social capital.</p>
<p>Profit (profit of enterprise plus interest) and rent are nothing but
peculiar forms assumed by particular parts of the surplus-value of commodities.
The magnitude of surplus-value is the limit of the total size of the parts into
which it may be divided. Average profit plus rent are, therefore, equal to the
surplus-value. It is possible for part of the surplus-labour, and thus
surplus-value, contained in the commodities, not to take part directly in the
equalisation of an average profit, so that part of the commodity-value is not
expressed at all in its price. But first, this is balanced either by the fact
that the rate of profit increases, when the commodities sold below their value
form an element of the constant capital, or by profit and rent being represented
by a larger product, when commodities sold below their value enter into the
portion of value consumed as revenue in the form of articles for individual
consumption. Secondly, this is eliminated in the average movement. At any rate,
even if a portion of surplus-value not expressed in the price of the commodity
is lost for the price formation, the sum of average profit plus rent in its
normal form can never be larger than the total surplus-value, although it may be
smaller. Its normal form presupposes wages corresponding to the value of
labour-power. Even monopoly rent, in so far as it is not a deduction from wages,
i.e., does not constitute a special category, must always indirectly be a part
of the surplus-value. If it is not part of the price excess above the price of
production of the commodity itself, of which it is a constituent part (as in
differential rent), or an excess portion of the surplus-value of the commodity
itself, of which it is a constituent part, above that portion of its own
surplus-value measured by the average profit (as in absolute rent), it is at
least part of the surplus-value of other commodities, i.e., of commodities which
are exchanged for this commodity having a monopoly price. The sum of average
profit plus ground-rent can never be greater than the magnitude of which they
are components and which exists before this division. It is therefore immaterial
for our discussion whether the entire surplus-value of the commodities, i.e.,
all the surplus-labour contained in the commodities, is realised in their price
or not. The surplus-labour is not entirely realised if only for the reason that
due to a continual change in the amount of labour socially necessary to produce
a certain commodity, resulting from the constant change in the productiveness of
labour, some commodities are always produced under abnormal conditions and must,
therefore, be sold below their individual value. At any rate, profit plus rent
equal the total realised surplus-value (surplus-labour), and for purposes of
this discussion the realised surplus-value may be equated to all surplus-value;
for profit and rent are realised surplus-value, or, generally speaking, the
surplus-value which passes into the prices of commodities, thus in practice all
the surplus-value forming a constituent part of this price.</p>
<p>On the other hand, wages, which form the third specific form of revenue, are
always equal to the variable component part of capital, i.e., the component part
which is laid out in purchasing living labour-power, paying labourers rather
than in means of labour. (The labour which is paid in the expenditure of revenue
is itself paid in wages, profit, or rent, and therefore does not form any value
portion of commodities by which it is paid. Hence it is not considered in the
analysis of commodity-value and of the component parts into which it is
divided.) It is the materialisation of that portion of the total working-day of
the labourer in which the value of variable capital and thus the price of labour
is reproduced; that portion of commodity-value in which the labourer reproduces
the value of his own labour-power, or the price of his labour. The total
working-day of the labourer is divided into two parts. One portion in which he
performs the amount of labour necessary to reproduce the value of his own means
of subsistence; the paid portion of his total labour, the portion necessary for
his own maintenance and reproduction. The entire remaining portion of the
working-day, the entire excess quantity of labour performed above the value of
the labour realised in his wages, is surplus-labour, unpaid labour, represented
in the surplus-value of his total commodity-production (and thus in an excess
quantity of commodities), surplus-value which in turn is divided into
differently named parts, into profit (profit of enterprise plus interest) and
rent.</p>
<p>The entire value portion of commodities, then, in which the total labour of
the labourers added during one day, or one year, is realised, the total value of
the annual product, created by this labour, is divided into the value of wages,
into profit and into rent. For this total labour is divided into necessary
labour, by which the labourer creates that value portion of the product with
which he is himself paid, that is, his wages, and into unpaid surplus-labour, by
which he creates that value portion of the product which represents
surplus-value and which is later divided into profit and rent. Aside from this
labour, the labourer performs no labour, and aside from the total value of the
product, which assumes the forms of wages, profit and rent, he creates no value.
The value of the annual product, in which the new labour added by the labourer
during the year is incorporated, is equal to the wage, or the value of the
variable capital plus the surplus-value, which in turn is divided into profit
and rent.</p>
<p>The entire value portion of the annual product, then, which the labourer
creates in the course of the year, is expressed in the annual value sum of the
three revenues, the value of wages, profit, and rent. Evidently, therefore, the
value of the constant portion of capital is not reproduced in the annually
created value of product, for the wages are only equal to the value of the
variable portion of capital advanced in production, and rent and profit are only
equal to the surplus-value, the excess of value produced above the total value
of advanced capital, which equals the value of the constant capital plus the
value of the variable capital.</p>
<p>It is completely irrelevant to the problem to be solved here that a portion
of the surplus-value converted into the form of profit and rent is not consumed
as revenue, but is accumulated. That portion which is saved up as an
accumulation fund serves to create new, additional capital, but not to replace
the old capital, be it the component part of old capital laid out for
labour-power or for means of labour. We may therefore assume here, for the sake
of simplicity, that the revenue passes wholly into individual consumption. The
difficulty is two-fold. On the one hand the value of the annual product, in
which the revenues, wages, profit and rent, are consumed, contains a portion of
value equal to the portion of value of constant capital used up in it. It
contains this portion of value in addition to that portion which resolves itself
into wages and that which resolves itself into profit and rent. Its value is
therefore = wages + profit + rent + C (its constant portion of value). How can an
annually produced value, which only = wages + profit + rent, buy a product the value
of which = (wages + profit + rent) + C? How can the annually produced value buy a
product which has a higher value than its own?</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we leave aside that portion of constant capital which
did not pass over into the product, and which therefore continues to exist,
although with reduced value, as before the annual production of commodities; in
other words, temporarily leaving out of consideration the employed, but not
consumed, fixed capital, then the constant portion of advanced capital is seen
to have been wholly transferred to the new product in the form of raw and
auxiliary materials, whereas a part of the means of labour has been wholly
consumed and another part only partially, and thus only a part of its value has
been consumed in production. This entire portion of constant capital consumed in
production must be replaced in kind. Assuming all other circumstances,
particularly the productive power of labour, to remain unchanged, this portion
requires the same amount of labour for its replacement as before, i.e., it must
be replaced by an equivalent value. If not, then reproduction itself cannot take
place on the former scale. But who is obliged to perform this labour, and who
does perform it?</p>
<p>As to the first difficulty: Who is obliged to pay for the constant portion
of value contained in the product, and with what? — It is assumed that the
value of constant capital consumed in production reappears as a part of the
value of the product. This does not contradict the assumptions of the second
difficulty. For it has already been demonstrated in Book I (Kap. V) [English
edition: Ch. VII.—<i>Ed</i>.] ("The Labour Process and the Process of
Producing Surplus-Value") how the old value remains simultaneously
preserved in the product through the mere addition of new labour, although this
does not reproduce the old value and does no more than add to it, creates merely
additional value; but that this results from labour, not in so far as it is
value-creating, i.e., labour in general, but in its function as definite
productive labour. Therefore, no additional labour was necessary to preserve the
value of the constant portion in the product in which the revenue, i.e., the
entire value created during the year, is expended. But to be sure, new
additional labour is required to replace the value and use-value of constant
capital consumed during the preceding year, without the replacement of which no
reproduction at all is possible.</p>
<p>All newly added labour is represented in the value newly created during the
year, and this in turn is divided into the three revenues: wages, profit and
rent. — Thus, on the one hand, no excess social labour remains for the
replacement of the consumed constant capital, which must be replaced partially
in kind and according to its value, and partially merely according to its value
(for pure wear and tear on fixed capital). On the other hand, the value annually
created by labour, divided into wages, profit and rent, and to be expended in
this form, appears not to suffice to pay for, or buy, the constant portion of
capital, which must be contained, outside their own value, in the annual
product.</p>
<p>It is seen that the problem presented here has already been solved in the
consideration of reproduction of the total social capital — Book II, Part III.
We return to it here, in the first place, because surplus-value had not been
developed there in its revenue forms: profit (profit of enterprise plus
interest) and rent, and could not, therefore, be treated in these forms; and
then, also because precisely in the form of wages, profit and rent there is
contained an incredible blunder in analysis, which pervades all political
economy since Adam Smith.</p>
<p>We divided all capital there into two big classes: Class I, producing means
of production, and Class II, producing articles of individual consumption. The
fact that certain products may serve equally well both for personal consumption
and as means of production (a horse, grain, etc.) does not invalidate the
absolute correctness of this division in any way. It is actually no hypothesis,
but merely an expression of fact. Take the annual product of a country. One
portion of the product, whatever its ability to serve as means of production,
passes over into individual consumption. It is the product for which wages,
profit and rent are expended. This product is the product of a definite
department of the social capital. It is possible that this same capital may also
produce products belonging to Class I. In so far as it does so, it is not the
portion of this capital consumed in the products of Class II, products belonging
actually to individual consumption, which supplies the productively consumed
products belonging to Class I. This entire product II, which passes into
individual consumption, and for which therefore the revenue is spent, is the
existent form of the capital consumed in it plus the produced surplus. It is
thus the product of a capital invested solely in the production of articles of
consumption. And in the same way Department I of the annual product, which
serves as means of reproduction — raw materials and instruments of labour — whatever capacity this product may otherwise possess <i>naturaliter</i> to
serve as means of consumption, is the product of a capital invested solely in
the production of means of production. By far the greater part of products
forming constant capital exists also materially in a form in which it cannot
pass into individual consumption. In so far as this could be done, e.g., in so
far as a farmer could eat his seed-corn, butcher his draught animals, etc., the
economic barrier works the same for him as if this portion did not exist in
consumable form.</p>
<p>As already indicated, we leave out of consideration in both classes the
fixed portion of constant capital, which continues to exist in kind and, so far
as its value is concerned, independently of the annual product of both classes.</p>
<p>In Class II, for the products of which wages, profit and rent are expended,
in short, the revenues consumed, the product itself consists of three components
so far as its value is concerned. One component is equal to the value of the
constant portion of capital consumed in production; a second component is equal
to the value of the variable advanced capital laid out in wages; finally, a
third component is equal to the produced surplus-value, thus = profit + rent. The
first component of the product of Class II, the value of the constant portion of
capital, can be consumed neither by the capitalists of Class II, nor by the
labourers of this class, nor by the landowners. It forms no part of their
revenues, but must be replaced in kind and must be sold for this to occur. On
the other hand, the other two components of this product are equal to the value
of the revenues created in this class, = wages + profit + rent. In Class I the
product consists of the same constituents, as regards form. But that part which
here forms revenue, wages + profit + rent, in short, the variable portion of
capital + surplus-value, is not consumed here in the natural form of products of
this Class I, but in products of Class II. The value of the revenues of Class I
must, therefore, be consumed in that portion of products of Class II which forms
the constant capital of II to be replaced. The portion of the product of Class
II which must replace its constant capital is consumed in its natural form by
the labourers, capitalists and landlords of Class I. They spend their revenue
for this product of II. On the other hand, the product of I, to the extent that
it represents a revenue of Class I, is productively consumed in its natural form
by Class II, whose constant capital it replaces in kind. Finally, the used-up
constant portion of capital of Class I is replaced out of the very products of
this class, which consist precisely of means of labour, raw and auxiliary
materials, etc., partly through exchange by capitalists of I among themselves,
partly so that some of these capitalists can directly use their own product once
more as means of production.</p>
<p>Let us take the previous scheme (Book II, Chapter XX, II) for simple
reproduction: </p>
<table align="CENTER" border="0" width="35%"><tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;" width="60%">
I. 4,000<sub class="eq">c</sub> + 1,000<sub class="eq">v</sub> + 1,000<sub class="eq">s</sub> = 6,000<br>
II. 2,000<sub class="eq">c</sub> + 500<sub class="eq">v</sub> + 500<sub class="eq">s</sub> = 3,000</br></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;" width="10%"><span style="font-size: 24pt;">}</span></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;" width="30%"><br> = 9,000</td>
</tr></table>
<p> According to this, the producers and landlords of II consume 500<sub class="eq">v</sub> + 500<sub class="eq">s</sub> = 1,000
as revenue; 2,000<sub class="eq">c</sub> remains to be replaced.
This is consumed by the labourers, capitalists and those who draw rent from I,
whose income = 1,000<sub class="eq">v</sub> + 1,000<sub class="eq">s</sub> = 2,000. The consumed product of II is consumed as revenue by I, and the portion of the revenue of I representing an unconsumable product is consumed as constant capital by II. It remains then to account for the 4,000<sub class="eq">c</sub> of I. This is
replaced out of the product of I itself, which = 6,000, or rather = 6,000 - 2,000;
for these 2,000 have already been converted into constant capital for II. It
should be noted, of course, that these numbers have been chosen arbitrarily, and
so the relation between the value of the revenues of I and the value of the
constant capital of II appears arbitrary. It is evident, however, that so far as
the process of reproduction is normal and takes place under otherwise equal
circumstances, i.e., leaving aside the accumulation, the sum of the values of
wages, profit and rent in Class I must equal the value of the constant portion
of capital of Class II. Otherwise either Class II will not be able to replace
its constant capital, or Class I will not be able to convert its revenue from
unconsumable into consumable form.</p>
<p>Thus, the value of the annual commodity-product, just like the value of the
commodity-product produced by some particular investment of capital, and like
the value of any individual commodity, resolves itself into two component parts:
A, which replaces the value of the advanced constant capital, and B, which is
represented in the form of revenue — wages, profit and rent. The latter
component part of value, B, is counterposed to the former A, in so far as A,
under otherwise equal circumstances: 1) never assumes the form of revenue and 2)
always flows back in the form of capital, and indeed constant capital. The other
component, B, however, carries within itself, in turn, an antithesis. Profit and
rent have this in common with wages: all three are forms of revenue.
Nevertheless they differ essentially in that profit and rent represent
surplus-value, i.e., unpaid labour, whereas wages represent paid labour. The
portion of the value of the product which represents wages expended thus
replaces wages, and, under the conditions assumed by us, where reproduction
takes place on the same scale and under the same conditions, is again
reconverted into wages, flows back first as variable capital, as a component of
the capital that must be advanced anew for reproduction. This portion has a
two-fold function. It exists first in the form of capital and is exchanged as
such for labour-power. In the hands of the labourer, it is transformed into
revenue which he draws out of the sale of his labour-power, is converted as
revenue into means of subsistence and consumed. This double process is revealed
through the mediation of money circulation. The variable capital is advanced in
money, paid out as wages. This is its first function as capital. It is exchanged
for labour-power and transformed into the manifestation of this labour-power,
into labour. This is the process as regards the capitalist. Secondly, however:
with this money the labourers buy a part of the commodities produced by them,
which is measured by this money, and is consumed by them as revenue. If we
imagine the circulation of money to be eliminated, then a part of the labourer’s
product is in the hands of the capitalist in the form of available capital. He
advances this part as capital, gives it to the labourer for new labour-power,
while the labourer consumes it as revenue directly or indirectly through
exchange for other commodities. That portion of the value of the product, then,
which is destined in the course of reproduction to be converted into wages, into
revenue for the labourers, first flows back into the hands of the capitalist in
the form of capital, or more accurately variable capital. It is an essential
requirement that it should flow back in this form in order for labour as
wage-labour, the means of production as capital, and the process of production
itself as a capitalist process, to be continually reproduced anew.</p>
<p>In order to avoid unnecessary difficulty, one should distinguish gross
output and net output from gross income and net income.</p>
<p>The gross output, or gross product, is the total reproduced product. With
the exception of the employed but not consumed portion of fixed capital, the
value of the gross output, or gross product, equals the value of capital
advanced and consumed in production, that is, constant and variable capital plus
surplus-value, which resolves itself into profit and rent. Or, if we consider
the product of the total social capital instead of that of an individual
capital, the gross output equals the material elements forming the constant and
variable capital, plus the material elements of the surplus-product in which
profit and rent are represented.</p>
<p>The gross income is that portion of value and that portion of the gross
product measured by it which remains after deducting that portion of value and
that portion of the product of total production measured by it which replaces
the constant capital advanced and consumed in production. The gross income,
then, is equal to wages (or the portion of the product destined to again become
the income of the labourer) + profit + rent. The net income, on the other hand, is
the surplus-value, and thus the surplus-product, which remains after deducting
wages, and which, in fact, thus represents the surplus-value realised by capital
and to be divided with the landlord, and the surplus-product measured by it.</p>
<p>Thus, we saw that the value of each individual commodity and the value of
the total commodity-product of each individual capital is divided into two
parts: one replaces only constant capital, and the other, although a fraction of
it flows back as variable capital — thus also flows back in the <i>form</i> of
capital — nevertheless is destined to be wholly transformed into gross income,
and to assume the form of wages, profit and rent, the sum of which makes up the
gross income. Furthermore, we saw that the same is true of the value of the
annual total product of a society. A difference between the product of the
individual capitalist and that of society exists only in so far as: from the
standpoint of the individual capitalist the net income differs from the gross
income, for the latter includes the wages, whereas the former excludes them.
Viewing the income of the whole society, national income consists of wages plus
profit plus rent, thus, of the gross income. But even this is an abstraction to
the extent that the entire society, on the basis of capitalist production, bases
itself on the capitalist standpoint and thereby considers only the income
resolved into profit and rent as net income.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the fantasy of men like Say, to the effect that the
entire yield, the entire gross output, resolves itself into the net income of
the nation or cannot be distinguished from it, that this distinction therefore
disappears from the national viewpoint, is but the inevitable and ultimate
expression of the absurd dogma pervading political economy since Adam Smith,
that in the final analysis the value of commodities resolves itself completely
into income, into wages, profit and rent.<a href="#N51" id="R51"><sup class="enote">[51]</sup></a></p>
<p>To comprehend, in the case of each individual capitalist, that a portion of
his product must be transformed again into capital (even aside from the
expansion of reproduction, or accumulation), indeed not only into variable
capital, which is destined to again become in its turn income for the labourers,
thus a form of revenue, but also into constant capital, which can never be
transformed into revenue — such discernment is naturally extraordinarily easy.
The simplest observation of the process of production shows this clearly. The
difficulty first begins as soon as the process of production is viewed as a
whole. The value of the entire portion of the product which is consumed as
revenue in the form of wages, profit and rent (it is entirely immaterial whether
the consumption is individual or productive), indeed, completely resolves itself
under analysis into the sum of values consisting of wages plus profit plus rent,
that is, into the total value of the three revenues, although the value of this
portion of the product, just like that which does not enter into revenue,
contains a value portion = C, equal to the value of the constant capital contained
in these portions, and thus <i>prima facie</i> cannot be limited by the value
of the revenue. This circumstance which, on the one hand, is a practically
irrefutable fact, on the other hand, an equally undeniable theoretical
contradiction presents a difficulty which is most easily circumvented by the
assertion that commodity-value contains another portion of value, merely
appearing to differ, from the standpoint of the individual capitalist, from the
portion existing in the form of revenue. The phrase: that which appears as
revenue for one constitutes capital for another, relieves one of the necessity
for any further reflection. But how, then, the old capital can be replaced when
the value of the entire product is consumable in the form of revenue; and how
the value of the product of each individual capital can be equal to the value
sum of the three revenues plus C, constant capital, whereas the sum of the
values of the products of all capitals is equal to the value sum of the three
revenues plus 0 — this appears, of course, as an insoluble riddle and must be
solved by declaring that the analysis is completely incapable of unravelling the
simple elements of price, and must be content to go around in a vicious circle
making a spurious advance <i>ad infinitum.</i> Thus, that which appears as
constant capital may be resolved into wages, profit and rent, but the
commodity-values in which wages, profit and rent appear, are determined in their
turn by wages, profit and rent, and so forth <i>ad infinitum</i>.
<sup class="enote"><a href="#N52" id="52">[52]</a></sup></p>
<p>The fundamentally erroneous dogma to the effect that the value of
commodities in the last analysis may be resolved into wages + profit + rent also
expresses itself in the proposition that the consumer must ultimately pay for
the total value of the total product; or also that the money circulation between
producers and consumers must ultimately be equal to the money circulation
between the producers themselves (Tooke); all these propositions are as false as
the axiom upon which they are based.</p>
<p>The difficulties, which lead to this erroneous and <i>prima facie</i> absurd
analysis, are briefly these:</p>
<p>1) The fundamental relationship of constant and variable capital, hence also
the nature of surplus-value, and thereby the entire basis of the capitalist mode
of production, are not understood. The value of each partial product of capital,
each individual commodity, contains a portion of value = constant capital, a
portion of value = variable capital (transformed into wages for labourers), and a
portion of value = surplus-value (later split into profit and rent). Thus, how is
it possible for the labourer with his wages, the capitalist with his profit, the
landlord with his rent, to be able to buy commodities, each of which contains
not only one of these constituent elements, but all three of them; and how is it
possible for the sum of the values of wages, profit and rent, that is, the three
sources of revenue together, to be able to buy the commodities which go to make
up the total consumption of the recipients of these incomes — commodities
containing an additional component of value, namely constant capital, outside
these three components of value? How should they buy a value of four with a
value of three?
<sup class="enote"><a href="#n53" id="r53">[53]</a></sup></p>
<p>We presented our analysis in Book II, Part III.</p>
<p>2) The method is not grasped whereby labour, in adding a new value,
preserves the old value in a new form without producing this old value anew.</p>
<p>3) The pattern of the process of reproduction is not understood — how it
appears not from the standpoint of individual capital, but rather from that of
the total capital; the difficulty is not understood how it is that the product
in which wages and surplus-value, in short, the entire value produced by all the
labour newly added during the year, is realised, replaces the constant part of
its value and yet at the same time resolves itself into value limited solely by
the revenues; and furthermore how it is that the constant capital consumed in
production can be replaced in substance and value by new capital, although the
total sum of newly added labour is realised only in wages and surplus-value, and
is fully represented in the sum of the values of both. It is precisely here that
the main difficulty lies, in the analysis of reproduction and the relations of
its various component parts, both as concerns their material character and their
value relationships.</p>
<p>4) To these difficulties is added still another, which increases even more
as soon as the various component parts of surplus-value appear in the form of
mutually independent revenues. This difficulty consists in the definite
designations of revenue and capital interchanging, and altering their position,
so that they seem to be merely relative determinations from the point of view of
the individual capitalist and to disappear when the total process of production
is viewed as a whole. For instance, the revenue of the labourers and capitalists
of Class I, which produces constant capital, replaces in value and substance the
constant capital of the capitalists of Class II, which produces articles of
consumption. One may, therefore, squeeze out of the dilemma by remonstrating
that what is revenue for one is capital for another and that these designations
thus have nothing to do with the actual peculiarities of the value components of
commodities. Furthermore: commodities which are ultimately destined to form the
substantive elements of revenue expenditure, that is, articles of consumption,
pass through various stages during the year, e.g., woollen yarn, cloth. In one
stage they form a portion of constant capital, in the other they are consumed
individually, and thus pass wholly into the revenue. One may therefore imagine
along with Adam Smith that constant capital is but an apparent element of
commodity-value, which disappears in the total pattern. Thus, a further exchange
takes place of variable capital for revenue. The labourer buys with his wages
that portion of commodities which form his revenue. In this way he
simultaneously replaces for the capitalist the money-form of variable capital.
Finally: one portion of products which form constant capital is replaced in kind
or through exchange by the producers of constant capital themselves; a process
with which the consumers have nothing to do. When this is overlooked the
impression is created that the revenue of consumers replaces the entire product,
i.e., including the constant portion of value.</p>
<p>5) Aside from the confusion which the transformation of values into prices
of production brings about, another arises due to the transformation of
surplus-value into different, special, mutually independent forms of revenue
applying to the various elements of production, i.e., into profit and rent. It
is forgotten that the fact that the values of commodities are the basis, and
that the division of these commodity-values into distinct constituent parts, and
the further development of these constituents of value into forms of revenue,
their transmutation into relations of various owners of different factors of
production to these individual components of value, their distribution among
these owners according to definite categories and titles, itself alters nothing
in value determination and its law. Just as little is the law of value changed
by the circumstance that the equalisation of profit, i.e., the distribution of
the total surplus-value among the various capitals, and the obstacles which
landed property partially (in absolute rent) puts in the way of this
equalisation, bring about a divergence between the regulating average prices and
the individual values of commodities. This again affects merely the addition of
surplus-value to the various commodity-prices, but does not abolish
surplus-value itself, nor the total value of commodities as the source of these
various component parts of price.</p>
<p>This is the <i>quid pro quo</i> which we shall consider in the next
chapter, and which is inevitably linked with the illusion that value arises out
of its own component parts. And namely, the various component values of the
commodity acquire independent forms as revenues, and as such revenues they are
related back to the particular material elements of production as their sources
of origin instead of to the value of the commodity as their source. They are
actually related back to those sources — however, not as components of value,
but rather as revenues, as components of value falling to the share of these
particular categories of agents in production: the labourer, the capitalist and
the landlord. But then one might fancy that these constituents of value, rather
than arising out of the division of commodity-value, conversely form it instead
only through their combination, which leads to the pretty and vicious circle,
whereby the value of commodities arises out of the sum of the values of wages,
profit and rent, and the value of wages, profit and rent, in its turn, is
determined by the value of commodities, etc.
<sup class="enote"><a href="#n54" id="r54">[54]</a></sup></p>
<p>Considering reproduction in its normal state, only a part of newly added
labour is employed for production, and thus for replacement of constant capital;
precisely that part which replaces the constant capital used up in the
production of articles of consumption, of material elements of revenue. This is
balanced by the fact that this constant portion of Class II costs no additional
labour. But, now, this constant capital (looking upon the total process of
reproduction, in which then the above-mentioned equalisation of Classes I and II
is included), not representing a product of newly added labour, although this
product could not be created without it — this constant capital, in the process
of reproduction, considered from the standpoint of substance, is exposed to
certain accidents and dangers which could decimate it. (Furthermore, however,
considered from the point of view of value as well, it may be depreciated
through a change in the productiveness of labour; but this refers only to the
individual capitalist.) Accordingly, a portion of the profit, therefore of
surplus-value and thereby also surplus-product, in which (as concerns value)
only newly added labour is represented, serves as an insurance fund. And it
matters not whether this insurance fund is managed by insurance companies as a
separate business or not. This is the sole portion of revenue which is neither
consumed as such nor serves necessarily as a fund for accumulation. Whether it
actually serves as such, or covers merely a loss in reproduction, depends upon
chance. This is also the only portion of surplus-value and surplus-product, and
thus of surplus-labour, which would continue to exist, outside of that portion
serving for accumulation, and hence expansion of the process of reproduction,
even after the abolition of the capitalist mode of production. This, of course,
presupposes that the portion regularly consumed by direct producers does not
remain limited to its present minimum. Apart from surplus-labour for those who
on account of age are not yet, or no longer, able to take part in production,
all labour to support those who do not work would cease. If we think back to the
beginnings of society, we find no produced means of production, hence no
constant capital, the value of which could pass into the product, and which, in
reproduction on the same scale, would have to be replaced in kind out of the
product and to a degree measured by its value. But Nature there directly
provides the means of subsistence, which need not first be produced. Nature
thereby also gives to the savage who has but few wants to satisfy the time, not
to use the as yet non-existent means of production in new production, but to
transform, alongside the labour required to appropriate naturally existing means
of production, other products of Nature into means of production: bows, stone
knives, boats, etc. This process among savages, considered merely from the
substantive side, corresponds to the reconversion of surplus-labour into new
capital. In the process of accumulation, the conversion of such products of
excess labour into capital obtains continually; and the circumstance that all
new capital arises out of profit, rent, or other forms of revenue, i.e., out of
surplus-labour, leads to the mistaken idea that all value of commodities arises
from some revenue. This reconversion of profit into capital shows rather upon
closer analysis that, conversely, the additional labour — which is always
represented in the form of revenue — does not serve for the maintenance, or
reproduction respectively, of the old capital value, but for the creation of new
excess capital so far as it is not consumed as revenue.</p>
<p>The whole difficulty arises from the fact that all newly added labour, in so
far as the value created by it is not resolved into wages, appears as profit —
interpreted here as a form of surplus-value in general — i.e., as a value which
costs the capitalist nothing and which, of course, therefore does not have to
replace for him anything advanced, any capital whatever. This value thus exists
in the form of available additional wealth, in short, from the viewpoint of the
individual capitalist, in the form of his revenue. But this newly created value
can just as well be consumed productively as individually, equally well as
capital or revenue. As a consequence of its natural form, some of it must be
productively consumed. It is, therefore, evident that the annually added labour
creates capital as well as revenue; as becomes evident in the process of
accumulation. However, the portion of labour-power employed in the creation of
new capital (thus analogous to that portion of the working-day employed by a
savage, not for acquiring subsistence, but to fashion tools with which to
acquire his subsistence) becomes invisible in that the entire product of
surplus-labour first appears in the form of profit; a designation which indeed
has nothing to do with this surplus-product itself, but refers merely to the
individual relation of the capitalist to the surplus-value pocketed by him. In
fact, the surplus-value created by the labourer is divided into revenue and
capital; i.e., into articles of consumption and additional means of production.
But former constant capital taken over from the previous year (leaving aside the
portion impaired and thus <i>pro tanto</i> destroyed, thus so far as it does
not have to be reproduced — and such disturbances in the process of
reproduction fall under insurance) is not reproduced as concerns value by the
newly added labour.</p>
<p>We see, furthermore, that a portion of the newly added labour is continually
absorbed in the reproduction and replacement of consumed constant capital,
although this newly added labour resolves itself solely into revenue, into
wages, profit and rent. But it is thereby overlooked 1) that one value portion
of the product of this labour <i>is no</i> product of this new additional
labour, but rather pre-existing and consumed constant capital; that the portion
of the product in which this part of value appears is thus also not transformed
into revenue, but replaces the means of production of this constant capital in
kind; 2) that the portion of value in which this newly added labour actually
appears is not consumed as revenue in kind, but replaces the constant capital in
another sphere, where it is transformed into a natural form, in which it may be
consumed as revenue, but which in its turn is again not entirely a product of
newly added labour.</p>
<p>In so far as reproduction obtains on the same scale, every consumed element
of constant capital must be replaced in kind by a new specimen of the same kind,
if not in quantity and form, then at least in effectiveness. If the
productiveness of labour remains the same, then this replacement in kind implies
replacing the same value which the constant capital had in its old form. But
should the productiveness of labour increase, so that the same material elements
may be reproduced with less labour, then a smaller portion of the value of the
product can completely replace the constant part in kind. The excess may then be
employed to form new additional capital or a larger portion of the product may
be given the form of articles of consumption, or the surplus-labour may be
reduced. On the other hand, should the productiveness of labour decrease, then a
larger portion of the product must be used for the replacement of the former
capital, and the surplus-product decreases.</p>
<p>The reconversion of profit, or generally of any form of surplus-value, into
capital shows — leaving aside the historically defined economic form and
considering it merely as the simple formation of new means of production — that
the situation still prevails whereby the labourer performs labour to produce
means of production beyond the labour for acquiring his immediate means of
subsistence. Transformation of profit into capital is no more than employing a
portion of excess labour to form new, additional means of production. That this
takes place in the shape of a transformation of profit into capital signifies
merely that it is the capitalist rather than the labourer who disposes of excess
labour. That this excess labour must first pass through a stage in which it
appears as revenue (whereas, e.g., in the case of a savage it appears as excess
labour directly destined for the production of means of production) means simply
that this labour, or its product, is appropriated by the non-worker. However,
what is actually transformed into capital is not profit as such. Transformation
of surplus-value into capital signifies merely that the surplus-value and
surplus-product are not consumed individually as revenue by the capitalist. But,
what is actually so transformed is value, materialised labour, or the product in
which this value is directly manifested, or for which it is exchanged after
having been previously transformed into money. And when the profit is
transformed back into capital, this definite form of surplus-value, or profit,
does not form the source of the new capital. The surplus-value is thereby merely
changed from one form into another. But it is not this change of form which
turns it into capital. It is the commodity and its value which now function as
capital. However, that the value of the commodity is not paid for — and only by
this means does it become surplus-value — is quite irrelevant for the
materialisation of labour, the value itself.</p>
<p>The misunderstanding is expressed in various forms. For instance, that the
commodities which compose the constant capital also contain elements of wages,
profit and rent. Or, on the other hand, that what is revenue for the one is
capital for another, and that therefore these are but subjective relations. Thus
the yarn of the spinner contains a portion of value representing profit for him,
Should the weaver buy the yarn, he realises the profit of the spinner, but for
himself this yarn is merely a part of his constant capital.</p>
<p>Aside from the previous remarks made concerning the relations between
revenue and capital, the following is to be noted: That which, as regards value,
passes along with the yarn as a constituent element into the capital of the
weaver, is the value of the yarn. In what manner the parts of this value have
been resolved for the spinner himself into capital and revenue, or, in other
words, into paid and unpaid labour, is completely irrelevant for the value
determination of the commodity itself (aside from modifications through the
average profit). Back of this still lurks the idea that the profit, or
surplus-value in general, is an excess above the value of the commodity, which
can only be made by an extra charge, mutual cheating, or gain through selling.
When the price of production is paid, or even the value of the commodity, the
component values of the commodity which appear to the seller in the form of
revenue are naturally also paid. Monopoly prices, of course, are not referred to
here.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is quite correct to say that the component parts of commodities
which make up the constant capital, like any other commodity-value, may be
reduced to portions of value which resolve themselves for the producers and the
owners of the means of production into wages, profit and rent. This is merely a
capitalist form of expression for the fact that all commodity-value is but the
measure of the socially necessary labour contained in a commodity. But it has
already been shown in Book I that this nowise prevents the commodity-product of
any capital from being split into separate parts, of which one represents
exclusively the constant portion of capital, another the variable portion of
capital, and a third solely surplus-value.</p>
<p>Storch expresses the opinion of many others when he says:</p>
<p class="indentb">"The saleable products which make up the national revenue must be considered in political economy in two different ways: relative to individuals as values, and relative to the nation as goods; for the revenue of a nation is not appraised, like that of an individual, by its value, but by its utility or by the wants which it can
satisfy." (<i>Considérations sur le revenu national,</i> p. 19.)</p>
<p>In the first place, it is a false abstraction to regard a nation whose mode
of production is based upon value, and furthermore is capitalistically
organised, as an aggregate body working merely for the satisfaction of the
national wants.</p>
<p>Secondly, after the abolition of the capitalist mode of production, but
still retaining social production, the determination of value continues to
prevail in the sense that the regulation of labour-time and the distribution of
social labour among the various production groups, ultimately the book-keeping
encompassing all this, become more essential than ever.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="information">
<span class="term"><a href="#R51" id="N51">51.</a></span> Ricardo makes the
following very apt comment on thoughtless Say: "Of net produce and gross
produce, M. Say speaks as follows: ‘The whole value produced is the gross
produce; this value, after deducting from it the cost of production, is the net
produce.’ (Vol. II, p. 491.) There can, then, be no net produce, because
the cost of production, according to M. Say, consists of rent, wages and
profits. On page 508 he says: ‘The value of a product, the value of a
productive service, the value of the cost of production, are all, then, similar
values, whenever things are left to their natural course.’ Take a whole
from a whole, and nothing remains." (Ricardo, <i>Principles,</i> Chapter
XXII, p.512, Note.)  — By the way we shall see later that Ricardo now refuted
Smith’s false analysis of commodity-price, its reduction to the sum of the
values of the revenues. He does not bother with it, and accepts its correctness
so far in his analysis that he "abstracts" from the constant portion
of the value of commodities. He also falls back into the same way of looking at
things from time to time.</p>
<p class="information">
<span class="term"><a href="#52" id="N52">52.</a></span> "In every
society the price of every commodity finally resolves itself into some one or
other, or all of those three parts [viz., wages, profits, rent] ... A fourth
part, it may perhaps be thought, is necessary for replacing the stock of the
farmer or for compensating the wear and tear of his labouring cattle, and other
instruments of husbandry. But it must be considered that the price of any
instrument of husbandry, such as a labouring horse, is itself made up of the
same three parts: the rent of the land upon which he is reared, the labour of
tending and rearing him, and the profits of the farmer, who advances both the
rent of his land and the wages of his labour. Though the price of the corn,
therefore, may pay the price as well as the maintenance of the horse, the whole
price still resolves itself either immediately or ultimately into the same three
parts of rent, labour [meaning wages] and profit." (Adam Smith.) — We
shall show later on how Adam Smith himself feels the inconsistency and
insufficiency of this subterfuge, for it is nothing but a subterfuge on his part
to send us from Pontius to Pilate while nowhere does he indicate the real
investment of capital, in which case the price of the product resolves itself
ultimately into these three parts, without any further <i>progressus.</i></p>

<span class="term"><a href="#r53" id="n53">53.</a></span> Proudhon exposes
his inability to grasp this in the ignorant formulation: <i>L’ouvrier ne
peut pas racheter son propre produit</i> (the labourer cannot buy back his own
product), because the interest which is added to the <i>prix-de-revient</i> (cost-price) is contained in the product. But how does M. Eugène Forcade teach him to
know better? "If Proudhon’s objection were correct, it would strike
not only the profits of capital, but would eliminate the possibility even of
industry. If the labourer is compelled to pay 100 for each article for which he
has received only 80, if his wages can buy back only the value which he has put
into a product, it could be said that the labourer cannot buy back anything,
that wages cannot pay for anything. In fact, there is always something more than
the wages of the labourer contained in the cost-price, and always more than the
profits of enterprise in the selling price, for instance, the price of raw
materials, often paid to foreign countries. ... Proudhon has forgotten about the
continual growth of national capital; he has forgotten that this growth refers
to all labourers, whether in an enterprise or in handicrafts." <i>(Revue
des deux Mondes,</i> 1848, Tome 24, p. 998.) Here we have the optimism of
bourgeois thoughtlessness in the form of sagacity that most corresponds to it.
M. Forcade first believes that the labourer could not live did he not receive a
higher value than that which he produces, whereas conversely the capitalist mode
of production could not exist were he really to receive all the value which he
produces. Secondly, he correctly generalises the difficulty, which Proudhon
expressed only from a narrow viewpoint. The price of commodities contains not
only an excess over wages, but also over profit, namely, the constant portion of
value. According to Proudhon’s reasoning, then, the capitalist too could
not buy back the commodities with his profit. And how does Forcade solve this
riddle? By means of a meaningless phrase: the growth of capital. Thus the
continual growth of capital is also supposed to be substantiated, among other
things, in that the analysis of commodity-prices, which is impossible for the
political economist as regards a capital of 100, becomes superfluous in the case
of a capital of 10,000. What would be said of a chemist, who, on being asked,
How is it that the product of the soil contains more carbon than the soil? would
answer: It comes from the continual increase in agricultural production. The
well-meaning desire to discover in the bourgeois world the best of all possible
worlds replaces in vulgar economy all need for love of truth and inclination for
scientific investigation.</p>
<p class="information">
<span class="term"><a href="#r54" id="n54">54.</a></span> "The
circulating capital invested in materials, raw materials and finished goods is
itself composed of goods, the necessary price of which is formed of the same
elements; so that, viewing the total goods in one country, it would mean
duplication to count this portion of circulating capital among the elements of
the necessary price." (Storch, <i>Cours d’économie politique,</i> II, p. 140.) — By these elements of circulating capital Storch means the value of constant capital (fixed capital is merely circulating in a
different form. "It is true that the wages of the labourer, like that
portion of profit of enterprise which consists of wages, if we consider them as
a part of the means of subsistence, also consist of goods bought at current
prices and which likewise comprise wages, interest on capital, ground-rent and
profit of enterprise.... This observation merely serves to prove that it is
impossible to resolve the necessary price into its simplest elements.’, (<i>ibid,</i> Note.) — In his <i>Considérations sur la nature du revenu national</i> (Paris, 1824), Storch indeed realises in his controversy with Say to what absurdity the erroneous analysis of commodity-value leads — when it resolves value into mere revenues. He correctly points out the folly of such results — not from the viewpoint of the individual capitalist, but from that of a nation
— but himself goes no step further in his analysis of the <i>prix nécessaire</i> from that presented in his <i>Cours,</i> that it is impossible to resolve it into its actual elements, without resolving it into a spurious advance <i>ad infinitum.</i> "It is evident that the value of’ the annual product is divided partly into capitals and partly into profits, and that each one of these portions of value of the annual product regularly goes to buy the products
needed by the nation, as much to preserve its capital as to renew its
consumption fund (pp. 134, 135).... Can it" (a self-employed peasant family) "live in its barns or stables, eat its seed and forage, clothe itself with its draught
cattle, dispense with its agricultural implements? According to the thesis of M.
Say one must answer all these questions in the affirmative (pp. 135, 136) .... If
it is admitted that the revenue of a nation is equal to its gross product, i.e.,
if no capital has to be deducted from it, then it must also be admitted that a
nation can spend the entire value of its annual product unproductively without
impairing its future income in the least (147). The products which constitute
the capital of a nation are not consumable" (p.150). </p>

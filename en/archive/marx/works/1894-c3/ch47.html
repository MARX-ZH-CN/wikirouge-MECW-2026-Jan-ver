Transformation of Surplus-Profit into Ground-Rent</p>
<h1>Chapter 47. Genesis of Capitalist Ground-Rent</h1>
<a id="1"></a>
<p> </p>
<h5>I. Introductory Remarks</h5>
<p>We must clarify in our minds wherein lies the real difficulty in analysing
ground-rent from the viewpoint of modern economics, as the theoretical
expression of the capitalist mode of production. Even many of the more modern
writers have not as yet grasped this, as evidenced by each renewed attempt to
"newly" explain ground-rent. The novelty almost invariably consists in a
relapse into long out-of-date views. The difficulty is not to explain the
surplus-product produced by agricultural capital and its corresponding
surplus-value in general. This question is solved in the analysis of the
surplus-value produced by all productive capital, in whatever sphere it may be
invested. The difficulty consists rather in showing the source of the excess of
surplus-value paid the landlord by capital invested in land in the form of
rent, after equalisation of the surplus-value to the average profit among the
various capitals, after the various capitals have shared in the total
surplus-value produced by the social capital in all spheres of production in
proportion to their relative size; in other words, the source subsequent to
this equalisation and the apparently already completed distribution of all
surplus-value which, in general, is to be distributed. Quite apart from the
practical motives, which prodded modern economists as spokesmen of industrial
capital against landed property to investigate this question — motives
which we shall point out more clearly in the chapter on history of ground-rent
— the question was of paramount interest to them as theorists. To admit
that the appearance of rent for capital invested in agriculture is due to some
particular effect produced by the sphere of investment itself, due to singular
qualities of the earth’s crust itself, is tantamount to giving up the
conception of value as such, thus tantamount to abandoning all attempts at a
scientific understanding of this field. Even the simple observation that rent
is paid out of the price of agricultural produce — which takes place even
where rent is paid in kind if the farmer is to recover his price of production
— showed the absurdity of attempting to explain the excess of this price
over the ordinary price of production; in other words, to explain the relative
dearness of agricultural products on the basis of the excess of natural
productivity of agricultural production over the productivity of other lines of
production. For the reverse is true: the more productive labour is, the cheaper
is every aliquot part of its product, because so much greater is the mass of
use-values incorporating the same quantity of labour, i.e., the same value.</p>
<p>The whole difficulty in analysing rent, therefore, consists in explaining
the excess of agricultural profit over the average profit, not the
surplus-value, but the excess of surplus-value characteristic of this sphere of
production; in other words, not the "net product", but the excess of this net
product over the net product of other branches of industry. The average profit
itself is a product formed under very definite historical production relations
by the movement of social processes, a product which, as we have seen, requires
very complex adjustment. To be able to speak at all of a surplus over the
average profit, this average profit itself must already be established as a
standard and as a regulator of production in general as is the case under
capitalist production. For this reason there can be no talk of rent in the
modern sense, a rent consisting of a surplus over the average profit, i.e.,
over and above the proportional share of each individual capital in the
surplus-value produced by the total social capital, in social formations where
it is not capital which performs the function of enforcing all surplus-labour
and appropriating directly all surplus-value. And where therefore capital has
not yet completely, or only sporadically, brought social labour under its
control. It reflects naïveté, e.g., of a person like Passy (see below), when he
speaks of rent in primitive society as a surplus over profit [Passy, <i>Rente
du sol.</i> In: Dictionnaire de l’économie politique, Tome II. Paris,
1854, p. 511. — <i>Ed</i>.] — a historically defined social form
of surplus-value, but which, according to Passy, might almost as well exist
without any society.</p>
<p>For the older economists, who in general merely begin analysing the
capitalist mode of production, still undeveloped in their day, the analysis of
rent offers either no difficulty at all, or only a difficulty of a completely
different kind. Petty, Cantillon, and in general those writers who are closer
to feudal times, assume ground-rent to be the normal form of surplus-value in
general, [ [Petty] <i>A Treatise on Taxes and Contributions,</i> London,
1667, pp. 23-24; [Richard Cantillon] <i>Essai sur la nature du commerce en
géneral,</i> Amsterdam, 1756. — <i>Ed</i>.] whereas profit to them is
still amorphously combined with wages, or at best appears to be a portion of
surplus-value extorted by the capitalist from the landlord. These writers thus
take as their point of departure a situation where, in the first place, the
agricultural population still constitutes the overwhelming majority of the
nation, and, secondly, the landlord still appears as the person appropriating
at first hand the surplus-labour of the direct producers by virtue of his
monopoly of landed property, where landed property, therefore, still appears as
the main condition of production. For these writers the question could not yet
be posed, which, inversely, seeks to investigate from the viewpoint of
capitalist production how landed property manages to wrest back again from
capital a portion of the surplus-value produced by it (that is, filched by it
from the direct producers) and already appropriated directly.</p>
<p>The <i>physiocrats</i> are troubled by difficulties of another nature. As
the actually first systematic spokesmen of capital, they attempt to analyse the
nature of surplus-value in general. For them, this analysis coincides with the
analysis of rent, the only form of surplus-value which they recognise.
Therefore, they consider rent-yielding, or agricultural, capital to be the only
capital producing surplus-value, and the agricultural labour set in motion by
it, the only labour producing surplus-value, which from a capitalist viewpoint
is quite properly considered the only productive labour. They are quite right
in considering the creation of surplus-value as decisive. Apart from other
merits to be set forth in Book IV, they deserve credit primarily for going back
from merchant’s capital, which functions solely in the sphere of
circulation, to productive capital, in opposition to the mercantile system,
which, with its crude realism, constitutes the actual vulgar economy of that
period, pushing into the background in favour of its own practical interests
the beginnings of scientific analysis made by Petty and his successors. In this
critique of the mercantile system, incidentally, only its conceptions of
capital and surplus-value are dealt with. It has already been indicated
previously that the monetary system correctly proclaims production for the
world-market and the transformation of the output into commodities, and thus
into money, as the prerequisite and condition of capitalist production. In this
system’s further development into the mercantile system, it is no longer
the transformation of commodity-value into money, but the creation of
surplus-value which is decisive — but from the meaningless viewpoint of
the circulation sphere and, at the same time, in such manner that this surplus
value is represented as surplus money, as the balance of trade surplus. At the
same time, however, the characteristic feature of the interested merchants and
manufacturers of that period, which is in keeping with the stage of capitalist
development represented by them, is that the transformation of feudal
agricultural societies into industrial ones and the corresponding industrial
struggle of nations on the world-market depends on an accelerated development
of capital, which is not to be arrived at along the so-called natural path, but
rather by means of coercive measures. It makes a tremendous difference whether
national capital is gradually and slowly transformed into industrial capital,
or whether this development is accelerated by means of a tax which they impose
through protective duties mainly upon landowners, middle and small peasants,
and handicraftsmen, by way of accelerated expropriation of the independent
direct producers, and through the violently accelerated accumulation and
concentration of capital, in short by means of the accelerated establishment of
conditions of capitalist production. It simultaneously makes an enormous
difference in the capitalist and industrial exploitation of the natural
national productive power. Hence the national character of the mercantile
system is not merely a phrase on the lips of its spokesmen. Under the pretext
of concern solely for the wealth of the nation and the resources of the state,
they, in fact, pronounce the interests of the capitalist class and the amassing
of riches in general to be the ultimate aim of the state, and thus proclaim
bourgeois society in place of the old divine state. But at the same time they
are consciously aware that the development of the interests of capital and of
the capitalist class, of capitalist production, forms the foundation of
national power and national ascendancy in modern society.</p>
<p>The physiocrats, furthermore, are correct in stating that in fact all
production of surplus-value, and thus all development of capital, has for its
natural basis the productiveness of agricultural labour. If man were not
capable of producing in one working-day more means of subsistence, which
signifies in the strictest sense more agricultural products than every labourer
needs for his own reproduction, if the daily expenditure of his entire labour
power sufficed merely to produce the means of subsistence indispensable for his
own individual requirements, then one could not speak at all either of
surplus-product or surplus-value. An agricultural labour productivity exceeding
the individual requirements of the labourer is the basis of all societies, and
is above all the basis of capitalist production, which disengages a constantly
increasing portion of society from the production of basic foodstuffs and
transforms them into "free heads," as Steuart [Steuart, <i>An Inquiry Into the
Principles of Political Economy,</i> Vol. I, Dublin, 1770, p. 396. —
<i>Ed.</i>] has it, making them available for exploitation in other
spheres.</p>
<p>But what can be said of more recent writers on economics, such as Daire,
Passy, etc., who parrot the most primitive conceptions concerning the natural
conditions of surplus-labour and thereby surplus-value in general, in the
twilight of classical economy, indeed on its very death-bed, and who imagine
that they are thus propounding something new and striking on ground-rent
[Daire, <i>Introduction. In: Physiocrats, 1.</i> Teil, Paris, 1846; Passy,
<i>Rente du sol.</i> In: Dictionnaire de l’économie politique, Tome II,
Paris, 1854, p. 511. — <i>Ed.</i>] long after this ground-rent has been
investigated as a special form and become a specific portion of surplus-value?
It is particularly characteristic of vulgar economy that it echoes what was
new, original, profound and justified during a specific outgrown stage of
development, in a period when it has turned platitudinous, stale, and false. It
thus confesses its complete ignorance of the problems which concerned classical
economy. It confounds them with questions that could only have been posed on a
lower level of development of bourgeois society. The same holds true of its
incessant and self-complacent rumination of the physiocratic phrases concerning
free trade. These phrases have long since lost all theoretical interest, no
matter how much they may engage the practical attention of this or that
state.</p>
<p>In natural economy proper, when no part of the agricultural product, or but
a very insignificant portion, enters into the process of circulation, and then
only a relatively small portion of that part of the product which represents
the landlord’s revenue, as, e.g., in many Roman latifundia, or upon the
villas of Charlemagne, or more or less during the entire Middle Ages (see
Vinçard, <i>Histoire du travail</i>), the product and surplus-product of the
large estates consists by no means purely of products of agricultural labour.
It encompasses equally well the products of industrial labour. Domestic
handicrafts and manufacturing labour as secondary occupations of agriculture,
which forms the basis, are the prerequisite of that mode of production upon
which natural economy rests — in European antiquity and the Middle Ages
as well as in the present-day Indian community, in which the traditional
organisation has not yet been destroyed. The capitalist mode of production
completely abolishes this relationship; a process which may be studied on a
large scale particularly in England during the last third of the 18th century.
Thinkers like Herrenschwand, who had grown up in more or less semi-feudal
societies, still consider, e.g., as late as the close of the 18th century, this
separation of manufacture from agriculture as a foolhardy social adventure, as
an unthinkably risky mode of existence. And even in the agricultural economies
of antiquity showing the greatest analogy to capitalist agriculture, namely
Carthage and Rome, the similarity to a plantation economy is greater than to a
form corresponding to the really capitalist mode of exploitation.<a href="#n42a" id="r42a"><sup class="enote">[42a]</sup></a> A formal analogy,
which, simultaneously, however, turns out to be completely illusory in all
essential points to a person familiar with the capitalist mode of production,
who does not, like Herr Mommsen,<a href="#n43" id="r43"><sup class="enote">[43]</sup></a> discover a capitalist mode of production in every
monetary economy, is not to be found at all in continental Italy during
antiquity, but at best only in Sicily, since this island served Rome as an
agricultural tributary so that its agriculture was aimed chiefly at export.
Farmers in the modern sense existed there.</p>
<p>An erroneous conception of the nature of rent is based upon the fact that
rent in kind, partly as tithes to the church and partly as a curiosity
perpetuated by long-established contracts, has been dragged over into modern
times from the natural economy of the Middle Ages, completely in contradiction
to the conditions of the capitalist mode of production. It thereby creates the
impression that rent does not arise from the price of the agricultural product,
but from its mass, thus not from social conditions, but from the earth. We have
previously shown that although surplus-value is manifested in a surplus-product
the converse does not hold that a surplus-product, representing a mere increase
in the mass of product, constitutes surplus-value. It may represent a minus
quantity in value. Otherwise the cotton industry of 1860, compared with that of
1840, would show an enormous surplus-value, whereas on the contrary the price
of the yarn has fallen. Rent may increase enormously as a result of a
succession of crop failures, because the price of grain rises, although this
surplus-value appears as an absolutely decreasing mass of dearer wheat.
Conversely, the rent may fall in consequence of a succession of bountiful
years, because the price falls, although the reduced rent appears as a greater
mass of cheaper wheat. As regards rent in kind, it should be noted now that, in
the first place, it is a mere tradition carried over from an obsolete mode of
production and managing to prolong its existence as a survival. Its
contradiction to the capitalist mode of production is shown by its
disappearance of itself from private contracts, and its being forcibly shaken
off as an anachronism, wherever legislation was able to intervene as in the
case of church tithes in England. Secondly, however, where rent in kind
persisted on the basis of capitalist production, it was no more, and could be
no more, than an expression of money-rent in medieval garb. Wheat, for
instance, is quoted at 40 shillings per quarter. One portion of this wheat must
replace the wages contained therein, and must be sold to become available for
renewed expenditure. Another portion must be sold to pay its proportionate
share of taxes. Seed and even a portion of fertiliser enter as commodities into
the process of reproduction, wherever the capitalist mode of production and
with it division of social labour are developed, i.e., they must be purchased
for replacement purposes; and therefore another portion of this quarter must be
sold to obtain money for this. In so far as they need not be bought as actual
commodities, but are taken out of the product itself in kind, in order to enter
into its reproduction anew as conditions of production — as occurs not
only in agriculture, but in many other lines of production producing constant
capital — they figure in the books as money of account and are deducted
as elements of the cost-price. The wear and tear of machinery, and of fixed
capital in general, must be made good in money. And finally comes profit, which
is calculated on this sum, expressed as costs either in actual money or in
money of account. This profit is represented by a definite portion of the gross
product, which is determined by its price. And the excess portion which then
remains forms rent. If the rent in kind stipulated by contract is greater than
this remainder determined by the price, then it does not constitute rent, but a
deduction from profit. Owing to this possibility alone, rent in kind is an
obsolete form, in so far as it does not reflect the price of the product, but
may be greater or smaller than the real rent, and thus may comprise not only a
deduction from profit, but also from those elements required for capital
replacement. In fact, this rent in kind, so far as it is rent not merely in
name but also in essence, is exclusively determined by the excess of the price
of the product over its price of production. Only it presupposes that this
variable is a constant magnitude. But it is such a comforting reflection that
the product in kind should suffice, first, to maintain the labourer, secondly,
to leave the capitalist tenant farmer more food than he needs, and finally,
that the remainder should constitute the natural rent. Quite like a
manufacturer producing 200,000 yards of cotton goods. These yards of goods not
only suffice to clothe his labourers; to clothe his wife, all his offspring and
himself abundantly; but also leave over enough cotton for sale, in addition to
paying an enormous rent in terms of cotton goods. It is all so simple! Deduct
the price of production from 200,000 yards of cotton goods, and a surplus of
cotton goods must remain for rent. But it is indeed a naive conception to
deduct the price of production of, say, £10,000 from 200,000 yards of cotton
goods, without knowing the selling price, to deduct money from cotton goods, to
deduct an exchange-value from a use-value as such, and thus to determine the
surplus of yards of cotton goods over pounds sterling. It is worse than
squaring the circle, which is at least based upon the conception that there is
a limit at which straight lines and curves imperceptibly flow together. But
such is the prescription of M. Passy. Deduct money from cotton goods, before
the cotton goods have been converted into money, either in one’s mind or
in reality! What remains is the rent, which, however, is to be grasped
<i>naturaliter</i> (see, for instance, Karl Arnd [K. Arnd, <i>Die
naturgemässe Volkswirtschaft, gegenüber dem Monopoliengeiste und dem
Communismus</i>, Hanau, 1845, S. 461-62. — <i>Ed</i>.]) and not by
deviltries of sophistry. The entire restoration of rent in kind is finally
reduced to this foolishness, the deduction of the price of production from so
many and so many bushels of wheat, and the subtraction of a sum of money from a
cubic measure.</p>
<a id="2"></a>
<h5>II. Labour rent</h5>
<p>If we consider ground-rent in its simplest form, that of <i>labour
rent,</i> where the direct producer, using instruments of labour (plough,
cattle, etc.) which actually or legally belong to him, cultivates soil actually
owned by him during part of the week, and works during the remaining days upon
the estate of the feudal lord without any compensation from the feudal lord,
the situation here is still quite clear, for in this case rent and
surplus-value are identical. Rent, not profit, is the form here through which
unpaid surplus-labour expresses itself. To what extent the labourer (a
self-sustaining serf) can secure in this case a surplus above his indispensable
necessities of life, i.e., a surplus above that which we would call wages under
the capitalist mode of production, depends, other circumstances remaining
unchanged, upon the proportion in which his labour-time is divided into
labour-time for himself and enforced labour-time for his feudal lord. This
surplus above the indispensable requirements of life, the germ of what appears
as profit under the capitalist mode of production, is therefore wholly
determined by the amount of ground-rent, which in this case is not only
directly unpaid surplus-labour, but also appears as such. It is unpaid
surplus-labour for the "owner" of the means of production, which here coincide
with the land, and so far as they differ from it, are mere accessories to it.
That the product of the serf must here suffice to reproduce his conditions of
labour, in addition to his subsistence, is a circumstance which remains the
same under all modes of production. For it is not the result of their specific
form, but a natural requisite of all continuous and reproductive labour in
general, of any continuing production, which is always simultaneously
reproduction, i.e., including reproduction of its own operating conditions. It
is furthermore evident that in all forms in which the direct labourer remains
the "possessor" of the means of production and labour conditions necessary for
the production of his own means of subsistence, the property relationship must
simultaneously appear as a direct relation of lordship and servitude, so that
the direct producer is not free; a lack of freedom which may be reduced from
serfdom with enforced labour to a mere tributary relationship. The direct
producer, according to our assumption, is to be found here in possession of his
own means of production, the necessary material labour conditions required for
the realisation of his labour and the production of his means of subsistence.
He conducts his agricultural activity and the rural home industries connected
with it independently. This independence is not undermined by the circumstance
that the small peasants may form among themselves a more or less natural
production community, as they do in India, since it is here merely a question
of independence from the nominal lord of the manor. Under such conditions the
surplus-labour for the nominal owner of the land can only be extorted from them
by other than economic pressure, whatever the form assumed may be.<a href="#r44" id="n44"><sup class="enote">[44]</sup></a> This differs from
slave or plantation economy in that the slave works under alien conditions of
production and not independently. Thus, conditions of personal dependence are
requisite, a lack of personal freedom, no matter to what extent, and being tied
to the soil as its accessory, bondage in the true sense of the word. Should the
direct producers not be confronted by a private landowner, but rather, as in
Asia, under direct subordination to a state which stands over them as their
landlord and simultaneously as sovereign, then rent and taxes coincide, or
rather, there exists no tax which differs from this form of ground-rent. Under
such circumstances, there need exist no stronger political or economic pressure
than that common to all subjection to that state. The state is then the supreme
lord. Sovereignty here consists in the ownership of land concentrated on a
national scale. But, on the other hand, no private ownership of land exists,
although there is both private and common possession and use of land.</p>
<p>The specific economic form, in which unpaid surplus-labour is pumped out of
direct producers, determines the relationship of rulers and ruled, as it grows
directly out of production itself and, in turn, reacts upon it as a determining
element. Upon this, however, is founded the entire formation of the economic
community which grows up out of the production relations themselves, thereby
simultaneously its specific political form. It is always the direct
relationship of the owners of the conditions of production to the direct
producers — a relation always naturally corresponding to a definite stage
in the development of the methods of labour and thereby its social productivity
— which reveals the innermost secret, the hidden basis of the entire
social structure and with it the political form of the relation of sovereignty
and dependence, in short, the corresponding specific form of the state. This
does not prevent the same economic basis — the same from the standpoint
of its main conditions — due to innumerable different empirical
circumstances, natural environment, racial relations, external historical
influences, etc. from showing infinite variations and gradations in appearance,
which can be ascertained only by analysis of the empirically given
circumstances.</p>
<p>So much is evident with respect to labour rent, the simplest and most
primitive form of rent: Rent is here the primeval form of surplus-labour and
coincides with it. But this identity of surplus-value with unpaid labour of
others need not be analysed here because it still exists in its visible,
palpable form, since the labour of the direct producer for himself is still
separated in space and time from his labour for the landlord and the latter
appears directly in the brutal form of enforced labour for a third person. In
the same way the "attribute" possessed by the soil to produce rent is here
reduced to a tangibly open secret, for the disposition to furnish rent here
also includes human labour-power bound to the soil, and the property relation
which compels the owner of labour-power to drive it on and activate it beyond
such measure as is required to satisfy his own indispensable needs. Rent
consists directly in the appropriation of this surplus expenditure of
labour-power by the landlord; for the direct producer pays him no additional
rent. Here, where surplus-value and rent are not only identical but where
surplus-value has the tangible form of surplus-labour, the natural conditions
or limits of rent, being those of surplus-value in general, are plainly clear.
The direct producer must 1) possess enough labour-power, and 2) the natural
conditions of his labour, above all the soil cultivated by him, must be
productive enough, in a word, the natural productivity of his labour must be
big enough to give him the possibility of retaining some surplus-labour over
and above that required for the satisfaction of his own indispensable needs. It
is not this possibility which creates the rent, but rather compulsion which
turns this possibility into reality. But the possibility itself is conditioned
by subjective and objective natural circumstances. And here too lies nothing at
all mysterious. Should labour-power be minute, and the natural conditions of
labour scanty, then the surplus-labour is small, but in such a case so are the
wants of the producers on the one hand and the relative number of exploiters of
surplus-labour on the other, and finally so is the surplus-product, whereby
this barely productive surplus-labour is realised for those few exploiting
landowners.</p>
<p>Finally, labour rent in itself implies that, all other circumstances
remaining equal, it will depend wholly upon the relative amount of
surplus-labour, or enforced labour, to what extent the direct producer shall be
enabled to improve his own condition, to acquire wealth, to produce an excess
over and above his indispensable means of subsistence, or, if we wish to
anticipate the capitalist mode of expression, whether he shall be able to
produce a profit for himself, and how much of a profit, i.e., an excess over
his wages which have been produced by himself. Rent here is the normal,
all-absorbing, so to say legitimate form of surplus-labour, and far from being
excess over profit, which means in this case being above any other excess over
wages, it is rather that the amount of such profit, and even its very
existence, depends, other circumstances being equal, upon the amount of rent,
i.e., the enforced surplus-labour to be surrendered to the landowners.</p>
<p>Since the direct producer is not the owner, but only a possessor, and since
all his surplus-labour <i>de jure</i> actually belongs to the landlord, some
historians have expressed astonishment that it should be at all possible for
those subject to enforced labour, or serfs, to acquire any independent
property, or relatively speaking, wealth, under such circumstances. However, it
is evident that tradition must play a dominant role in the primitive and
undeveloped circumstances on which these social production relations and the
corresponding mode of production are based. It is furthermore clear that here
as always it is in the interest of the ruling section of society to sanction
the existing order as law and to legally establish its limits given through
usage and tradition. Apart from all else, this, by the way, comes about of
itself as soon as the constant reproduction of the basis of the existing order
and its fundamental relations assumes a regulated and orderly form in the
course of time. And such regulation and order are themselves indispensable
elements of any mode of production, if it is to assume social stability and
independence from mere chance and arbitrariness. These are precisely the form
of its social stability and therefore its relative freedom from mere
arbitrariness and mere chance. Under backward conditions of the production
process as well as the corresponding social relations, it achieves this form by
mere repetition of their very reproduction. If this has continued on for some
time, it entrenches itself as custom and tradition and is finally sanctioned as
an explicit law. However, since the form of this surplus-labour, enforced
labour, is based upon the imperfect development of all social productive powers
and the crudeness of the methods of labour itself, it will naturally absorb a
relatively much smaller portion of the direct producer’s total labour
than under developed modes of production, particularly the capitalist mode of
production. Take it, for instance, that the enforced labour for the landlord
originally amounted to two days per week. These two days of enforced labour per
week are thereby fixed, are a constant magnitude, legally regulated by
prescriptive or written law. But the productivity of the remaining days of the
week, which are at the disposal of the direct producer himself, is a variable
magnitude, which must develop in the course of his experience, just as the new
wants he acquires, and just as the expansion of the market for his product and
the increasing assurance with which he disposes of this portion of his
labour-power will spur him on to a greater exertion of his labour-power,
whereby it should not be forgotten that the employment of his labour-power is
by no means confined to agriculture, but includes rural home industry. The
possibility is here presented for definite economic development taking place,
depending, of course, upon favourable circumstances, inborn racial
characteristics, etc.</p>
<a id="3"></a>
<h5>III. Rent In Kind</h5>
<p>The transformation of labour rent into rent in kind changes nothing from the
economic standpoint in the nature of ground-rent. The latter consists, in the
forms considered here, in that rent is the sole prevailing and normal form of
surplus-value, or surplus-labour. This is further expressed in the fact that it
is the only surplus-labour, or the only surplus-product, which the direct
producer, who is in <i>possession</i> of the labour conditions needed for his
own reproduction, must give up to the <i>owner</i> of the land, which in this
situation is the all-embracing condition of labour. And, furthermore, that land
is the only condition of labour which confronts the direct producer as alien
property, independent of him, and personified by the landlord. To whatever
extent rent in kind is the prevailing and dominant form of ground-rent, it is
further-more always more or less accompanied by survivals of the earlier form,
i.e., of rent paid directly in labour, corvée-labour, no matter whether the
landlord be a private person or the state. Rent in kind presupposes a higher
stage of civilisation for the direct producer, i.e., a higher level of
development of his labour and of society in general. And it is distinct from
the preceding form in that surplus-labour needs no longer be performed in its
natural form, thus no longer under the direct supervision and compulsion of the
landlord or his representatives: the direct producer is driven rather by force
of circumstances than by direct coercion, through legal enactment rather than
the whip, to perform it on his own responsibility. Surplus-production, in the
sense of production beyond the indispensable needs of the direct producer, and
within the field of production actually belonging to him, upon the land
exploited by himself instead of, as earlier, upon the nearby lord’s
estate beyond his own land, has already become a self-understood rule here. In
this relation the direct producer more or less disposes of his entire
labour-time, although, as previously, a part of this labour-time, at first
practically the entire surplus portion of it, belongs to the landlord without
compensation; except that the landlord no longer directly receives this
surplus-labour in its natural form, but rather in the products’ natural
form in which it is realised. The burdensome, and according to the way in which
enforced labour is regulated, more or less disturbing interruption by work for
the landlord (see Buch I, Kap. VIII, 2) [English edition Ch X, 2 —
<i>Ed</i>] ("Manufacturer and Boyard") stops wherever rent in kind appears in
pure form, or at least it is reduced to a few short intervals during the year,
when a continuation of some corvée-labour side by side with rent in kind takes
place. The labour of the producer for himself and his labour for the landlord
are no longer palpably separated by time and space. This rent in kind, in its
pure form, while it may drag fragments along into more highly developed modes
of production and production relations, still presupposes for its existence a
natural economy, i.e., that the conditions of the economy are either wholly or
for the overwhelming part produced by the economy itself, directly replaced and
reproduced out of its gross product. It furthermore presupposes the combination
of rural home industry with agriculture. The surplus-product, which forms the
rent, is the product of this combined agricultural and industrial family
labour, no matter whether rent in kind contains more or less of the industrial
product, as is often the case in the Middle Ages, or whether it is paid only in
the form of actual products of the land. In this form of rent it is by no means
necessary for rent in kind, which represents the surplus-labour, to fully
exhaust the entire surplus-labour of the rural family. Compared with labour
rent, the producer rather has more room for action to gain time for
surplus-labour whose product shall belong to himself, as well as the product of
his labour which satisfies his indispensable needs. Similarly, this form will
give rise to greater differences in the economic position of the individual
direct producers. At least the possibility for such a differentiation exists,
and the possibility for the direct producer to have in turn acquired the means
to exploit other labourers directly. This, however, does not concern us here,
since we are dealing with rent in kind in its pure form; just as in general we
cannot enter into the endless variety of combinations wherein the various forms
of rent may be united, adulterated and amalgamated. The form of rent in kind,
by being bound to a definite type of product and production itself and through
its indispensable combination of agriculture and domestic industry, through its
almost complete self-sufficiency whereby the peasant family supports itself
through its independence from the market and the movement of production and
history of that section of society lying outside of its sphere, in short owing
to the character of natural economy in general, this form is quite adapted to
furnishing the basis for stationary social conditions as we see, e.g., in Asia.
Here, as in the earlier form of labour rent, ground-rent is the normal form of
surplus-value, and thus of surplus-labour, i.e., of the entire excess labour
which the direct producer must perform gratis, hence actually under compulsion
although this compulsion no longer confronts him in the old brutal form —
for the benefit of the owner of his essential condition of labour, the land.
The profit, if by erroneously anticipating we may thus call that portion of the
direct producer’s labour excess over his necessary labour, which he
retains for himself, has so little to do with determining rent in kind, that
this profit, on the contrary, grows up behind the back of rent and finds its
natural limit in the size of rent in kind. The latter may assume dimensions
which seriously imperil reproduction of the conditions of labour, the means of
production themselves, rendering the expansion of production more or less
impossible and reducing the direct producers to the physical minimum of means
of subsistence. This is particularly the case, when this form is met with and
exploited by a conquering commercial nation, e.g., the English in India.</p>
<a id="4"></a>
<h5>IV. Money-Rent</h5>
<p>By money-rent — as distinct from industrial and commercial ground-rent
based upon the capitalist mode of production, which is but an excess over
average profit — we here mean the ground-rent which arises from a mere
change in form of rent in kind, just as the latter in turn is but a
modification of labour rent. The direct producer here turns over instead of the
product, its price to the landlord (who may be either the state or a private
individual). An excess of products in their natural form no longer suffices; it
must be converted from its natural form into money-form. Although the direct
producer still continues to produce at least the greater part of his means of
subsistence himself, a certain portion of this product must now be converted
into commodities, must be produced as commodities. The character of the entire
mode of production is thus more or less changed. It loses its independence, its
detachment from social connection. The ratio of cost of production, which now
comprises greater or lesser expenditures of money, becomes decisive; at any
rate, the excess of that portion of gross product to be converted into money
over that portion which must serve, on the one hand, as means of reproduction
again, and, on the other, as means of direct subsistence, assumes a determining
role. However, the basis of this type of rent, although approaching its
dissolution, remains the same as that of rent in kind, which constitutes its
point of departure. The direct producer as before is still possessor of the
land either through inheritance or some other traditional right, and must
perform for his lord, as owner of his most essential condition of production,
excess corvée-labour, that is, unpaid labour for which no equivalent is
returned, in the form of a surplus-product transformed into money. Ownership of
the conditions of labour as distinct from land, such as agricultural implements
and other goods and chattels, is transformed into the property of the direct
producer even under the earlier forms of rent, first in fact, and then also
legally, and even more so is this the precondition for the form of money-rent.
The transformation of rent in kind into money-rent, taking place first
sporadically and then on a more or less national scale, presupposes a
considerable development of commerce, of urban industry, of
commodity-production in general, and thereby of money circulation. It
furthermore assumes a market-price for products, and that they be sold at
prices roughly approximating their values, which need not at all be the case
under earlier forms. In Eastern Europe we may still partly observe this
transformation taking place under our very eyes. How unfeasible it can be
without a certain development of social labour productivity is proved by
various unsuccessful attempts to carry it through under the Roman Empire, and
by relapses into rent in kind after seeking to convert at least the state tax
portion of this rent into money-rent. The same transitional difficulties are
evidenced, e.g., in pre-revolutionary France, when money-rent was combined with
and adulterated by, survivals of its earlier forms.</p>
<p>Money-rent, as a transmuted form of rent in kind, and in antithesis to it,
is, nevertheless, the final form, and simultaneously the form of dissolution of
the type of ground-rent which we have heretofore considered, namely ground-rent
as the normal form of surplus-value and of the unpaid surplus-labour to be
performed for the owner of the conditions of production. In its pure form, this
rent, like labour rent and rent in kind, represents no excess over profit. It
absorbs the profit, as it is understood. In so far as profit arises beside it
practically as a separate portion of excess labour, money-rent like rent in its
earlier forms still constitutes the normal limit of such embryonic profit,
which can only develop in relation to the possibilities of exploitation, be it
of one’s own excess labour or that of another, which remains after the
performance of the surplus-labour represented by money-rent. Should any profit
actually arise along with this rent, then this profit does not constitute the
limit of rent, but rather conversely, the rent is the limit of the profit.
However, as already indicated, money-rent is simultaneously the form of
dissolution of the ground-rent considered thus far, coinciding <i>prima
facie</i> with surplus-value and surplus-labour, i.e., ground-rent as the
normal and dominant form of surplus-value.</p>
<p>In its further development money-rent must lead — aside from all
intermediate forms, e.g., the small peasant tenant farmer — either to the
transformation of land into peasants’ freehold, or to the form
corresponding to the capitalist mode of production, that is, to rent paid by
the capitalist tenant farmer.</p>
<p>With money-rent prevailing, the traditional and customary legal relationship
between landlord and subjects who possess and cultivate a part of the land, is
necessarily turned into a pure money relationship fixed contractually in
accordance with the rules of positive law. The possessor engaged in cultivation
thus becomes virtually a mere tenant. This transformation serves on the one
hand, provided other general production relations permit, to expropriate more
and more the old peasant possessors and to substitute capitalist tenants in
their stead. On the other hand, it leads to the former possessor buying himself
free from his rent obligation and to his transformation into an independent
peasant with complete ownership of the land he tills. The transformation of
rent in kind into money-rent is furthermore not only inevitably accompanied,
but even anticipated, by the formation of a class of propertyless
day-labourers, who hire themselves out for money. During their genesis, when
this new class appears but sporadically, the custom necessarily develops among
the more prosperous peasants subject to rent payments of exploiting
agricultural wage-labourers for their own account, much as in feudal times,
when the more well-to-do peasant serfs themselves also held serfs. In this way,
they gradually acquire the possibility of accumulating a certain amount of
wealth and themselves becoming transformed into future capitalists. The old
self-employed possessors of land themselves thus give rise to a nursery school
for capitalist tenants, whose development is conditioned by the general
development of capitalist production beyond the bounds of the country-side.
This class shoots up very rapidly when particularly favourable circumstances
come to its aid, as in England in the 16th century, where the then progressive
depreciation of money enriched them under the customary long leases at the
expense of the landlords.</p>
<p>Furthermore: as soon as rent assumes the form of money-rent, and thereby the
relationship between rent-paying peasant and landlord becomes a relationship
fixed by contract — a development which is only possible generally when
the world-market, commerce and manufacture have reached a certain relatively
high level — the leasing of land to capitalists inevitably also makes its
appearance. The latter hitherto stood beyond the rural limits and now carry
over to the countryside and agriculture the capital acquired in the cities and
with it the capitalist mode of operation developed — i.e., creating a
product as a mere commodity and solely as a means of appropriating
surplus-value. This form can become the general rule only in those countries
which dominate the world-market in the period of transition from the feudal to
the capitalist mode of production. When the capitalist tenant farmer steps in
between landlord and actual tiller of the soil, all relations which arose out
of the old rural mode of production are torn asunder. The farmer becomes the
actual commander of these agricultural labourers and the actual exploiter of
their surplus-labour, whereas the landlord maintains a direct relationship, and
indeed simply a money and contractual relationship, solely with this capitalist
tenant. Thus, the nature of rent is also transformed, not merely in fact and by
chance, as occurred in part even under earlier forms, but normally, in its
recognised and prevailing form. From the normal form of surplus-value and
surplus-labour, it descends to a mere excess of this surplus-labour over that
portion of it appropriated by the exploiting capitalist in the form of profit;
just as the total surplus-labour, profit and excess over profit, is extracted
directly by him, collected in the form of the total surplus-product, and turned
into cash. It is only the excess portion of this surplus-value which is
extracted by him from the agricultural labourer by direct exploitation, by
means of his capital, which he turns over to the landlord as rent. How much or
how little he turns over to the latter depends, on the average, upon the limits
set by the average profit which is realised by capital in the non-agricultural
spheres of production, and by the prices of non-agricultural production
regulated by this average profit. From a normal form of surplus-value and
surplus-labour, rent has now become transformed into an excess over that
portion of the surplus-labour claimed in advance by capital as its legitimate
and normal share, and characteristic of this particular sphere of production,
the agricultural sphere of production. Profit, instead of rent, has now become
the normal form of surplus-value and rent still exists solely as a form, not of
surplus-value in general, but of one of its offshoots, surplus-profit, which
assumes an independent form under particular circumstances. It is not necessary
to elaborate the manner in which a gradual transformation in the mode of
production itself corresponds to this transformation. This already follows from
the fact that it is normal for the capitalist tenant farmer to produce
agricultural products as commodities, and that, while formerly only the excess
over his means of subsistence was converted into commodities, now but a
relatively insignificant part of these commodities is directly used by him as
means of subsistence. It is no longer the land, but rather capital, which has
now brought even agricultural labour under its direct sway and
productiveness.</p>
<p>The average profit and the price of production regulated thereby are formed
outside of relations in the country-side and within the sphere of urban trade
and manufacture. The profit of the rent-paying peasant does not enter into it
as an equalising factor, for his relation to the landlord is not a capitalist
one. In so far as he makes profit, i.e., realises an excess above his necessary
means of subsistence, either by his own labour or through exploiting other
people’s labour, it is done behind the back of the normal relationship,
and other circumstances being equal, the size of this profit does not determine
rent, but on the contrary, it is determined by the rent as its limit. The high
rate of profit in the Middle Ages is not entirely due to the low composition of
capital, in which the variable component invested in wages predominates. It is
due to swindling on the land, the appropriation of a portion of the
landlord’s rent and of the income of his vassals. If the country-side
exploits the town politically in the Middle Ages, wherever feudalism has not
been broken down by exceptional urban development — as in Italy, the
town, on the other hand, exploits the land economically everywhere and without
exception, through its monopoly prices, its system of taxation, its guild
organisation, its direct commercial fraudulence and its usury.</p>
<p>One might imagine that the mere appearance of the capitalist farmer in
agricultural production would prove that the price of agricultural products,
which from time immemorial have paid rent in one form or another, must be
higher, at least at the time of this appearance, than the prices of production
of manufacture whether it be because the price of such agricultural products
has reached a monopoly price level, or has risen as high as the value of the
agricultural products, and their value actually is above the price of
production regulated by the average profit. For were this not so, the
capitalist farmer could not at all realise, at the existing prices of
agricultural produce, first the average profit out of the price of these
products, and then pay out of the same price an excess above this profit in the
form of rent. One might conclude from this that the general rate of profit,
which guides the capitalist farmer in his contract with the landlord, has been
formed without including rent, and, therefore, as soon as it assumes a
regulating role in agricultural production, it finds this excess at hand and
pays it to the landlord. It is in this traditional manner that, for instance,
Herr Rodbertus explains the matter. [J. Rodbertus, <i>Sociale Briefe an von
Kirchmann, Dritter Brief: Widerlegung der Ricardo’schen Lehre von der
Grundrente und Begründung einer neuen Rententheorie.</i> See also K. Marx,
<i>Theorien über den Mehrwert.</i> 2. Teil, <i>1957, pp. </i>3-106, 142-54.
— <i>Ed.</i>] But:</p>
<p><i>First</i>. This appearance of capital as an independent and leading
force in agriculture does not take place all at once and generally, but
gradually and in particular lines of production. It encompasses at first, not
agriculture proper, but such branches of production as cattle-breeding,
especially sheep-raising, whose principal product, wool, offers at the early
stages a constant excess of market-price over price of production during the
rise of industry, and this does not level out until later. Thus in England
during the 16th century.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>. Since this capitalist production appears at first but
sporadically, the assumption cannot be disputed that it first extends only to
such land categories as are able, through their particular fertility, or their
exceptionally favourable location, to generally pay a differential rent.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>. Let us even assume that at the time this mode of
production appeared — and this indeed presupposes an increasing
preponderance of urban demand — the prices of agricultural products were
higher than the price of production, as was doubtless the case in England
during the last third of the 17th century. Nevertheless, as soon as this mode
of production has somewhat extricated itself from the mere subordination of
agriculture to capital, and as soon as agricultural improvement and the
reduction of production costs, which necessarily accompany its development,
have taken place, the balance will be restored by a reaction, a fall in the
price of agricultural produce, as happened in England in the first half of the
18th century.</p>
<p>Rent, thus, as an excess over the average profit cannot be explained in this
traditional way. Whatever may be the existing historical circumstances at the
time rent first appears, once it has struck root it cannot exist except under
the modern conditions earlier described.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted in the transformation of rent in kind into
money-rent that along with it capitalised rent, or the price of land, and thus
its alienability and alienation become essential factors, and that thereby not
only can the former peasant subject to payment of rent be transformed into an
independent peasant proprietor, but also urban and other moneyed people can buy
real estate in order to lease it either to peasants or capitalists and thus
enjoy rent as a form of interest on their capital so invested; that, therefore,
this circumstance likewise facilitates the transformation of the former mode of
exploitation, the relation between owner and actual cultivator of the land, and
of rent itself.</p>
<a id="5"></a>
<h5>V. Métayage And Peasant Proprietorship Of Land Parcels</h5>
<p>We have now arrived at the end of our elaboration of ground-rent.</p>
<p>In all these forms of ground-rent, whether labour rent, rent in kind, or
money-rent (as merely a changed form of rent in kind), the one paying rent is
always supposed to be the actual cultivator and possessor of the land, whose
unpaid surplus-labour passes directly into the hands of the landlord. Even in
the last form, money-rent in so far as it is "pure," i.e., merely a changed
form of rent in kind — this is not only possible, but actually takes
place.</p>
<p>As a transitory form from the original form of rent to capitalist rent, we
may consider the metayer system, or share-cropping, under which the manager
(farmer) furnishes labour (his own or another’s), and also a portion of
working capital, and the landlord furnishes, aside from land, another portion
of working capital (e.g., cattle), and the product is divided between tenant
and landlord in definite proportions which vary from country to country. On the
one hand, the farmer here lacks sufficient capital required for complete
capitalist management. On the other hand, the share here appropriated by the
landlord does not bear the pure form of rent. It may actually include interest
on the capital advanced by him and an excess rent. It may also absorb
practically the entire surplus-labour of the farmer, or leave him a greater or
smaller portion of this surplus-labour. But, essentially, rent no longer
appears here as the normal form of surplus-value in general. On the one hand,
the sharecropper, whether he employs his own or another’s labour, is to
lay claim to a portion of the product not in his capacity as labourer, but as
possessor of part of the instruments of labour, as his own capitalist. On the
other hand, the landlord claims his share not exclusively on the basis of his
land-ownership, but also as lender of capital.<a href="#n44a" id="r44a"><sup class="enote">[44a]</sup></a></p>
<p>A survival of the old communal ownership of land, which had endured after
the transition to independent peasant farming, e.g., in Poland and Rumania,
served there as a subterfuge for effecting a transition to the lower forms of
ground-rent. A portion of the land belongs to the individual peasant and is
tilled independently by him. Another portion is tilled in common and creates a
surplus-product, which serves partly to cover community expenses, partly as a
reserve in cases of crop failure, etc. These last two parts of the
surplus-product, and ultimately the entire surplus-product including the land
upon which it has been grown, are more and more usurped by state officials and
private individuals, and thus the originally free peasant proprietors, whose
obligation to till this land in common is maintained, are transformed into
vassals subject either to corvée-labour or rent in kind; while the usurpers of
common land are transformed into owners, not only of the usurped common lands,
but even the very lands of the peasants themselves.</p>
<p>We need not further investigate slave economy proper (which likewise passes
through a metamorphosis from the patriarchal system mainly for home use to the
plantation system for the world-market) nor the management of estates under
which the landlords themselves are independent cultivators, possessing all
instruments of production, and exploiting the labour of free or unfree
bondsmen, who are paid either in kind or money. Landlord and owner of the
instruments of production, and thus the direct exploiter of labourers included
among these elements of production, are in this case one and the same person.
Rent and profit likewise coincide then, there occurring no separation of the
different forms of surplus-value. The entire surplus-labour of the labourers,
which is manifested here in the surplus-product, is extracted from them
directly by the owner of all instruments of production, to which belong the
land and, under the original form of slavery, the immediate producers
themselves. Where the capitalist outlook prevails, as on American plantations,
this entire surplus-value is regarded as profit; where neither the capitalist
mode of production itself exists, nor the corresponding outlook has been
transferred from capitalist countries, it appears as rent. At any rate, this
form presents no difficulties. The income of the landlord, whatever it may be
called, the available surplus-product appropriated by him, is here the normal
and prevailing form, whereby the entire unpaid surplus-labour is directly
appropriated, and landed property forms the basis of such appropriation.</p>
<p>Further, <i>proprietorship of land parcels.</i> The peasant here is
simultaneously the free owner of his land, which appears as his principal
instrument of production, the indispensable field of employment for his labour
and his capital. No lease money is paid under this form. Rent, therefore, does
not appear as a separate form of surplus-value, although in countries in which
otherwise the capitalist mode of production is developed, it appears as a
surplus-profit compared with other lines of production; but as surplus-profit
which, like all proceeds of his labour in general, accrues to the peasant.</p>
<p>This form of landed property presupposes, as in the earlier older forms,
that the rural population greatly predominates numerically over the town
population, so that, even if the capitalist mode of production otherwise
prevails, it is but relatively little developed, and thus also in the other
lines of production the concentration of capital is restricted to narrow limits
and a fragmentation of capital predominates. In the nature of things, the
greater portion of agricultural produce must be consumed as direct means of
subsistence by the producers themselves, the peasants, and only the excess
above that will find its way as commodities into urban commerce. No matter how
the average market-price of agricultural products may here be regulated,
differential rent, an excess portion of commodity-prices from superior or more
favourably located land, must evidently exist here much as under the capitalist
mode of production. This differential rent exists, even where this form appears
under social conditions, under which no general market-price has as yet been
developed; it appears then in the excess surplus-product. Only then it flows
into the pockets of the peasant whose labour is realised under more favourable
natural conditions. The assumption here is generally to be made that no
absolute rent exists, i.e., that the worst soil does not pay any rent —
precisely under this form where the price of land enters as a factor in the
peasant’s actual cost of production whether because in the course of this
form’s further development either the price of land has been computed at
a certain money-value, in dividing up an inheritance, or, during the constant
change in ownership of an entire estate, or of its component parts, the land
has been bought by the cultivator himself, largely by raising money on
mortgage; and, therefore, where the price of land, representing nothing more
than capitalised rent, is a factor assumed in advance, and where rent thus
seems to exist independently of any differentiation in fertility and location
of the land. For, absolute rent presupposes either realised excess in product
value above its price of production, or a monopoly price exceeding the value of
the product. But since agriculture here is carried on largely as cultivation
for direct subsistence, and the land exists as an indispensable field of
employment for the labour and capital of the majority of the population, the
regulating market-price of the product will reach its value only under
extraordinary circumstances. But this value will, generally, be higher than its
price of production owing to the preponderant element of living labour,
although this excess of value over price of production will in turn be limited
by the low composition even of non-agricultural capital in countries with an
economy composed predominantly of land parcels. For the peasant owning a
parcel, the limit of exploitation is not set by the average profit of capital,
in so far as he is a small capitalist; nor, on the other hand, by the necessity
of rent, in so far as he is a landowner. The absolute limit for him as a small
capitalist is no more than the wages he pays to himself, after deducting his
actual costs. So long as the price of the product covers these wages, he will
cultivate his land, and often at wages down to a physical minimum. As for his
capacity as land proprietor, the barrier of ownership is eliminated for him,
since it can make itself felt only <i>vis-à-vis</i> a capital (including
labour) separated from land-ownership, by erecting an obstacle to the
investment of capital. It is true, to be sure, that interest on the price of
land — which generally has to be paid to still another individual, the
mortgage creditor — is a barrier. But this interest can be paid precisely
out of that portion of surplus-labour which would constitute profit under
capitalist conditions. The rent anticipated in the price of land and in the
interest paid for it can therefore be nothing but a portion of the
peasant’s capitalised surplus-labour over and above the labour
indispensable for his subsistence, without this surplus-labour being realised
in a part of the commodity-value equal to the entire average profit, and still
less in an excess above the surplus-labour realised in the average profit,
i.e., in a surplus-profit. The rent may be a deduction from the average profit,
or even the only portion of it which is realised. For the peasant parcel holder
to cultivate his land, or to buy land for cultivation, it is therefore not
necessary, as under the normal capitalist mode of production, that the
market-price of the agricultural products rise high enough to afford him the
average profit, and still less a fixed excess above this average profit in the
form of rent. It is not necessary, therefore, that the market-price rise,
either up to the value or the price of production of his product. This is one
of the reasons why grain prices are lower in countries with predominant small
peasant land proprietorship than in countries with a capitalist mode of
production. One portion of the surplus-labour of the peasants, who work under
the least favourable conditions, is bestowed gratis upon society and does not
at all enter into the regulation of price of production or into the creation of
value in general. This lower price is consequently a result of the
producers’ poverty and by no means of their labour productivity.</p>
<p>This form of free self-managing peasant proprietorship of land parcels as
the prevailing, normal form constitutes, on the one hand, the economic
foundation of society during the best periods of classical antiquity, and on
the other hand, it is found among modern nations as one of the forms arising
from the dissolution of feudal land ownership. Thus, the yeomanry in England,
the peasantry in Sweden, the French and West German peasants. We do not include
colonies here, since the independent peasant there develops under different
conditions.</p>
<p>The free ownership of the self-managing peasant is evidently the most normal
form of landed property for small-scale operation, i.e., for a mode of
production, in which possession of the land is a prerequisite for the
labourer’s ownership of the product of his own labour, and in which the
cultivator, be he free owner or vassal, always must produce his own means of
subsistence independently, as an isolated labourer with his family. Ownership
of the land is as necessary for full development of this mode of production as
ownership of tools is for free development of handicraft production. Here is
the basis for the development of personal independence. It is a necessary
transitional stage for the development of agriculture itself. The causes which
bring about its downfall show its limitations. These are: Destruction of rural
domestic industry, which forms its normal supplement as a result of the
development of large-scale industry; a gradual impoverishment and exhaustion of
the soil subjected to this cultivation; usurpation by big landowners of the
common lands, which constitute the second supplement of the management of land
parcels everywhere and which alone enable it to raise cattle; competition,
either of the plantation system or large-scale capitalist agriculture.
Improvements in agriculture, which on the one hand cause a fall in agricultural
prices and, on the other, require greater outlays and more extensive material
conditions of production, also contribute towards this, as in England during
the first half of the 18th century.</p>
<p>Proprietorship of land parcels by its very nature excludes the development
of social productive forces of labour, social forms of labour, social
concentration of capital, large-scale cattle-raising, and the progressive
application of science.</p>
<p>Usury and a taxation system must impoverish it everywhere. The expenditure
of capital in the price of the land withdraws this capital from cultivation. An
infinite fragmentation of means of production, and isolation of the producers
themselves. Monstrous waste of human energy. Progressive deterioration of
conditions of production and increased prices of means of production — an
inevitable law of proprietorship of parcels. Calamity of seasonal abundance for
this mode of production.<a href="#n45" id="r45"><sup class="enote">[45]</sup></a></p>
<p>One of the specific evils of small-scale agriculture where it is combined
with free land-ownership arises from the cultivator’s investing capital
in the purchase of land. (The same applies also to the transitory form, in
which the big landowner invests capital, first, to buy land, and second, to
manage it as his own tenant farmer.) Owing to the changeable nature which the
land here assumes as a mere commodity, the changes of ownership increase,<a href="#n46" id="r46"><sup class="enote">[46]</sup></a> so that the land, from
the peasant’s viewpoint, enters anew as an investment of capital with
each successive generation and division of estates, i.e., it becomes land
purchased by him. The price of land here forms a weighty element of the
individual unproductive costs of production or cost-price of the product for
the individual producer.</p>
<p>The price of land is nothing but capitalised and therefore anticipated rent.
If capitalist methods are employed by agriculture, so that the landlord
receives only rent, and the farmer pays nothing for land except this annual
rent, then it is evident that the capital invested by the landowner himself in
purchasing the land constitutes indeed an interest-bearing investment of
capital for him, but has absolutely nothing to do with capital invested in
agriculture itself. It forms neither a part of the fixed, nor of the
circulating, capital employed here;<a href="#n47" id="r47"><sup class="enote">[47]</sup></a> it merely secures for the buyer a claim to receive
annual rent, but has absolutely nothing to do with the production of the rent
itself. The buyer of land just pays his capital out to the one who sells the
land, and the seller in return relinquishes his ownership of the land. Thus
this capital no longer exists as the capital of the purchaser; he no longer has
it; therefore it does not belong to the capital which he can invest in any way
in the land itself. Whether he bought the land dear or cheap, or whether he
received it for nothing, alters nothing in the capital invested by the farmer
in his establishment, and changes nothing in the rent, but merely alters the
question whether it appears to him as interest or not, or as higher or lower
interest respectively.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, the slave economy. The price paid for a slave is nothing
but the anticipated and capitalised surplus-value or profit to be wrung out of
the slave. But the capital paid for the purchase of a slave does not belong to
the capital by means of which profit, surplus-labour, is extracted from him. On
the contrary. It is capital which the slave-holder has parted with, it is a
deduction from the capital which be has available for actual production. It has
ceased to exist for him, just as capital invested in purchasing land has ceased
to exist for agriculture. The best proof of this is that it does not reappear
for the slave-holder or the landowner except when he, in turn, sells his slaves
or land. But then the same situation prevails for the buyer. The fact that he
has bought the slave does not enable him to exploit the slave without further
ado. He is only able to do so when he invests some additional capital in the
slave economy itself.</p>
<p>The same capital does not exist twice, once in the hands of the seller, and
a second time in the hands of the buyer of the land. It passes from the hands
of the buyer to those of the seller, and there the matter ends. The buyer now
no longer has capital, but in its stead a piece of land. The circumstance that
the rent produced by a real investment of capital in this land is calculated by
the new landowner as interest on capital which he has not invested in the land,
but given away to acquire the land, does not in the least alter the economic
nature of the land factor, any more than the circumstance that someone has paid
£1,000 for 3% consols has anything to do with the capital out of whose revenue
the interest on the national debt is paid.</p>
<p>In fact, the money expended in purchasing land, like that in purchasing
government bonds, is merely capital <i>in itself,</i> just as any value sum
is capital in itself, potential capital, on the basis of the capitalist mode of
production. What is paid for land, like that for government bonds or any other
purchased commodity, is a sum of money. This is capital in itself, because it
can be converted into capital. It depends upon the use put to it by the seller
whether the money obtained by him is really transformed into capital or not.
For the buyer, it can never again function as such, no more than any other
money which he has definitely paid out. It figures in his accounts as
interest-bearing capital, because he considers the income, received as rent
from the land or as interest on state indebtedness, as interest on the money
which the purchase of the claim to this revenue has cost him. He can only
realise it as capital through resale. But then another, the new buyer, enters
the same relationship maintained by the former, and the money thus expended
cannot be transformed into actual capital for the expender through any change
of hands.</p>
<p>In the case of small landed property the illusion is fostered still more
that land itself possesses value and thus enters as capital into the price of
production of the product, much as machines or raw materials. But we have seen
that rent, and therefore capitalised rent, the price of land, can enter as a
determining factor into the price of agricultural products in only two cases.
First, when as a consequence of the composition of agricultural capital —
a capital which has nothing to do with the capital invested in purchasing land
— the value of the products of the soil is higher than their price of
production, and market conditions enable the landlord to realise this
difference. Second, when there is a monopoly price. And both are least of all
the case under the management of land parcels and small land-ownership because
precisely here production to a large extent satisfies the producers’ own
wants and is carried on independently of regulation by the average rate of
profit. Even where cultivation of land parcels is conducted upon leased land,
the lease money comprises, far more so than under any other conditions, a
portion of the profit and even a deduction from wages; this money is then only
a nominal rent, not rent as an independent category as opposed to wages and
profit.</p>
<p>The expenditure of money-capital for the purchase of land, then, is not an
investment of agricultural capital. It is a decrease <i>pro tanto</i> in the
capital which small peasants can employ in their own sphere of production. It
reduces <i>pro tanto</i> the size of their means of production and thereby
narrows the economic basis of reproduction. It subjects the small peasant to
the money-lender, since credit proper occurs but rarely in this sphere in
general. It is a hindrance to agriculture, even where such purchase takes place
in the case of large estates. It contradicts in fact the capitalist mode of
production, which is on the whole indifferent to whether the landowner is in
debt, no matter whether he has inherited or purchased his estate. The nature of
management of the leased estate itself is not altered whether the landowner
pockets the rent himself or whether he must pay it out to the holder of his
mortgage.</p>
<p>We have seen that, in the case of a given ground-rent, the price of land is
regulated by the interest rate. If the rate is low, then the price of land is
high, and vice versa. Normally, then, a high price of land and a low interest
rate should go hand in hand, so that if the peasant paid a high price for the
land in consequence of a low interest rate, the same low rate of interest
should also secure his working capital for him on easy credit terms. But in
reality, things turn out differently when peasant proprietorship of land
parcels is the prevailing form. In the first place, the general laws of credit
are not adapted to the farmer, since these laws presuppose a capitalist as the
producer. Secondly, where proprietorship of land parcels predominates —
we are not referring to colonies here — and the small peasant constitutes
the backbone of the nation, the formation of capital, i.e., social
reproduction, is relatively weak, and still weaker is the formation of loanable
money-capital, in the sense previously elaborated. This presupposes the
concentration and existence of a class of idle rich capitalists (Massie). [
[Massie] <i>An Essay on the Governing Causes of the Natural Rate of
Interest,</i> London, 1750, pp 23-24. — <i>Ed</i>] Thirdly, here where
the ownership of the land is a necessary condition for the existence of most
producers, and an indispensable field of investment for their capital, the
price of land is raised independently of the interest rate, and often in
inverse ratio to it, through the preponderance of the demand for landed
property over its supply. Land sold in parcels brings a far higher price in
such a case than when sold in large tracts, because here the number of small
buyers is large and that of large buyers is small (Bandes Noires, [Associations
of profiteers. — <i>Ed</i>.] Rubichon; Newman [Newman, <i>Lectures on
Political Economy,</i> London, 1851, pp. 180-81. — <i>Ed.</i>]). For
all these reasons, the price of land rises here with a relatively high rate of
interest. The relatively low interest, which the peasant derives here from the
outlay of capital for the purchase of land (Mounier), corresponds here, on the
other side, to the high usurious interest rate which he himself has to pay to
his mortgage creditors. The Irish system bears out the same thing, only in
another form.</p>
<p>The price of land, this element foreign to production in itself, may
therefore rise here to such a point that it makes production impossible
(Dombasle).</p>
<p>The fact that the price of land plays such a role, that purchase and sale,
the circulation of land as a commodity, develops to this degree, is practically
a result of the development of the capitalist mode of production in so far as a
commodity is here the general form of all products and all instruments of
production. On the other hand, this development takes place only where the
capitalist mode of production has a limited development and does not unfold all
of its peculiarities, because this rests precisely upon the fact that
agriculture is no longer, or not yet, subject to the capitalist mode of
production, but rather to one handed down from extinct forms of society. The
disadvantages of the capitalist mode of production, with its dependence of the
producer upon the money-price of his product, coincide here therefore with the
disadvantages occasioned by the imperfect development of the capitalist mode of
production. The peasant turns merchant and industrialist without the conditions
enabling him to produce his products as commodities.</p>
<p>The conflict between the price of land as an element in the producers’
cost-price and no element in the price of production (even though the rent
enters as a determining factor into the price of the agricultural product, the
capitalised rent, which is advanced for 20 years or more, by no means enters as
a determinant) is but one of the forms manifesting the general contradiction
between private land-ownership and a rational agriculture, the normal social
utilisation of the soil. But on the other hand, private land ownership, and
thereby expropriation of the direct producers from the land — private
land-ownership by the one, which implies lack of ownership by others — is
the basis of the capitalist mode of production.</p>
<p>Here, in small-scale agriculture, the price of land, a form and result of
private land-ownership, appears as a barrier to production itself. In
large-scale agriculture, and large estates operating on a capitalist basis,
ownership likewise acts as a barrier, because it limits the tenant farmer in
his productive investment of capital, which in the final analysis benefits not
him, but the landlord. In both forms, exploitation and squandering of the
vitality of the soil (apart from making exploitation dependent upon the
accidental and unequal circumstances of individual producers rather than the
attained level of social development) takes the place of conscious rational
cultivation of the soil as eternal communal property, an inalienable condition
for the existence and reproduction of a chain of successive generations of the
human race. In the case of small property, this results from the lack of means
and knowledge of applying the social labour productivity. In the case of large
property, it results from the exploitation of such means for the most rapid
enrichment of farmer and proprietor. In the case of both through dependence on
the market-price.</p>
<p>All critique of small landed property resolves itself in the final analysis
into a criticism of private ownership as a barrier and hindrance to
agriculture. And similarly all counter-criticism of large landed property. In
either case, of course, we leave aside all secondary political considerations.
This barrier and hindrance, which are erected by all private landed property
vis-à-vis agricultural production and the rational cultivation, maintenance and
improvement of the soil itself, develop on both sides merely in different
forms, and in wrangling over the specific forms of this evil its ultimate cause
is forgotten.</p>
<p>Small landed property presupposes that the overwhelming majority of the
population is rural, and that not social, but isolated labour predominates; and
that, therefore, under such conditions wealth and development of reproduction,
both of its material and spiritual prerequisites, are out of the question, and
thereby also the prerequisites for rational cultivation. On the other hand,
large landed property reduces the agricultural population to a constantly
falling minimum, and confronts it with a constantly growing industrial
population crowded together in large cities. It thereby creates conditions
which cause an irreparable break in the coherence of social interchange
prescribed by the natural laws of life. As a result, the vitality of the soil
is squandered, and this prodigality is carried by commerce far beyond the
borders of a particular state (Liebig). [ Liebig, <i>Die Chemie in ihrer
Anwendung auf Agricultur und Physiologie,</i> Braunschweig, 1862. —
<i>Ed</i>.]</p>
<p>While small landed property creates a class of barbarians standing halfway
outside of society, a class combining all the crudeness of primitive forms of
society with the anguish and misery of civilised countries, large landed
property undermines labour-power in the last region, where its prime energy
seeks refuge and stores up its strength as a reserve fund for the regeneration
of the vital force of nations — on the land itself. Large-scale industry
and large-scale mechanised agriculture work together. If originally
distinguished by the fact that the former lays waste and destroys principally
labour-power, hence the natural force of human beings, whereas the latter more
directly exhausts the natural vitality of the soil, they join hands in the
further course of development in that the industrial system in the countryside
also enervates the labourers, and industry and commerce on their part supply
agriculture with the means for exhausting the soil.</p>

Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations,</i> Aberdeen,
London, 1848, p. 44. — <i>Ed.</i>], for the landlord was simultaneously
a capitalist, just as Cato, for instance, was on his estates. But this
separation is precisely the prerequisite for the capitalist mode of production,
to whose conception the basis of slavery moreover stands in direct
contradiction.</p>

which someone invests at the Stock Exchange in purchasing stocks or government

"invested" in any branch of production. </p>

Revenues and their Sources</p>
<h1>Chapter 51. Distribution Relations and Production Relations</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>The new value added by the annual newly added labour — and thus also that
portion of the annual product in which this value is represented and which may
be drawn out of the total output and separated from it — is thus split into
three parts, which assume three different forms of revenue, into forms which
express one portion of this value as belonging or falling to the share of the
owner of labour-power, another portion to the owner of capital, and a third
portion to the owner of landed property. These, then, are relations, or forms of
distribution, for they express the relations under which the newly produced
total value is distributed among the owners of the various production factors.</p>
<p>From the common viewpoint these distribution relations appear as natural
relations, as relations arising directly from the nature of all social
production, from the laws of human production in general. It cannot, indeed, be
denied that pre-capitalist societies disclose other modes of distribution, but
the latter are interpreted as undeveloped, unperfected and disguised, not
reduced to their purest expression and their highest form and differently shaded
modes of the natural distribution relations.</p>
<p>The only correct aspect of this conception is: Assuming some form of social
production to exist (e.g., primitive Indian communities, or the more ingeniously
developed communism of the Peruvians), a distinction can always be made between
that portion of labour whose product is directly consumed individually by the
producers and their families and — aside from the part which is productively
consumed — that portion of labour which is invariably surplus-labour, whose
product serves constantly to satisfy the general social needs no matter how this
surplus-product may be divided, and no matter who may function as representative
of these social needs. Thus, the identity of the various modes of distribution
amounts merely to this: they are identical if we abstract from their differences
and specific forms and keep in mind only their unity as distinct from their
dissimilarity.</p>
<p>A more advanced, more critical mind, however, admits the historically
developed character of distribution relations,<sup class="enote"><a href="#n56a" id="r56a">[56a]</a></sup> but nevertheless clings all the more tenaciously to the unchanging character of production relations themselves, arising from human nature and thus independent of all historical development.</p>
<p>On the other hand, scientific analysis of the capitalist mode of production
demonstrates the contrary, that it is a mode of production of a special kind,
with specific historical features; that, like any other specific mode of
production, it presupposes a given level of the social productive forces and
their forms of development as its historical precondition: a precondition which
is itself the historical result and product of a preceding process, and from
which the new mode of production proceeds as its given basis; that the
production relations corresponding to this specific, historically determined
mode of production — relations which human beings enter into during the process
of social life, in the creation of their social life — possess a specific,
historical and transitory character; and, finally, that the distribution
relations essentially coincident with these production relations are their
opposite side, so that both share the same historically transitory character.</p>
<p>In the study of distribution relations, the initial point of departure is
the alleged fact that the annual product is apportioned among wages, profit and
rent. But if so expressed, it is a misstatement. The product is apportioned on
one side to capital, on the other to revenue. One of these revenues, wages,
never itself assumes the form of revenue, revenue of the labourer, until after
it has first confronted this labourer in the <i>form of capital.</i> The
confrontation of produced conditions of labour and of the products of labour
generally, as capital, with the direct producers implies from the outset a
definite social character of the material conditions of labour in relation to
the labourers, and thereby a definite relationship into which they enter with
the owners of the means of production and among themselves during production
itself. The transformation of these conditions of labour into capital implies in
turn the expropriation of the direct producers from the land, and thus a
definite form of landed property.</p>
<p>If one portion of the product were not transformed into capital, the other
would not assume the forms of wages, profit and rent.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the capitalist mode of production presupposes this
definite social form of the conditions of production, so does it reproduce it
continually. It produces not merely the material products, but reproduces
continually the production relations in which the former are produced, and
thereby also the corresponding distribution relations.</p>
<p>It may be said, of course, that capital itself (and landed property which it
includes as its antithesis) already presupposes a distribution: the
expropriation of the labourer from the conditions of labour, the concentration
of these conditions in the hands of a minority of individuals, the exclusive
ownership of land by other individuals, in short, all the relations which have
been described in the part dealing with primitive accumulation (Buch I, Kap.
XXIV) [English edition: Part VIII — <i>Ed</i>]. But this distribution differs
altogether from what is understood by distribution relations when the latter are
endowed with a historical character in contradistinction to production
relations. What is meant thereby are the various titles to that portion of the
product which goes into individual consumption. The aforementioned distribution
relations, on the contrary, are the basis of special social functions performed
within the production relations by certain of their agents, as opposed to the
direct producers. They imbue the conditions of production themselves and their
representatives with a specific social quality. They determine the entire
character and the entire movement of production.</p>
<p>Capitalist production is distinguished from the outset by two characteristic
features.</p>
<p><i>First.</i> It produces its products as commodities. The fact that it
produces commodities does not differentiate it from other modes of production;
but rather the fact that being a commodity is the dominant and determining
characteristic of its products. This implies, first and foremost, that the
labourer himself comes forward merely as a seller of commodities, and thus as a
free wage-labourer, so that labour appears in general as wage-labour. In view of
what has already been said, it is superfluous to demonstrate anew that the
relation between capital and wage-labour determines the entire character of the
mode of production. The principal agents of this mode of production itself, the
capitalist and the wage-labourer, are as such merely embodiments,
personifications of capital and wage-labour; definite social characteristics
stamped upon individuals by the process of social production; the products of
these definite social production relations.</p>
<p>The characteristic 1) of the product as a commodity, and 2) of the commodity
as a product of capital, already implies all circulation relations, i.e., a
definite social process through which the products must pass and in which they
assume definite social characteristics; it likewise implies definite relations
of the production agents, by which the value-expansion of their product and its
reconversion, either into means of subsistence or into means of production, are
determined. But even apart from this, the entire determination of value and the
regulation of the total production by value results from the above two
characteristics of the product as a commodity, or of the commodity as a
capitalistically produced commodity. In this entirely specific form of value,
labour prevails on the one hand solely as social labour; on the other hand, the
distribution of this social labour and the mutual supplementing and
interchanging of its products, the subordination under, and introduction into,
the social mechanism, are left to the accidental and mutually nullifying motives
of individual capitalists. Since these latter confront one another only as
commodity-owners, and everyone seeks to sell his commodity as dearly as possible
(apparently even guided in the regulation of production itself solely by his own
free will), the inner law enforces itself only through their competition, their
mutual pressure upon each other, whereby the deviations are mutually cancelled.
Only as an inner law, vis-à-vis the individual agents, as a blind law of
Nature, does the law of value exert its influence here and maintain the social
equilibrium of production amidst its accidental fluctuations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, already implicit in the commodity, and even more so in the
commodity as a product of capital, is the materialisation of the social features
of production and the personification of the material foundations of production,
which characterise the entire capitalist mode of production.</p>
<p>The <i>second</i> distinctive feature of the capitalist mode of production
is the production of surplus-value as the direct aim and determining motive of
production. Capital produces essentially capital, and does so only to the extent
that it produces surplus-value. We have seen in our discussion of relative
surplus-value, and further in considering the transformation of surplus-value
into profit, how a mode of production peculiar to the capitalist period is
founded hereon — a special form of development of the social productive powers
of labour, but confronting the labourer as powers of capital rendered
independent, and standing in direct opposition therefore to the labourer’s
own development. Production for value and surplus-value implies, as has been
shown in the course of our analysis, the constantly operating tendency to reduce
the labour-time necessary for the production of a commodity, i.e., its value,
below the actually prevailing social average. The pressure to reduce cost-price
to its minimum becomes the strongest lever for raising the social productiveness
of labour, which, however, appears here only as a continual increase in the
productiveness of capital.</p>
<p>The authority assumed by the capitalist as the personification of capital in
the direct process of production, the social function performed by him in his
capacity as manager and ruler of production, is essentially different from the
authority exercised on the basis of production by means of slaves, serfs, etc.</p>
<p>Whereas, on the basis of capitalist production, the mass of direct producers
is confronted by the social character of their production in the form of
strictly regulating authority and a social mechanism of the labour-process
organised as a complete hierarchy — this authority reaching its bearers,
however, only as the personification of the conditions of labour in contrast to
labour, and not as political or theocratic rulers as under earlier modes of
production — among the bearers of this authority, the capitalists themselves,
who confront one another only as commodity-owners, there reigns complete anarchy
within which the social interrelations of production assert themselves only as
an overwhelming natural law in relation to individual free will.</p>
<p>Only because labour pre-exists in the form of wage-labour, and the means of
production in the form of capital — i.e., solely because of this specific
social form of these essential production factors — does a part of the value
(product) appear as surplus-value and this surplus-value as profit (rent), as
the gain of the capitalist, as additional available wealth belonging to him. But
only because this surplus-value thus appears as <i>his profit</i> do the
additional means of production, which are intended for the expansion of
reproduction, and which constitute a part of this profit, present themselves as
new additional capital, and the expansion of the process of reproduction in
general as a process of capitalist accumulation.</p>
<p>Although the form of labour as wage-labour is decisive for the form of the
entire process and the specific mode of production itself, it is not wage-labour
which determines value. In the determination of value, it is a question of
social labour-time in general, the quantity of labour which society generally
has at its disposal, and whose relative absorption by the various products
determines, as it were, their respective social importance. The definite form in
which the social labour-time prevails as decisive in the determination of the
value of commodities is of course connected with the form of labour as
wage-labour and with the corresponding form of the means of production as
capital, in so far as solely on this basis does commodity-production become the
general form of production.</p>
<p>Let us moreover consider the so-called distribution relations themselves.
The wage presupposes wage-labour, and profit — capital. These definite forms of
distribution thus presuppose definite social characteristics of production
conditions, and definite social relations of production agents. The specific
distribution relations are thus merely the expression of the specific historical
production relations.</p>
<p>And now let us consider profit. This specific form of surplus-value is the
precondition for the fact that the new creation of means of production takes
place in the form of capitalist production; thus, a relation dominating
reproduction, although it seems to the individual capitalist as if he could in
reality consume his entire profit as revenue. However, he thereby meets barriers
even in the form of insurance and reserve funds laws of competition, etc., which
hamper him and prove to him in practice that profit is not a mere distribution
category of the individually consumable product. The entire process of
capitalist production is furthermore regulated by the prices of the products.
But the regulating prices of production are themselves in turn regulated by the
equalisation of the rate of profit and its corresponding distribution of capital
among the various social spheres of production. Profit, then, appears here as
the main factor, not of the distribution of products, but of their production
itself, as a factor in the distribution of capitals and labour itself among the
various spheres of production. The division of profit into profit of enterprise
and interest appears as the distribution of the same revenue. But it arises, to
begin with, from the development of capital as a self-expanding value, a creator
of surplus-value, i.e., from this specific social form of the prevailing process
of production. It evolves credit and credit institutions out of itself, and
thereby the form of production. As interest, etc., the ostensible distribution
forms enter into the price as determining production factors.</p>
<p>Ground-rent might seem to be a mere form of distribution, because landed
property as such does not perform any, or at least any normal, function in the
process of production itself. But the circumstance that 1) rent is limited to
the excess above the average profit, and that 2) the landlord is reduced from
the manager and master of the process of production and of the entire process of
social life to the position of mere lessor of land, usurer in land and mere
collector of rent, is a specific historical result of the capitalist mode of
production. The fact that the earth received the form of landed property is a
historical precondition for this. The fact that landed property assumes forms
which permit the capitalist mode of operation in agriculture is a product of the
specific character of this mode of production. The income of the landlord may be
called rent, even under other forms of society. But it differs essentially from
rent as it appears in this mode of production.</p>
<p>The so-called distribution relations, then, correspond to and arise from
historically determined specific social forms of the process of production and
mutual relations entered into by men in the reproduction process of human life.
The historical character of these distribution relations is the historical
character of production relations, of which they express merely one aspect.
Capitalist distribution differs from those forms of distribution which arise
from other modes of production, and every form of distribution disappears with
the specific form of production from which it is descended and to which it
corresponds.</p>
<p>The view which regards only distribution relations as historical, but not
production relations, is, on the one hand, solely the view of the initial, but
still handicapped, criticism of bourgeois economy. On the other hand, it rests
on the confusion and identification of the process of social production with the
simple labour-process, such as might even be performed by an abnormally isolated
human being without any social assistance. To the extent that the labour-process
is solely a process between man and Nature, its simple elements remain common to
all social forms of development. But each specific historical form of this
process further develops its material foundations and social forms. Whenever a
certain stage of maturity has been reached, the specific historical form is
discarded and makes way for a higher one. The moment of arrival of such a crisis
is disclosed by the depth and breadth attained by the contradictions and
antagonisms between the distribution relations, and thus the specific historical
form of their corresponding production relations, on the one hand, and the
productive forces, the production powers and the development of their agencies,
on the other hand. A conflict then ensues between the material development of
production and its social form.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n57" id="r57">[57]</a></sup></p>

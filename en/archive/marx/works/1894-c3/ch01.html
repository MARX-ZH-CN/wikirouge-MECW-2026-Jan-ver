<h3>Part I. The Conversion of Surplus-Value into Profit and of
the Rate of Surplus-Value into the Rate of Profit</h3>
<h1>Chapter 1. Cost-Price and profit</h1>
<p> </p>
<p class="fst">In Book I we analysed the phenomena which constitute the <i>process of
capitalist production</i> as such, as the immediate productive process, with no
regard for any of the secondary effects of outside influences. But this
immediate process of production does not exhaust the life span of capital. It is
supplemented in the actual world by the <i>process of circulation</i>, which
was the object of study in Book II. In the latter, namely in Part III, which
treated the process of circulation as a medium for the process of social
reproduction, it developed that the capitalist process of production taken as a
whole represents a synthesis of the processes of production and circulation.
Considering what this third book treats, it cannot confine itself to general
reflection relative to this synthesis. On the contrary, it must locate and
describe the concrete forms which grow out of the <i>movements of capital as a
whole</i>. In their actual movement capitals confront each other in such
concrete shape, for which the form of capital in the immediate process of
production, just as its form in the process of circulation, appear only as
special instances. The various forms of capital, as evolved in this book, thus
approach step by step the form which they assume on the surface of
society, in the action of different capitals upon one another, in competition, and
in the ordinary consciousness of the agents of production themselves. </p>
<hr class="section"/>
<p>The value of every commodity produced in the capitalist way is represented
in the formula: C = c + v + s. If we subtract surplus-values from this value of the
product there remains a bare equivalent or a substitute value in goods, for the
capital-value c + v expended in the elements of production.</p>
<p>
For example, if the production of a certain article requires a capital
outlay of £500, of which £20 are for the wear and tear of
instruments of production, £380 for the materials of production, and £100
for labour-power, and if the rate of surplus-value is 100%, then the value of
the product = 400<sub class="eq">c</sub> + 100<sub class="eq">v</sub> + 100<sub class="eq">s</sub> = £600.</p>
<p>
After deducting the surplus-value of £100, there remains a
commodity-value of £500 which only replaces the expended capital of £500. This portion of the value of the commodity, which replaces the price of the
consumed means of production and labour-power, only replaces what the commodity
costs the capitalist himself. For him it, therefore, represents the cost-price
of the commodity.</p>
<p>
What the commodity costs the capitalist and its actual production cost are
two quite different magnitudes. That portion of the commodity-value making up
the surplus-value does not cost the capitalist anything simply because it costs
the labourer unpaid labour. Yet, on the basis of capitalist production, after
the labourer enters the production process he himself constitutes an ingredient
of operating productive capital, which belongs to the capitalist. Therefore, the
capitalist is the actual producer of the commodity. For this reason the
cost-price of the commodity necessarily appears to the capitalist as the actual
cost of the commodity. If we take k to be the cost-price, the formula C = c + v + s
turns into the formula C = k + s, that is, the commodity-value = cost-price + surplus-value.</p>
<p>
The grouping of the various value portions of a commodity which only replace
the value of the capital expended in its production under the head of cost-price
expresses, on the one hand, the specific character of capitalist production. The
capitalist cost of the commodity is measured by the expenditure of <i>capital</i>,
while the actual cost of the commodity is measured by the expenditure of <i>labour</i>.
Thus, the capitalist cost-price of the commodity differs in quantity from its
value, or its actual cost-price. It is smaller than the value of the commodity,
because, with C = k + s, it is evident that k = C - s. On the other hand, the cost-price
of a commodity is by no means simply a category which exists only in capitalist
book-keeping. The individualisation of this portion of value is continually
manifest in practice in the actual production of the commodity, because it has
ever to be reconverted from its commodity-form by way of the process of
circulation into the form of productive capital, so that the cost-price of the
commodity always must repurchase the elements of production consumed in its
manufacture.</p>
<p>
The category of cost-price, on the other hand, has nothing to do with the
formation of commodity-value, or with the process of self-expansion of capital.
When I know that of the value of a commodity worth £600, five-sixths,
or £500, represent no more than an equivalent of the capital of £500
consumed in its production and that it can therefore suffice only to repurchase
the material elements of this capital, I know nothing as yet either of the way
in which these five-sixths of the value of the commodity, which represent its
cost-price, are produced, or about the way in which the last sixth, which
constitutes its surplus-value, was produced. The investigation will show,
however, that in capitalist economics the cost-price assumes the false
appearance of a category of value production itself.</p>
<p>
To return to our example. Suppose the value produced by one labourer during
an average social working-day is represented by a money sum of 6s. = 6M.
Then the advanced capital of £500 = 400<sub class="eq">c</sub> + 100<sub class="eq">v</sub> represents a value
produced in 1,666⅔ ten-hour working-days, of which 1,333⅓ working-days are crystallised in the value of the means of production = 400<sub class="eq">c</sub>, and 333⅓ are crystallised in the value of labour-power = 100<sub class="eq">v</sub>. Having assumed a rate of surplus-value of 100%, the production of the commodity to be newly formed entails a labour expenditure = 100<sub class="eq">v</sub> + 100<sub class="eq">s</sub> = 666⅔ ten-hour working-days.</p>
<p>
We know, then (see Buch 1, Kap. VII, S. 201/193) <span class="context">[English edition: Ch. IX, p. 212.-<i>Ed</i>.]</span> that the value of the newly created product of £600 is composed of 1) the reappearing value of the constant capital of £400 expended for means of production, and 2) a newly produced value of £200. The cost-price of the commodity = £500 comprises the reappearing 400<sub class="eq">c</sub> and one-half of the newly produced value of £200 ( = 100<sub class="eq">v</sub>), that is, two elements of the commodity-value which are of entirely different origin.</p>
<p>
Owing to the purposive nature of the labour expended during 666⅔ ten-hour
working-days, the value of the consumed means of production amounting to £400
is transferred from these means of production to the product. This previously
existing value thus reappears as a component part of the value of the product,
but is not created in the process of production of <i>this</i> commodity. It
exists as a component of the value of the commodity only because it previously
existed as an element of the invested capital. The expended constant capital is
therefore replaced by that portion of the value of the commodity which this
capital itself adds to that value. This element of the cost-price, therefore,
has a double meaning. On the one hand, it goes into the cost-price of the
commodity, because it is part of the commodity-value which replaces consumed
capital. And on the other hand, it forms an element of the commodity-value only
because it is the value of expended capital or because the means of production
cost so and so much.</p>
<p>
It is quite the reverse in the case of the other element of the cost-price.
The 666⅔ working-days expended in the production of the commodity
create a new value of £200. One portion of this new value merely
replaces the advanced variable capital of £100, or the price of the
labour-power employed. But this advanced capital-value does not in any way go into
the creation of the new value. So far as the advance of capital is concerned,
labour-power counts as a <i>value</i>. But in the process of production it
acts as the <i>creator</i> of value. The place of the value of the
labour-power that obtains within the advanced capital is taken in the actually
<i>functioning</i> productive capital by living value-creating labour-power itself.</p>
<p>
The difference between these various elements of the commodity-value, which
together make up the cost-price, leaps to the eye whenever a change takes place
in the size of the value of either the expended constant, or the expended
variable, part of the capital. Let the price of the same means of production, or
of the constant part of capital, rise from £400 to £600, or,
conversely, let it fall to £200. In the first case it is not only the
cost-price of the commodity which rises from £500 to 600<sub class="eq">c</sub> + 100<sub class="eq">v</sub> = £700,
but also the value of the commodity which rises from £600 to
600<sub class="eq">c</sub> + 100<sub class="eq">v</sub> + 100<sub class="eq">s</sub> = £800. 
In the second case, it is not only the cost-price
which falls from £500 to 200<sub class="eq">c</sub>+100<sub class="eq">v</sub> = £300, but also
the value of the commodity which falls from £600 to
200<sub class="eq">c</sub> + 100<sub class="eq">v</sub> + 100<sub class="eq">s</sub> = £400.
Since the expended constant capital transfers its own value to the
product, the value of the product rises or falls with the absolute magnitude of that
capital-value, other conditions remaining equal. Assume, on the other hand,
that, other circumstances remaining unchanged, the price of the same amount of
labour-power rises from £100 to £150, or, conversely, that
it falls from £100 to £50. In the first case, the cost-price
rises from £500 to 400<sub class="eq">c</sub> + 150<sub class="eq">v</sub> = £550, and falls in the second
case from £500 to 400<sub class="eq">c</sub> + 50<sub class="eq">v</sub> = £450. But in either case the
commodity-value remains unchanged = £600; one time it is
400<sub class="eq">c</sub> + 150<sub class="eq">v</sub> + 50<sub class="eq">s</sub>, and the other time, 
400<sub class="eq">c</sub> + 50<sub class="eq">v</sub> + 150<sub class="eq">s</sub>. The advanced variable
capital does not add its own value to the product. The place of its value is
taken in the product rather by a new value created by labour. Therefore, a change in the
absolute magnitude of the variable capital, so far as it expresses merely a
change in the price of labour-power, does not in the least alter the absolute
magnitude of the commodity-value, because it does not alter anything in the
absolute magnitude of the new value created by living labour-power. Such a
change rather affects only the relative proportion of the two component parts of
the new value, of which one forms surplus-value and the other makes good the
variable capital and therefore passes into the cost-price of the commodity.</p>
<p>
The two elements of the cost-price, in the present case 400<sub class="eq">c</sub> + 100<sub class="eq">v</sub>, have only this in common that they are both parts of the commodity-value that replace advanced capital.</p>
<p>
But this true state of affairs necessarily appears reversed from the standpoint of capitalist production.</p>
<p>
The capitalist mode of production differs from the mode of production based
on slavery, among other things, by the fact that in it the value, and
accordingly the price, of labour-power appears as the value, or price, of labour
itself, or as wages (Buch 1, Kap. XVII) <span class="context">[English edition: Ch. XIX. — <i>Ed</i>.]</span>.
The variable part of the advanced capital, therefore, appears as capital
expended in wages, as a capital-value which pays for the value, and accordingly
the price, of all the labour expended in production. Let us assume, for
instance, that an average ten-hour social working-day is incorporated in a sum
of money amounting to 6 shillings. In that case the advance of a variable
capital of £100 represents the money expression of a value produced in
333 ⅓; ten-hour working-days. But this value, representing purchased
labour-power in the capital advanced, does not, however, form a part of the
actually functioning productive capital. Its place in the process of production
is taken by living labour-power. If, as in our illustration, the degree of
exploitation of the latter is 100%, then it is expended during 666⅔ ten-hour
working-days, and thereby adds to the product a new value of £200. But
in the capital advanced the variable capital of £100 figures as
capital invested in wages, or as the price of labour performed during
666⅔ ten-hour days. The sum of £100 divided by 666⅔ gives
us 3 shillings as the price of a ten-hour working-day, which is equal in value to the
product of five hours' labour.</p>
<p>
Now, if we compare the capital advanced on the one hand with the
commodity-value on the other, we find:</p>
<p class="indentb">
I. Capital advanced £500 = £400 of capital expended in
means of production (price of means of production) + £100 of capital
expended in labour (price of 666⅔ working-days, or wages for same).
</p>
<p class="indentb">
II. Value of commodities £600 = £500 representing the
cost-price (£400 price of expended means of production + £100
price of expended 666⅔; working-days) + £100 surplus-value.</p>
<p>
In this formula, the portion of capital invested in labour-power differs
from that invested in means of production, such as cotton or coal, only by
serving as payment for a materially different element of production,
but not by any means because it serves a functionally different purpose in the
process of creating commodity-value, and thereby also in the process of the
self-expansion of capital. The price of the means of production reappears in the
cost-price of the commodities, just as it figured in the capital advanced, and it
does so because these means of production have been purposively consumed. The
price, or wages, for the 666⅔ working-days consumed in the
production of these commodities likewise reappears in the cost-price of the commodities
just as it has figured in the capital advanced, and also because this amount of
labour has been purposively expended. We see only finished and existing values
— the portions of the value of the advanced capital which go into the making
of the value of the product — but not the element creating new
values. The distinction between constant and variable capital has disappeared. The entire
cost-price of £500 now has the double meaning that, first, it is that
portion of the commodity-value of £600 which replaces the capital of
£500 expended in the production of the commodity; and that, secondly, this
component of the commodity-value exists only because it existed previously as the
cost-price of the elements of production employed, namely means of
production and labour, i.e., as advanced capital. The capital-value reappears as
the cost-price of a commodity because, and in so far as, it has been expended as a
capital-value.</p>
<p>
The fact that the various components of the value of the advanced capital
have been expended for materially different elements of production, namely for
instruments of labour, raw materials, auxiliary materials, and labour, requires
only that the cost-price of the commodity must buy back these materially
different elements of production. So far as the formation of the cost-price is
concerned, however, only one distinction is appreciable, namely that between
fixed and circulating capital. In our example we have set down £20 for
wear and tear of instruments of labour (400<sub class="eq">c</sub> = £20 for depreciation of
instruments of labour + £380 for materials of production). Before the
productive process the value of these instruments of labour was, say, £1,200.
After the commodities have been produced it exists in two forms, the £20
as part of the value of the commodity, and 1,200 - 20, or £1,180, as the
remaining value of the instruments of labour which, as before, are in the
possession of the capitalist; in other words, as an element of his productive,
not of his commodity-capital. Materials of production and wages, as distinct
from means of labour, are entirely consumed in the production of the commodity
and thus their entire value goes into that of the produced commodity. We have
seen how these various components of the advanced capital assume the forms of
fixed and circulating capital in relation to the turnover.</p>
<p>
Accordingly, the capital advanced = £1,680: fixed capital = £1,200 + circulating capital = £480 ( = £380 in materials of production plus £100 in wages).</p>
<p>
But the cost-price of the commodity only = £500 (£20 for
the wear and tear of the fixed capital, and £480 for circulating capital).</p>
<p>
This difference between the cost-price of the commodity and the capital
advanced merely proves, however, that the cost-price of the commodity
is formed exclusively by the capital actually consumed in its production.</p>
<p>
Means of production valued at £1,200 are employed in producing the
commodity, but only £20 of this advanced capital-value are lost in
production. Thus, the employed fixed capital goes only partially into the
cost-price of the commodity, because it is only partially consumed in its
production. The employed circulating capital goes entirely into the cost-price
of the commodity, because it is entirely consumed in production. But does not
this only prove that the consumed portions of the fixed and circulating capital
pass uniformly, <i>pro rata</i> to the magnitude of their values, into the
cost-price of the commodity and that this component of the value of the
commodity originates solely with the capital expended in its production? If this
were not so, it would be inexplicable why the advanced fixed capital of
£1,200 should not, aside from the £20 which it loses in the
productive process, also contribute the other £1,180 which it does not
lose.</p>
<p>
This difference between fixed and circulating capital with reference to the
calculation of the cost-price, therefore, only confirms the seeming origination
of the cost-price from the expended capital-value, or the price paid by the
capitalist himself for the expended elements of production, including labour. On
the other hand, so far as the formation of value is concerned, the variable
portion of capital invested in labour-power is here emphatically identified
under the head of circulating capital with constant capital (that part of
capital which consists of materials of production), and this completes the
mystification of the self-expansion process of capital.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n1" id="r1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>
So far we have considered just one element of the value of commodities, 
namely the cost-price. We must now turn also to the other component of the value
of commodities, namely the excess over the cost-price, or the surplus-value. In
the first place, then, surplus-value is the excess value of a commodity over and
above its cost-price. But since the cost-price equals the value of the consumed
capital, into whose material elements it is continually reconverted, this excess
value is an accretion in the value of the capital expended in the production of
the commodity and returning by way of its circulation.</p>
<p>
We have already seen earlier that, though s, the surplus-value, springs
merely from a change in the value of the variable capital v and is,
therefore, originally but an increment of variable capital, after the process of
production is over it nevertheless also forms an increment of c + v, the expended
total capital. The formula c + (v + s), which indicates that s is produced
through the conversion of a definite capital-value v advanced for labour-power into
a fluctuating magnitude, i.e., of a constant magnitude into a variable one, may
also be represented as (c + v) + s. Before production took place we had a capital of
£500. After production is completed we have the capital of £500
plus a value increment of £100.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n2" id="r2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>
However, surplus-value forms an increment not only of the portion of the
advanced capital which goes into the self-expansion process, but also of the
portion which does not go into it. In other words, it is an accretion not only
to the consumed capital made good out of the cost-price of the commodity, but to
all the capital invested in production. Before the production process we had a
capital valued at £1,680, namely £1,200 of fixed capital
invested in means of production, only £20 of which go into the value
of the commodity for wear and tear, plus £480 of circulating capital
in materials of production and wages. After the production process we have £1,180
as the constituent element of the value of the productive capital plus a
commodity-capital of £600. By adding these two sums of value we find
that the capitalist now has a value of £1,780. After deducting his
advanced total capital of £1,680 there remains a value increment of £100.
The £100 of surplus-value thus form as much of an increment in
relation to the invested £1,680 as to its fraction of £500
expended during production.</p>
<p>
It is now clear to the capitalist that this increment of value springs from
the productive processes undertaken with the capital, that it therefore springs
from the capital itself, because it is there after the production process, while
it is not there before it. As for the capital consumed in production, the
surplus-value seems to spring equally from all its different elements of value
consisting of means of production and labour. For all these elements contribute
equally to the formation of the cost-price. All of them add their values,
obtaining as advanced capital, to the value of the product, and are not
differentiated as constant and variable magnitudes of value. This
becomes obvious if we assume for a moment that all the expended capital
consisted either exclusively of wages, or exclusively of the value of the means of
production. In the first case, we should then have the commodity-value of 500<sub class="eq">v</sub> + 100<sub class="eq">s</sub>
instead of the commodity-value of 400<sub class="eq">c</sub> + 100<sub class="eq">v</sub> + 100<sub class="eq">s</sub>. 
The capital of £500 laid out in
wages represents the value of all the labour expended in the production of the
commodity-value of £600, and for just this reason forms the cost-price
of the entire product. But the formation of this cost-price, whereby the value
of the expended capital is reproduced as a constituent part of the value of the
product, is the only process in the formation of this commodity-value that is
known to us. We do not know how its surplus-value portion of £100 is
formed. The same is true in the second case, in which the commodity-value =
500<sub class="eq">c</sub> + 100<sub class="eq">s</sub>. We know in both cases that surplus-value is derived from a given value, because this value was advanced in the form of productive capital, be it in the form of labour or of means of production. On the other hand, this advanced capital-value cannot form surplus-value for the reason that it has been expended and therefore constitutes the cost-price of the commodity. Precisely
because it forms the cost-price of the commodity, it does not form any
surplus-value, but merely an equivalent, a value replacing the expended capital.
So far, therefore, as it forms surplus-value, it does so not in its specific
capacity as expended, but rather as advanced, and hence utilised, capital. For
this reason, the surplus-value arises as much out of the portion of the
advanced capital which goes into the cost-price of the commodity, as out of the
portion which does not. In short, it arises equally out of the fixed and the
circulating components of the utilised capital. The aggregate capital serves
materially as the creator of products, the means of labour as well as the materials
of production, and the labour. The total capital materially enters into the actual
labour-process, even though only a portion of it enters the process of
self-expansion. This is, perhaps, the very reason why it contributes only in
part to the formation of the cost-price, but totally to the formation
of surplus-value. However that may be, the outcome is that surplus-value springs
simultaneously from all portions of the invested capital. This deduction may be
substantially abbreviated, by saying pointedly and concisely in the words of
Malthus:</p>
<p class="indentb">
“The capitalist ... <i>expects</i> an equal profit upon all the parts of the capital which he advances.” <sup class="enote"><a href="#n3" id="r3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>
In its assumed capacity of offspring of the aggregate advanced capital,
surplus-value takes the converted form of <i>profit</i>. Hence, a certain
value is capital when it is invested with a view to producing profit
<sup class="enote"><a href="#n4" id="r4">[4]</a></sup>,
or, there is profit because a certain value was employed
as capital. Suppose profit is p. Then the formula C = c + v + s = k + s turns
into the formula C = k + p, or the <i>value of a commodity</i> = <i>cost-price</i> + 

<i>profit</i>.</p>
<p>
The profit, such as it is represented here, is thus the same as
surplus-value, only in a mystified form that is nonetheless a necessary
outgrowth of the capitalist mode of production. The genesis of the mutation of
values that occurs in the course of the production process, must be transferred
from the variable portion of the capital to the total capital, because there is
no apparent distinction between constant and variable capital in the assumed
formation of the cost-price. Because at one pole the price of labour-power
assumes the transmuted form of wages, surplus-value appears at the opposite pole
in the transmuted form of profit.</p>
<p>
We have seen that the cost-price of a commodity is smaller than its value.
Since C = k + s, it follows that k = C - s. The formula C = k + s reduces itself to
C = k, or commodity-value = commodity cost-price only if s = 0, a case which never
occurs on the basis of capitalist production, although peculiar market conditions may
reduce the selling price of commodities to the level of, or even below, their
cost-price.</p>
<p>
Hence, if a commodity is sold at its value, a profit is realised which is
equal to the excess of its value over its cost-price, and therefore equal to the
entire surplus-value incorporated in the value of the commodity. But the
capitalist may sell a commodity at a profit even when he sells it below its
value. So long as its selling price is higher than its cost-price, though it may
be lower than its value, a portion of the surplus-value incorporated in it is
always realised, thus always yielding a profit. In our illustration the value of
the commodity is £600, and the cost-price £500. If the
commodity is sold at £510, 520, 530, 560 or 590, it is sold
respectively £90, 80, 70, 40, or 10 below its value. Yet a
profit of £10, 20, 30, 60, or 90 respectively is realised in its sale. There is
obviously an indefinite number of selling prices possible between the value of a
commodity and its cost-price. The greater the surplus-value element of the value
of a commodity, the greater the practical range of these intermediate prices.</p>
<p>
This explains more than just the everyday phenomena of competition, such as
certain cases of underselling, abnormally low commodity-prices in certain lines
of industry <sup class="enote"><a href="#n5" id="r5">[5]</a></sup>, etc. The fundamental law of capitalist
competition, which political economy had not hitherto grasped, the law which
regulates the general rate of profit and the so-called prices of production
determined by it, rests, as we shall later see, on this difference between the
value and the cost-price of commodities, and on the resulting possibility of
selling a commodity at a profit under its value.</p>
<p>
The minimal limit of the selling price of a commodity is its cost-price. If
it is sold under its cost-price, the expended constituent elements of productive
capital cannot be fully replaced out of the selling price. If this process
continues, the value of the advanced capital disappears. From this point of view
alone, the capitalist is inclined to regard the cost-price as the true <i>inner</i>
value of the commodity, because it is the price required for the bare
conservation of his capital. But there is also this, that the cost-price of a
commodity is the purchase price paid by the capitalist himself for its
production, therefore the purchase price determined by the production process
itself. For this reason, the excess value, or the surplus-value, realised in the
sale of a commodity appears to the capitalist as an excess of its selling price
over its value, instead of an excess of its value over its cost-price, so that
accordingly the surplus-value incorporated in a commodity is not realised
through its sale, but springs out of the sale itself. We have given this
illusion closer consideration in Book I (Kap. IV, 2) <span class="context">[English edition: Ch. V, 2.
— <i>Ed</i>.]</span> (“Contradictions in the General Formula of Capital”), but revert here for a moment to the form in which it was reaffirmed by Torrens, among others, as an advance of political economy beyond Ricardo.</p>
<p class="indentb">
“The natural price, consisting of the cost of production, or, in other
words, of the capital expended in raising or fabricating commodities, cannot
include the profit.... The farmer, we will suppose, expends one hundred quarters
of corn in cultivating his fields, and obtains in return one hundred and twenty
quarters. In this case, twenty quarters, being the excess of produce above
expenditure, constitute the farmer's profit; but it would be absurd to call this
excess, or profit, a part of the expenditures... The master manufacturer expends
a certain quantity of raw material, of tools and implements of trade, and of
subsistence for labour, and obtains in return a quantity of finished work. This
finished work must possess a higher exchangeable value than the materials,
tools, and subsistence, by the advance of which it was obtained.” </p>
<p>
Torrens concludes therefrom that the excess of the selling price over the
cost-price, or profit, is derived from the fact that the consumers,</p>
<p class="indentb">
“either by immediate or circuitous barter give some greater portion of all the ingredients
of capital than their production costs.” <sup class="enote"><a href="#n6" id="r6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Indeed, the excess over a given magnitude cannot form a part of this
magnitude, and therefore the profit, the excess value of a commodity over the
capitalist's expenditures, cannot form a part of these expenditures. Hence, if
no other element than the value advance of the capitalist enters into the
formation of the value of a commodity, it is inexplicable how more value should
come out of production than went into it, for something cannot come out of
nothing. But Torrens only evades this creation out of nothing by transferring it
from the sphere of commodity-production to that of commodity-circulation. Profit
cannot come out of production, says Torrens, for otherwise it would already be
contained in the cost of production, and there would not be a surplus over this
cost. Profit cannot come out of the exchange of commodities, replies
Ramsay, unless it already existed before this exchange. The sum of the value of the
exchanged products is evidently not altered in the exchange of these products,
whose sum of value it is. It is the same before and after the exchange.
It should be noted here that Malthus refers expressly to the authority of Torrens
<sup class="enote"><a href="#n7" id="r7">[7]</a></sup>
although he himself has a different explanation for
the sale of commodities above their value, or rather has no explanation at all,
since all arguments of this sort never, in effect, fail to be reduced to the
same thing as the once-famed negative weight of phlogiston.</p>
<p>
In a social order dominated by capitalist production even the non-capitalist
producer is gripped by capitalist conceptions. Balzac, who is generally
remarkable for his profound grasp of reality, aptly describes in his last novel,
<i>Les Paysans</i>, how a petty peasant performs many small tasks
gratuitously for his usurer, whose goodwill he is eager to retain, and how he
fancies that he does not give the latter something for nothing because his own
labour does not cost him any cash outlay. As for the usurer, he thus fells two
dogs with one stone. He saves the cash outlay for wages and enmeshes the
peasant, who is gradually ruined by depriving his own field of labour, deeper
and deeper in the spider-web of usury.</p>
<p>
The thoughtless conception that the cost-price of a commodity constitutes
its actual value, and that surplus-value springs from selling the product above
its value, so that commodities would be sold at their value if their selling
price were to equal their cost-price, i.e., if it were to equal the price of the
consumed means of production plus wages, has been heralded to the world
as a newly discovered secret of socialism by Proudhon with his customary
quasi-scientific chicanery. Indeed, this reduction of the value of
commodities to their cost-price is the basis of his People's Bank. It was earlier
shown that the various constituent elements of the value of a product may be
represented in proportional parts of the product itself. For instance (Buch I, Kap. VI
1, 2, S. 211/203) <span class="context">[English edition: Ch. IX, 2, pp. 220-21. — <i>Ed</i>.]</span>
if the value of 20 lbs. of yarn is 30 shillings — namely 24 shillings of
means of production, 3 shillings of labour-power, and 3 shillings of
surplus-value — then this surplus-value may be represented as 1/10 of the product=2
lbs. of yarn. Should these 20 lbs. of yarn now be sold at their cost-price, at 27
shillings, then the purchaser receives 2 lbs. of yarn for nothing, or the
article is sold 1/10 below its value. But the labourer has, as before, performed
his surplus-labour, only this time for the purchaser of the yarn instead of the
capitalist yarn producer. It would be altogether wrong to assume that if all
commodities were sold at their cost-price, the result would really be the same
as if they had all been sold above their cost-price, but at their value. For
even if the value of the labour-power, the length of the working-day, and the
degree of exploitation of labour were the same everywhere, the quantities of
surplus-value contained in the values of the various kinds of commodities would
be unequal, depending on the different organic composition of the capitals
advanced for their production.<sup class="enote"><a href="#n8" id="r8">[8]</a></sup></p>

“From what has gone before, we know that surplus-value is purely the result of a variation in the value of v, of that portion of the capital which is transformed into labour-power; consequently, v + s = v + <span class="greek">D</span>v
(or v plus an increment of v). But the fact that it is v alone that varies, and the conditions of that variation, are obscured by the circumstance that in consequence of the increase in the variable component of the capital, there is also an increase in the sum total of the
advanced capital. It was originally £500, and becomes £590.”

“The masses of value and of surplus-value produced by different capitals — the value of
labour-power being given and its degree of exploitation being equal — vary
directly as the amounts of the variable constituents of these capitals, i.e., as their
constituents transformed into living labour-power.” (Buch 1, Kap. IX. S. 312/303.)

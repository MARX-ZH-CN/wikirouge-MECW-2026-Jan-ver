Division of Profit into Interest and Profit of Enterprise. Interest-Bearing Capital</p>
<h1>Chapter 27. The Role of Credit in Capitalist Production</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>The general remarks, which the credit system so far elicited from us, were
the following:</p>
<p>I. Its necessary development to effect the equalisation of the rate of
profit, or the movements of this equalisation, upon which the entire capitalist
production rests.</p>
<p>II. Reduction of the costs of circulation.</p>
<p>1) One of the principal costs of circulation is money itself, being value in
itself. It is economised through credit in three ways.</p>
<p>A. By dropping away entirely in a great many transactions.</p>
<p>B. By the accelerated circulation of the circulating medium.<a href="#n1" id="r1"><sup class="enote">[1]</sup></a> This corresponds in part with what is to be said under 2). On the one hand, the acceleration is technical; <i>i.e.</i>, with the same magnitude and number of actual turnovers of commodities for consumption, a smaller quantity of money or money tokens performs the same
service. This is bound up with the technique of banking. On the other hand,
credit accelerates the velocity of the metamorphoses of commodities and thereby
the velocity of money circulation.</p>
<p>C. Substitution of paper for gold money.</p>
<p>2) Acceleration, by means of credit, of the individual phases of circulation
or of the metamorphosis of commodities, later the metamorphosis of capital, and
with it an acceleration of the process of reproduction in general. (On the other
hand, credit helps to keep the acts of buying and selling longer apart and
serves thereby as a basis for speculation.) Contraction of reserve funds, which
may be viewed in two ways: as a reduction of the circulating medium, on the one
hand, and, on the other, as a reduction of that part of capital which must
always exist in the form of money.<a href="#n2" id="r2"><sup class="enote">[2]</sup></a></p>
<p>III. Formation of stock companies. Thereby:</p>
<p>1) An enormous expansion of the scale of production and of enterprises, that
was impossible for individual capitals. At the same time, enterprises that were
formerly government enterprises, become public.</p>
<p>2) The capital, which in itself rests on a social mode of production and
presupposes a social concentration of means of production and labour-power, is
here directly endowed with the form of social capital (capital of directly
associated individuals) as distinct from private capital, and its undertakings
assume the form of social undertakings as distinct from private undertakings. It
is the abolition of capital as private property within the framework of
capitalist production itself.</p>
<p>3) Transformation of the actually functioning capitalist into a mere
manager, administrator of other people's capital, and of the owner of capital
into a mere owner, a mere money-capitalist. Even if the dividends which they
receive include the interest and the profit of enterprise, <i>i.e.</i>, the
total profit (for the salary of the manager is, or should be, simply the wage of
a specific type of skilled labour, whose price is regulated in the labour-market
like that of any other labour), this total profit is henceforth received only in
the form of interest, <i>i.e.</i>, as mere compensation for owning capital that
now is entirely divorced from the function in the actual process of
reproduction, just as this function in the person of the manager is divorced
from ownership of capital. Profit thus appears (no longer only that portion of
it, the interest, which derives its justification from the profit of the
borrower) as a mere appropriation of the surplus-labour of others, arising from
the conversion of means of production into capital, <i>i.e.</i>, from their
alienation vis-à-vis the actual producer, from their antithesis as
another's property to every individual actually at work in production, from
manager down to the last day-labourer. In stock companies the function is
divorced from capital ownership, hence also labour is entirely divorced from
ownership of means of production and surplus-labour. This result of the ultimate
development of capitalist production is a necessary transitional phase towards
the reconversion of capital into the property of producers, although no longer
as the private property of the individual producers, but rather as the property
of associated producers, as outright social property. On the other hand, the
stock company is a transition toward the conversion of all functions in the
reproduction process which still remain linked with capitalist property, into
mere functions of associated producers, into social functions.</p>
<p>Before we go any further, there is still the following economically
important fact to be noted: Since profit here assumes the pure form of interest,
undertakings of this sort are still possible if they yield bare interest, and
this is one of the causes, stemming the fall of the general rate of profit,
since such undertakings, in which the ratio of constant capital to the variable
is so enormous, do not necessarily enter into the equalisation of the general
rate of profit.</p>
<p>[Since Marx wrote the above, new forms of industrial enterprises have
developed, as we know, representing the second and third degree of stock
companies. The daily growing speed with which production may be enlarged in all
fields of large-scale industry today, is offset by the ever-greater slowness
with which the market for these increased products expands. What the former
turns out in months, can scarcely be absorbed by the latter in years. Add to
this the protective tariff policy, by which every industrial country shuts
itself off from all others, particularly from England, and also artificially
increases domestic production capacity. The results are a general chronic
over-production, depressed prices, falling and even wholly disappearing profits;
in short, the old boasted freedom of competition has reached the end of its
tether and must itself announce its obvious, scandalous bankruptcy. And in every
country this is taking place through the big industrialists of a certain branch
joining in a cartel for the regulation of production. A committee fixes the
quantity to be produced by each establishment and is the final authority for
distributing the incoming orders. Occasionally even international cartels were
established, as between the English and German iron industries. But even this
form of association in production did not suffice. The antagonism of interests
between the individual firms broke through it only too often, restoring
competition. This led in some branches, where the scale of production permitted,
to the concentration of the entire production of that branch of industry in one
big joint-stock company under single management. This has been repeatedly
effected in America; in Europe the biggest example so far is the United Alkali
Trust, which has brought all British alkali production into the hands of a
single business firm. The former owners of the more than thirty individual
plants have received shares for the appraised value of their entire
establishments, totalling about £5 million, which represent the fixed
capital of the trust. The technical management remains in the same hands as
before, but business control is concentrated in the hands of the general
management. The floating capital, totalling about £1 million, was offered
to the public for subscription. The total capital is, therefore, £6
million. Thus, in this branch, which forms the basis of the whole chemical
industry, competition has been replaced by monopoly in England, and the road has
been paved, most gratifyingly, for future expropriation by the whole of society,
the nation. — <i>F.E.</i>]</p>
<p>This is the abolition of the capitalist mode of production within the
capitalist mode of production itself, and hence a self-dissolving contradiction,
which <i>prima facie</i> represents a mere phase of transition to a new form of
production. It manifests itself as such a contradiction in its effects. It
establishes a monopoly in certain spheres and thereby requires state
interference. It reproduces a new financial aristocracy, a new variety of
parasites in the shape of promoters, speculators and simply nominal directors; a
whole system of swindling and cheating by means of corporation promotion, stock
issuance, and stock speculation. It is private production without the control of
private property.</p>
<p>IV. Aside from the stock-company business, which represents the abolition of
capitalist private industry on the basis of the capitalist system itself and
destroys private industry as it expands and invades new spheres of production,
credit offers to the individual capitalist; or to one who is regarded a
capitalist, absolute control within certain limits over the capital and property
of others, and thereby over the labour of others.<a href="#n3" id="r3"><sup class="enote">[3]</sup></a>

The control over social capital, not the individual capital of his own, gives
him control of social labour. The capital itself, which a man really owns or is
supposed to own in the opinion of the public, becomes purely a basis for the
superstructure of credit. This is particularly true of wholesale commerce,
through which the greatest portion of the social product passes. All standards
of measurement, all excuses more or less still justified under capitalist
production, disappear here. What the speculating wholesale merchant risks is
social property, not <i>his own.</i> Equally sordid becomes the phrase relating
the origin of capital to savings, for what he demands is that <i>others</i> should
save for him. [Just as all France recently saved up one and a half billion francs
for the Panama Canal swindlers. In fact, a description of the entire Panama
swindle is here correctly anticipated, fully twenty years before it occurred. — <i>F.E.</i>]
The other phrase concerning abstention is squarely refuted by his luxury, which
is now itself a means of credit. Conceptions which have some meaning on a less
developed stage of capitalist production, become quite meaningless here. Success
and failure both lead here to a centralisation of capital, and thus to
expropriation on the most enormous scale. Expropriation extends here from the
direct producers to the smaller and the medium-sized capitalists themselves. It
is the point of departure for the capitalist mode of production; its
accomplishment is the goal of this production. In the last instance, it aims at
the expropriation of the means of production from all individuals. With the
development of social production the means of production cease to be means of
private production and products of private production, and can thereafter be
only means of production in the hands of associated producers, <i>i.e.</i>, the
latter's social property, much as they are their social products. However, this
expropriation appears within the capitalist system in a contradictory form, as
appropriation of social property by a few; and credit lends the latter more and
more the aspect of pure adventurers. Since property here exists in the form of
stock, its movement and transfer become purely a result of gambling on the stock
exchange, where the little fish are swallowed by the sharks and the lambs by the
stock-exchange wolves. There is antagonism against the old form in the stock
companies, in which social means of production appear as private property; but
the conversion to the form of stock still remains ensnared in the trammels of
capitalism; hence, instead of overcoming the antithesis between the character of
wealth as social and as private wealth, the stock companies merely develop it in
a new form.</p>
<p>The co-operative factories of the labourers themselves represent within the
old form the first sprouts of the new, although they naturally reproduce, and
must reproduce, everywhere in their actual organisation all the shortcomings of
the prevailing system. But the antithesis between capital and labour is overcome
within them, if at first only by way of making the associated labourers into
their own capitalist, <i>i.e.</i>, by enabling them to use the means of
production for the employment of their own labour. They show how a new mode of
production naturally grows out of an old one, when the development of the
material forces of production and of the corresponding forms of social
production have reached a particular stage. Without the factory system arising
out of the capitalist mode of production there could have been no co-operative
factories. Nor could these have developed without the credit system arising out
of the same mode of production. The credit system is not only the principal
basis for the gradual transformation of capitalist private enterprises into
capitalist stock companies, but equally offers the means for the gradual
extension of co-operative enterprises on a more or less national scale. The
capitalist stock companies, as much as the co-operative factories, should be
considered as transitional forms from the capitalist mode of production to the
associated one, with the only distinction that the antagonism is resolved
negatively in the one and positively in the other.</p>
<p>So far we have considered the development of the credit system — and the
implicit latent abolition of capitalist property — mainly with reference to
industrial capital. In the following chapters we shall consider credit with
reference to interest-bearing capital as such, and to its effect on this
capital, and the form it thereby assumes; and there are generally a few more
specifically economic remarks still to be made.</p>
<p>But first this:</p>
<p>The credit system appears as the main lever of over-production and
over-speculation in commerce solely because the reproduction process, which is
elastic by nature, is here forced to its extreme limits, and is so forced
because a large part of the social capital is employed by people who do not own
it and who consequently tackle things quite differently than the owner, who
anxiously weighs the limitations of his private capital in so far as he handles
it himself. This simply demonstrates the fact that the self-expansion of capital
based on the contradictory nature of capitalist production permits an actual
free development only up to a certain point, so that in fact it constitutes an
immanent fetter and barrier to production, which are continually broken through
by the credit system.<a href="#n4" id="r4"><sup class="enote">[4]</sup></a> Hence, the credit system accelerates the material development of the productive forces and the establishment of the world-market. It is the historical mission of the
capitalist system of production to raise these material foundations of the new
mode of production to a certain degree of perfection. At the same time credit
accelerates the violent eruptions of this contradiction — crises — and
thereby the elements of disintegration of the old mode of production.</p>
<p>The two characteristics immanent in the credit system are, on the one hand,
to develop the incentive of capitalist production, enrichment through
exploitation of the labour of others, to the purest and most colossal form of
gambling and swindling, and to reduce more and more the number of the few who
exploit the social wealth; on the other hand, to constitute the form of
transition to a new mode of production. It is this ambiguous nature, which
endows the principal spokesmen of credit from Law to Isaac Péreire with the
pleasant character mixture of swindler and prophet.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="information">
<a href="#r1" id="n1"><span class="term">1.</span></a> "The average of notes in circulation during the year was, in 1812, 106,538,000 francs; in 1818,
101,205,000 francs; whereas the movement of the currency, or the annual
aggregate of disbursements and upon all accounts, was, in 1812, 2,837,712,000
francs; in 1818, 9,665,030,000 francs. The activity of the currency in France,
therefore, during the year 1818, as compared with its activity in 1812, was in
the proportion of three to one. The great regulator of the velocity of
circulation is credit.... This explains, why a severe pressure upon the
money-market is generally coincident with a full circulation." (<i>The
Currency Theory Reviewed, etc.,</i> p. 65) — "Between September 1833 and September 1843 nearly 300 banks were added to the various issuers of notes
throughout the United Kingdom; the result was a reduction in the circulation to
the extent of two million and a half; it was £36,035,244 at the close of
September 1833, and £33,518,554 at the close of September 1843." (L.
c., p. 53) — "The prodigious activity of Scottish circulation enables
it, with £100, to effect the same quantity of monetary transactions, which
in England it requires £420 to accomplish." (L. c., p. 55. This last
refers only to the technical side of the operation.)</p>
<p class="information">
<a href="#r2" id="n2"><span class="term">2.</span></a> Before the establishment of the banks ... the amount of capital withdrawn for the purposes of currency was greater, at all times, than the actual circulation of commodities required." (<i>Economist,</i> 1845, p. 238.)</p>
<p class="information">
<a href="#r3" id="n3"><span class="term">3.</span></a> See, for instance, in the <i>Times</i> the list of business bankruptcies in a crisis year such as 1857 and compare the private property of those bankrupt with the amount of their debts. "The
truth is that the power of purchase by persons having capital and credit is much
beyond anything that those who are unacquainted practically with speculative
markets have any idea of." (Tooke, <i>Inquiry into the Currency Principle,</i> p. 79.) "A person having the reputation of capital enough for his
regular business, and enjoying good credit in his trade, if he takes a sanguine
view of the prospect of a rise of price of the article in which he deals, and is
favoured by circumstances in the outset and progress of his speculation, may
effect purchases to an extent perfectly enormous compared with his capital"
(<i>Ibid.,</i> p. 136). "Merchants, manufacturers, etc., carry on
operations much beyond those which the use of their own capital alone would
enable them to do.... Capital is rather the foundation upon which a good credit
is built than the limit of the transactions of any commercial establishment."
(<i>Economist,</i> 1847, p. 333.)</p>

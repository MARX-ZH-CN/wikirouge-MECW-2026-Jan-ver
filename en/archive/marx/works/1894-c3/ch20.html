Conversion of Commodity-Capital and Money-Capital into Commercial Capital and Money-Dealing Capital (Merchant's Capital)</p>
<h1>Chapter 20. Historical Facts about Merchant's Capital</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>The particular form in which commercial and money-dealing capitals
accumulate money will be discussed in the next part.</p>
<p>It is self-evident from what has gone before that nothing could be more
absurd than to regard merchant's capital, whether in the shape of commercial or
of money-dealing capital, as a particular variety of industrial capital, such
as, say, mining, agriculture, cattle-raising, manufacturing, transport, etc.,
which are side lines of industrial capital occasioned by the division of social
labour, and hence different spheres of investment. The simple observation that
in the circulation phase of its reproduction process every industrial capital
performs as commodity-capital and as money-capital the very functions which
appear as the exclusive functions of the two forms of merchant's capital, should
rule out such a crude notion. On the other hand, in commercial and money-dealing
capital the differences between industrial capital as productive capital and the
same capital in the sphere of circulation are individualised through the fact
that the definite forms and functions which capital assumes for the moment
appear as independent forms and functions of a separate portion of the capital
and are exclusively bound up with it. The transmuted form of industrial capital
and the material differences between productive capitals applied in different
branches of industry, which arise from the nature of these various branches, are
worlds apart.</p>
<p>Aside from the crudity with which the economist generally considers
distinctions of form, which really concern him only from their substantive side,
this misconception by the vulgar economist is explained on two additional
counts. First, his inability to explain the peculiar nature of mercantile
profit; and, secondly, his apologetic endeavours to deduce commodity-capital and
money-capital, and later commercial capital and money-dealing capital as forms
arising necessarily from the process of production as such, whereas they are due
to the specific form of the capitalist mode of production, which above all
presupposes the circulation of commodities, and hence of money, as its basis.</p>
<p>If commercial capital and money-dealing capital do not differ from grain
production any more than this differs from cattle-raising and manufacturing, it
is plain as day that production and capitalist production are altogether
identical, and that, among other things, the distribution of the social products
among the members of a society, be it for productive or individual consumption,
must just as consistently be handled by merchants and bankers as the consumption
of meat by cattle-raising and that of clothing by their manufacture.
<a href="#1" id="1a"><sup class="enote">[1]</sup></a></p>
<p>The great economists, such as Smith, Ricardo, etc., are perplexed over
mercantile capital being a special variety, since they consider the basic form
of capital, capital as industrial capital, and circulation capital
(commodity-capital and money-capital) solely because it is a phase in the
reproduction process of every capital. The rules concerning the formation of
value, profit, etc., immediately deduced by them from their study of industrial
capital, do not extend directly to merchant's capital. For this reason, they
leave merchant's capital entirely aside and mention it only as a kind of
industrial capital. Wherever they make a special analysis of it, as Ricardo does
in dealing with foreign trade, they seek to demonstrate that it creates no value
(and consequently no surplus-value). But whatever is true of foreign trade, is
also true of home trade.</p>
<hr width="30%"/>
<p>Hitherto we have considered merchant's capital merely from the standpoint,
and within the limits, of the capitalist mode of production. However, not
commerce alone, but also merchant's capital, is older than the capitalist mode
of production, is, in fact, historically the oldest free state of existence of
capital.</p>
<p>Since we have already seen that money-dealing and the capital advanced for
it require nothing more for their development than the existence of wholesale
commerce, and further of commercial capital, it is only the latter which we must
occupy ourselves with here.</p>
<p>Since merchant's capital is penned in the sphere of circulation, and since
its function consists exclusively of promoting the exchange of commodities, it
requires no other conditions for its existence — aside from the undeveloped
forms arising from direct barter — outside those necessary for the simple
circulation of commodities and money. Or rather, the latter is the condition of
<i>its</i> existence. No matter what the basis on which products are produced,
which are thrown into circulation as commodities — whether the basis of the
primitive community, of slave production, of small peasant and petty bourgeois,
or the capitalist basis, the character of products as commodities is not
altered, and as commodities they must pass through the process of exchange and
its attendant changes of form. The extremes between which merchant's capital
acts as mediator exist for it as given, just as they are given for money and for
its movements. The only necessary thing is that these extremes should be on hand
as commodities, regardless of whether production is wholly a production of
commodities, or whether only the surplus of the independent producers' immediate
needs, satisfied by their own production, is thrown on the market. Merchant's
capital promotes only the movements of these extremes, of these commodities,
which are preconditions of its own existence.</p>
<p>The extent to which products enter trade and go through the merchants' hands
depends on the mode of production, and reaches its maximum in the ultimate
development of capitalist production, where the product is produced solely as a
commodity, and not as a direct means of subsistence. On the other hand, on the
basis of every mode of production, trade facilitates the production of
surplus-products destined for exchange, in order to increase the enjoyments, or
the wealth, of the producers (here meant are the owners of the products). Hence,
commerce imparts to production a character directed more and more towards
exchange-value.</p>
<p>The metamorphosis of commodities, their movement, consists 1) materially, of
the exchange of different commodities for one another, and 2) formally, of the
conversion of commodities into money by sale, and of money into commodities by
purchase. And the function of merchant's capital resolves itself into these very
acts of buying and selling commodities. It therefore merely promotes the
exchange of commodities; yet this exchange is not to be conceived at the outset
as a bare exchange of commodities between direct producers. Under slavery,
feudalism and vassalage (so far as primitive communities are concerned) it is
the slave-owner, the feudal lord, the tribute-collecting state, who are the
owners, hence sellers, of the products. The merchant buys and sells for many.
Purchases and sales are concentrated in his hands and consequently are no longer
bound to the direct requirements of the buyer (as merchant).</p>
<p>But whatever the social organisation of the spheres of production whose
commodity exchange the merchant promotes, his wealth exists always in the form
of money, and his money always serves as capital. Its form is always M — C — M'.
Money, the independent form of exchange-value, is the point of departure, and
increasing the exchange-value an end in itself. Commodity exchange as such and
the operations effecting it — separated from production and performed by
non-producers — are just a means of increasing wealth not as mere wealth, but as
wealth in its most universal social form, as exchange-value. The compelling
motive and determining purpose are the conversion of M into M + ΔM. The transactions M — C and C — M', which promote
M — M', appear merely as stages of transition in this conversion of M into M + ΔM. This M — C — M', the characteristic movement of
merchant's capital, distinguishes it from C — M — C, trade in commodities
directly between producers, which has for its ultimate end the exchange of
use-values.</p>
<p>The less developed the production, the more wealth in money is concentrated
in the hands of merchants or appears in the specific form of merchants' wealth.</p>
<p>Within the capitalist mode of production — <i>i.e.</i>, as soon as
capital has established its sway over production and imparted to it a wholly
changed and specific form — merchant's capital appears merely as a capital
with a <i>specific</i> function. In all previous modes of production, and all
the more, wherever production ministers to the immediate wants of the producer,
merchant's capital appears to perform the function <i>par excellence</i> of
capital.</p>
<p>There is, therefore, not the least difficulty in understanding why
merchant's capital appears as the historical form of capital long before capital
established its own domination over production. Its existence and development to
a certain level are in themselves historical premises for the development of
capitalist production 1) as premises for the concentration of money wealth, and
2) because the capitalist mode of production presupposes production for trade,
selling on a large scale, and not to the individual customer, hence also a
merchant who does not buy to satisfy his personal wants but concentrates the
purchases of many buyers in his one purchase. On the other hand, all development
of merchant's capital tends to give production more and more the character of
production for exchange-value and to turn products more and more into
commodities. Yet its development, as we shall presently see, is incapable by
itself of promoting and explaining the transition from one mode of production to
another.</p>
<p>Within capitalist production merchant's capital is reduced from its former
independent existence to a special phase in the investment of capital, and the
levelling of profits reduces its rate of profit to the general average. It
functions only as an agent of productive capital. The special social conditions
that take shape with the development of merchant's capital, are here no longer
paramount. On the contrary, wherever merchant's capital still predominates we
find backward conditions. This is true even within one and the same country, in
which, for instance, the specifically merchant towns present far more striking
analogies with past conditions than industrial towns.<a href="#2" id="2a"><sup class="enote">[2]</sup></a></p>
<p>The independent and predominant development of capital as merchant's capital
is tantamount to the non-subjection of production to capital, and hence to
capital developing on the basis of an alien social mode of production which is
also independent of it. The independent development of merchant's capital,
therefore, stands in inverse proportion to the general economic development of
society. </p>
<p>Independent mercantile wealth as a predominant form of capital represents
the separation of the circulation process from its extremes, and these extremes
are the exchanging producers themselves. They remain independent of the
circulation process, just as the latter remains independent of them. The product
becomes a commodity by way of commerce. It is commerce which here turns products
into commodities, not the produced commodity which by its movements gives rise
to commerce. Thus, capital appears here first as capital in the process of
circulation. It is in the circulation process that money develops into capital.
It is in circulation that products first develop as exchange-values, as
commodities and as money. Capital can, and must, form in the process of
circulation, before it learns to control its extremes — the various spheres
of production between which circulation mediates. Money and commodity
circulation can mediate between spheres of production of widely different
organisation, whose internal structure is still chiefly adjusted to the output
of use-values. This individualisation of the circulation process, in which
spheres of production are interconnected by means of a third, has a two-fold
significance. On the one hand, that circulation has not as yet established a
hold on production, but is related to it as to a given premise. On the other
hand, that the production process has not as yet absorbed circulation as a mere
phase of production. Both, however, are the case in capitalist production. The
production process rests wholly upon circulation, and circulation is a mere
transitional phase of production, in which the product created as a commodity is
realised and its elements of production, likewise created as commodities, are
replaced. That form of capital — merchant's capital — which developed
directly out of circulation appears here merely as one of the forms of capital
occurring in its reproduction process.</p>
<p>The law that the independent development of merchant's capital is inversely
proportional to the degree of development of capitalist production is
particularly evident in the history of the carrying trade, as among the
Venetians, Genoese, Dutch, etc., where the principal gains were not thus made by
exporting domestic products, but by promoting the exchange of products of
commercially and otherwise economically undeveloped societies, and by exploiting
both producing countries.<a href="#3" id="3a"><sup class="enote">[3]</sup></a> Here, merchant's
capital is in its pure form, separated from the extremes — the spheres of
production between which it mediates. This is the main source of its
development. But this monopoly of the carrying trade disintegrates, and with it
this trade itself, proportionately to the economic development of the peoples,
whom it exploits at both ends of its course, and whose lack of development was
the basis of its existence. In the case of the carrying trade this appears not
only as the decline of a special branch of commerce, but also that of the
predominance of the purely trading nations, and of their commercial wealth in
general, which rested upon the carrying trade. This is but a special form, in
which is expressed the subordination of merchants to industrial capital with
the advance of capitalist production. The behaviour of merchant's capital
wherever it rules over production is strikingly illustrated not only by the
colonial economy (the so-called colonial system) in general, but quite
specifically by the methods of the old Dutch East India Company.</p>
<p>Since the movement of merchant's capital is M — C — M', the merchant's
profit is made, first, in acts which occur only within the circulation process,
hence in the two acts of buying and selling; and, secondly, it is realised in
the last act, the sale. It is therefore profit upon alienation. <i>Prima facie,</i> a pure and independent commercial profit seems impossible so long as
products are sold at their value. To buy cheap in order to sell dear is the rule
of trade. Hence, not the exchange of equivalents. The conception of value is
included in it in so far as the various commodities are all values, and
therefore money. In respect to quality they are all expressions of social
labour. But they are not values of equal magnitude. The quantitative ratio in
which products are exchanged is at first quite arbitrary. They assume the form
of commodities inasmuch as they are exchangeables, <i>i.e.</i>, expressions of
one and the same third. Continued exchange and more regular reproduction for
exchange reduces this arbitrariness more and more. But at first not for the
producer and consumer, but for their go-between, the merchant, who compares
money-prices and pockets the difference. It is through his own movements that he
establishes equivalence.</p>
<p>Merchant's capital is originally merely the intervening movement between
extremes which it does not control, and between premises which it does not
create.</p>
<p>Just as money originates from the bare form of commodity-circulation, C — M — C,
not only as a measure of value and a medium of circulation, but also as the
absolute form of commodity, and hence of wealth, or hoard, so that its
conservation and accumulation as money becomes an end in itself, so, too, does
money, the hoard, as something that preserves and increases itself through mere
alienation, originate from the bare form of the circulation of merchant's
capital, M — C — M'.</p>
<p>The trading nations of ancient times existed like the gods of Epicurus in
the intermediate worlds of the universe, or rather like the Jews in the pores of
Polish society. The trade of the first independent flourishing merchant towns
and trading nations rested as a pure carrying trade upon the barbarism of the
producing nations, between whom they acted the middleman.</p>
<p>In the pre-capitalist stages of society commerce ruled industry. In modern
society the reverse is true. Of course, commerce will have more or less of a
counter-effect on the communities between which it is carried on. It will
subordinate production more and more to exchange-value by making luxuries and
subsistence more dependent on sale than on the immediate use of the products.
Thereby it dissolves the old relationships. It multiplies money circulation. It
encompasses no longer merely the surplus of production, but bites deeper and
deeper into the latter, and makes entire branches of production dependent upon
it. Nevertheless this disintegrating effect depends very much on the nature of
the producing community.</p>
<p>So long as merchant's capital promotes the exchange of products between
undeveloped societies, commercial profit not only appears as out-bargaining and
cheating, but also largely originates from them. Aside from the fact that it
exploits the difference between the prices of production of various countries
(and in this respect it tends to level and fix the values of commodities), those
modes of production bring it about that merchant's capital appropriates an
overwhelming portion of the surplus-product partly as a mediator between
communities which still substantially produce for use-value, and for whose
economic organisation the sale of the portion of their product entering
circulation, or for that matter any sale of products at their value, is of
secondary importance; and partly, because under those earlier modes of
production the principal owners of the surplus-product with whom the merchant
dealt, namely, the slave-owner, the feudal lord, and the state (for instance, the
oriental despot) represent the consuming wealth and luxury which the merchant
seeks to trap, as Adam Smith correctly scented in the passage on feudal times
quoted earlier. Merchant's capital, when it holds a position of dominance,
stands everywhere for a system of robbery,<a href="#4" id="4a"><sup class="enote">[4]</sup></a> so
that its development among the trading nations of old and modern times is always
directly connected with plundering, piracy, kidnapping slaves, and colonial
conquest; as in Carthage, Rome, and later among the Venetians, Portuguese,
Dutch, etc.</p>
<p>The development of commerce and merchant's capital gives rise everywhere to
the tendency towards production of exchange-values, increases its volume,
multiplies it, makes it cosmopolitan, and develops money into world-money.
Commerce, therefore, has a more or less dissolving influence everywhere on the
producing organisation, which it finds at hand and whose different forms are
mainly carried on with a view to use-value. To what extent it brings about a
dissolution of the old mode of production depends on its solidity and internal
structure. And whither this process of dissolution will lead, in other words,
what new mode of production will replace the old, does not depend on commerce,
but on the character of the old mode of production itself. In the ancient world
the effect of commerce and the development of merchant's capital always resulted
in a slave economy; depending on the point of departure, only in the
transformation of patriarchal slave system devoted to the production of
immediate means of subsistence into one devoted to the production of
surplus-value. However, in the modern world, it results in the capitalist mode
of production. It follows therefrom that these results spring in themselves from
circumstances other than the development of merchant's capital.</p>
<p>It is in the nature of things that as soon as town industry as such
separates from agricultural industry, its products are from the outset
commodities and thus require the mediation of commerce for their sale. The
leaning of commerce towards the development of towns, and, on the other hand,
the dependence of towns upon commerce, are so far natural. However, it depends
on altogether different circumstances to what measure industrial development
will go hand in hand with this development. Ancient Rome, in its later
republican days, developed merchant's capital to a higher degree than ever
before in the ancient world, without showing any progress in the development of
crafts, while in Corinth and other Grecian towns in Europe and Asia Minor the
development of commerce was accompanied by highly developed crafts. On the other
hand, quite contrary to the growth of towns and attendant conditions, the
trading spirit and the development of merchant's capital occur frequently among
unsettled nomadic peoples.</p>
<p>There is no doubt — and it is precisely this fact which has led to wholly
erroneous conceptions — that in the 16th and 17th centuries the great
revolutions, which took place in commerce with the geographical discoveries and
speeded the development of merchant's capital, constitute one of the principal
elements in furthering the transition from feudal to capitalist mode of
production. The sudden expansion of the world-market, the multiplication of
circulating commodities, the competitive zeal of the European nations to possess
themselves of the products of Asia and the treasures of America, and the
colonial system —  all contributed materially toward destroying the feudal
fetters on production. However, in its first period — the manufacturing
period — the modern mode of production developed only where the conditions
for it had taken shape within the Middle Ages. Compare, for instance, Holland
with Portugal.<a href="#5" id="5a"><sup class="enote">[5]</sup></a> And when in the 16th, and
partially still in the 17th, century the sudden expansion of commerce and
emergence of a new world-market overwhelmingly contributed to the fall of the
old mode of production and the rise of capitalist production, this was
accomplished conversely on the basis of the already existing capitalist mode of
production. The world-market itself forms the basis for this mode of production.
On the other hand, the immanent necessity of this mode of production to produce
on an ever-enlarged scale tends to extend the world-market continually, so that
it is not commerce in this case which revolutionises industry, but industry
which constantly revolutionises commerce. Commercial supremacy itself is now
linked with the prevalence to a greater or lesser degree of conditions for a
large industry. Compare, for instance, England and Holland. The history of the
decline of Holland as the ruling trading nation is the history of the
subordination of merchant's capital to industrial capital. The obstacles
presented by the internal solidity and organisation of pre-capitalistic,
national modes of production to the corrosive influence of commerce are
strikingly illustrated in the intercourse of the English with India and China.
The broad basis of the mode of production here is formed by the unity of
small-scale agriculture and home industry, to which in India we should add the
form of village communities built upon the common ownership of land, which,
incidentally, was the original form in China as well. In India the English lost
no time in exercising their direct political and economic power, as rulers and
landlords, to disrupt these small economic communities.<a href="#6" id="6a"><sup class="enote">[6]</sup></a>

English commerce exerted a revolutionary influence on these communities and tore
them apart only in so far as the low prices of its goods served to destroy the
spinning and weaving industries, which were an ancient integrating element of
this unity of industrial and agricultural production. And even so this work of
dissolution proceeds very gradually. And still more slowly in China, where it is
not reinforced by direct political power. The substantial economy and saving in
time afforded by the association of agriculture with manufacture put up a
stubborn resistance to the products of the big industries, whose prices include
the <i>faux frais</i> of the circulation process which pervades them. Unlike
the English, Russian commerce, on the other hand, leaves the economic groundwork
of Asiatic production untouched.<a href="#7" id="7a"><sup class="enote">[7]</sup></a></p>
<p>The transition from the feudal mode of production is two-fold. The producer
becomes merchant and capitalist, in contrast to the natural agricultural economy
and the guild-bound handicrafts of the medieval urban industries. This is the
really revolutionising path. Or else, the merchant establishes direct sway over
production. However much this serves historically as a stepping-stone — witness
the English 17th-century clothier, who brings the weavers, independent as they
are, under his control by selling their wool to them and buying their cloth — it
cannot by itself contribute to the overthrow of the old mode of production, but
tends rather to preserve and retain it as its precondition. The manufacturer in
the French silk industry and in the English hosiery and lace industries, for
example, was thus mostly but nominally a manufacturer until the middle of the
19th century. In point of fact, he was merely a merchant, who let the weavers
carry on in their old unorganised way and exerted only a merchant's control, for
that was for whom they really worked.<a href="#8" id="8a"><sup class="enote">[8]</sup></a> This
system presents everywhere an obstacle to the real capitalist mode of production
and goes under with its development. Without revolutionising the mode of
production, it only worsens the condition of the direct producers, turns them
into mere wage-workers and proletarians under conditions worse than those under
the immediate control of capital, and appropriates their surplus-labour on the
basis of the old mode of production. The same conditions exist in somewhat
modified form in part of the London handicraft furniture industry. It is
practised notably in the Tower Hamlets on a very large scale. The whole
production is divided into very numerous separate branches of business
independent of one another. One establishment makes only chairs, another only
tables, a third only bureaus, etc. But these establishments themselves are run
more or less like handicrafts by a single minor master and a few journeymen.
Nevertheless, production is too large to work directly for private persons. The
buyers are the owners of furniture stores. On Saturdays the master visits them
and sells his product, the transaction being closed with as much haggling as in
a pawnshop over a loan. The masters depend on this weekly sale, if for no other
reason than to be able to buy raw materials for the following week and to pay
out wages. Under these circumstances, they are really only middlemen between the
merchant and their own labourers. The merchant is the actual capitalist who
pockets the lion's share of the surplus-value.<a href="#9" id="9a"><sup class="enote">[9]</sup></a>
Almost the same applies in the transition to manufacture of branches formerly
carried on as handicrafts or side lines to rural industries. The transition to
large-scale industry depends on the technical development of these small
owner-operated establishments —  wherever they employ machinery that admits
of a handicraft-like operation. The machine is driven by steam, instead of by
hand. This is of late the case, for instance, in the English hosiery industry.</p>
<p>There is, consequently, a three-fold transition. <i>First,</i> the merchant
becomes directly an industrial capitalist. This is true in crafts based on
trade, especially crafts producing luxuries and imported by merchants together
with the raw materials and labourers from foreign lands, as in Italy from
Constantinople in the 15th century. <i>Second,</i> the merchant turns the small
masters into his middlemen, or buys directly from the independent producer,
leaving him nominally independent and his mode of production unchanged. <i>Third,</i> the industrialist becomes merchant and produces directly for the wholesale market.</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, the merchant was merely one who, as Poppe rightly says, "transferred"
the goods produced by guilds or peasants [Poppe, <i>Geschichte der Technologie
seit der Wiederherstellung der Wissenschaften bis an das Ende des achtzehnten
Jahrhunderts</i>, Band I, Göttingen. 1807, S. 70. — <i>Ed</i>.] The
merchant becomes industrialist, or rather, makes craftsmen, particularly the
small rural producers, work for him. Conversely, the producer becomes merchant.
The master weaver, for instance, buys his wool or yarn himself and sells his
cloth to the merchant, instead of receiving his wool from the merchant piecemeal
and working for him together with his journeymen. The elements of production
pass into the production process as commodities bought by himself. And instead
of producing for some individual merchant, or for specified customers, he
produces for the world of trade. The producer is himself a merchant. Merchant's
capital does no more than carry on the process of circulation. Originally,
commerce was the precondition for the transformation of the crafts, the rural
domestic industries, and feudal agriculture, into capitalist enterprises. It
develops the product into a commodity, partly by creating a market for it, and
partly by introducing new commodity equivalents and supplying production with
new raw and auxiliary materials, thereby opening new branches of production
based from the first upon commerce, both as concerns production for the home and
world-market, and as concerns conditions of production originating in the
world-market. As soon as manufacture gains sufficient strength, and particularly
large-scale industry, it creates in its turn a market for itself, by capturing
it through its commodities. At this point commerce becomes the servant of
industrial production, for which continued expansion of the market becomes a
vital necessity. Ever more extended mass production floods the existing market
and thereby works continually for a still greater expansion of this market for
breaking out of its limits. What restricts this mass production is not commerce
(in so far as it expresses the existing demand), but the magnitude of employed
capital and the level of development of the productivity of labour. The
industrial capitalist always has the world-market before him, compares, and must
constantly compare, his own cost-prices with the market-prices at home, and
throughout the world. In the earlier period such comparison fell almost entirely
to the merchants, and thus secured the predominance of merchant's capital over
industrial capital.</p>
<p>The first theoretical treatment of the modern mode of production — the
mercantile system — proceeded necessarily from the superficial phenomena of
the circulation process as individualised in the movements of merchant's
capital, and therefore grasped only the appearance of matters. Partly because
merchant's capital is the first free state of existence of capital in general.
And partly because of the overwhelming influence which it exerted during the
first revolutionising period of feudal production — the genesis of modern
production. The real science of modern economy only begins when the theoretical
analysis passes from the process of circulation to the process of production.
Interest-bearing capital is, indeed, likewise a very old form of capital. But we
shall see later why mercantilism does not take it as its point of departure, but
rather carries on a polemic against it.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="information">
<a href="#1a" id="1"><span class="info">1.</span></a> The sage Mr. Roscher [<i>Die Grundlagen
der Nationalökonomie, </i>3. Auflage, 1858, § 60, 5. <i>103. — Ed.</i>]
has figured out that, since certain people designate trade as <i>mediation</i> between producers and consumers, "one" might just as well designate production itself as <i>mediation</i> of consumption (between whom?), and this implies, of course, that merchant's capital is as much a part of productive capital as
agricultural and industrial capital. In other words, because I can say, that man
can mediate his consumption only by means of production (and he has to do this
even without getting his education at Leipzig), or that labour is required for
the appropriation of the products of Nature (which might be called <i>mediation</i>),
it follows, of course, that social <i>mediation</i> arising from a specific
social form of production — because mediation — has the same absolute character of
necessity, and the same rank. The word <i>mediation</i> settles everything. By
the way, the merchants are not mediators between producers and consumers
(consumers as distinct from producers, consumers, that is, who do not produce,
are left aside for the moment), but mediators in the exchange of the products of
these producers among themselves. They are but middlemen in an exchange, which
in thousands of cases proceeds without them. </p>
<p class="information">
<a href="#2a" id="2"><span class="info">2.</span></a> Herr W. Kiesselbach (in his <i>Der Gang
des Welthandels im Mittelalter,</i> 1860) is indeed still enwrapped in the ideas
of a world, in which merchant's capital is the general form of capital. He has
not the least idea of the modern meaning of capital, any more than Mommsen when
he speaks in his history of Rome of "capital" and the rule of capital.
In modern English history, the commercial estate proper and the merchant towns
are also politically reactionary and in league with the landed and moneyed
interest against industrial capital. Compare, for instance, the political role
of Liverpool with that of Manchester and Birmingham. The complete rule of
industrial capital was not acknowledged by English merchant's capital and
moneyed interest until after the abolition of the corn tax, etc. </p>
<p class="information">
<a href="#3a" id="3"><span class="info">3.</span></a> "The inhabitants of trading cities,
by importing the improved manufactures and expensive luxuries of richer
countries afforded some food to the vanity of the great proprietors, who eagerly
purchased them with great quantities of the rude produce of their own lands. The
commerce of a great part of Europe in those times, accordingly consisted
chiefly, in the exchange of their own rude produce for the manufactured produce
of more civilised nations.... When this taste became so general as to occasion a
considerable demand, the merchants, in order to save the expense of carriage,
naturally endeavoured to establish some manufactures of the same kind in their
own country." (Adam Smith [<i>Wealth of Nations</i>], Book III, Ch. III,

complaint about the nobles, or robbers, because they must trade under great
danger and run the risk of being kidnapped, beaten, blackmailed, and robbed. If
they would suffer these things for the sake of justice, the merchants would be
saintly people.... But since such great wrong and unchristian thievery and
robbery are committed all over the world by merchants, and even among
themselves, is it any wonder that God should procure that such great wealth,
gained by wrong, should again be lost or stolen, and they themselves be hit over
the head or made prisoner? ... And the princes should punish such unjust bargains
with due rigour and take care that their subjects shall not be so outrageously
abused by merchants. Because they fail to do so, God employs knights and
robbers, and punishes the merchants through them for the wrongs they committed,
and uses them as his devils, just as he plagues Egypt and all the world with
devils, or destroys through enemies. He thus pits one against the other, without
thereby insinuating that knights are any the less robbers than merchants,
although the merchants daily rob the whole world, while a knight may rob one or
two once or twice a year." "Go by the word of Isaiah: Thy princes have
become the companions of robbers. For they hang the thieves, who have stolen a
gulden or a half gulden, but they associate with those, who rob all the world
and steal with greater assurance than all others, so that the proverb remains
true: Big thieves hang little thieves; and as the Roman senator Cato said: Mean
thieves lie in prisons and stocks, but public thieves are clothed in gold and
silks. But what will God say finally? He will do as he said to Ezekiel; he will
amalgamate princes and merchants, one thief with another, like lead and iron, as
when a city burns down, leaving neither princes nor merchants." (Martin
Luther, <i>Von Kaufshandlung und Wucher,</i> 1524, S. 296-97.) </p>

<a href="#5a" id="5"><span class="info">5.</span></a> How predominant fishery, manufacture and
agriculture, aside from other circumstances, were as the basis for Holland's
development, has already been explained by 18th-century writers, such as Massie
[p. 60]. In contradistinction to the former view, which underrated the volume
and importance of commerce in Asia, in Antiquity, and in the Middle Ages, it has
now come to be the custom to extremely overrate it. The best antidote against
this conception is to study the imports and exports of England in the early 18th
century and to compare them with modern imports and exports. And yet they were
incomparably greater than those of any former trading nation. (See Anderson,
<i>An Historical and Chronological Deduction of the Origin of Commerce.</i> [Vol. II, London, 1764, p. 261 et seq. — Ed.]) </p>

practice infamous) economic experiments. In Bengal they created a caricature of
large-scale English landed estates; in south-eastern India a caricature of small
parcelled property; in the north-west they did all they could to transform the
Indian economic community with common ownership of the soil into a caricature of
itself.</p>

exertions to develop its own capitalist production, which is exclusively
dependent upon its domestic and the neighbouring Asiatic market, this is also
beginning to change. — <i>F.E</i>.</p>

<a href="#8a" id="8"><span class="info">8.</span></a> The same is true of the ribbon and
basting makers and the silk weavers of the Rhine. Even a railway has been built
near Krefeld for the intercourse of these rural hand-weavers with the town "manufacturer."

But this was later put out of business, together with the hand-weavers, by the
mechanical weaving industry. — <i>F.E.</i></p>

<h4>London, 5 October 1852, 28 Dean Street, Soho</h4>
<p>Dear Cluss,</p>
<p>Your letter of 16 September arrived very late today. I am therefore sending only a few lines in reply, since you ask for an answer by return. Next Friday a rather more substantial report will be going off to you. My information about the Brüningk woman (she’s not a spy but corresponds with her aunt, the Princess Lieven, in Paris, who is notoriously one) came from Bangya. The latter, however, has <i>very important reasons</i> for not being named. If he were, he would forfeit many ‘sources of information’ which, being important to us, must be preserved.</p>
<p>You can write and tell Schnauffer that he merely has to answer that no further authorities need be cited since his (Brüningk’s) two <i>friends, Kinkel and Willich</i>, have themselves been spreading it about in London that Mrs von Brüningk has suspect political connections.</p>
<p>That <i>Willich</i> has been saying things of this kind is so well known that Schimmelpfennig has taken him to task about it. If necessary, witnesses can be cited to support this.</p>
<p><i>Kinkel</i> voiced this suspicion outright, e.g. to his friend Kamm, the brushmaker (from Bonn), when the latter passed through here on his way to America. Kamm helped to spread it further.</p>
<p>(Willich, of course, did not discover that the woman was suspect until after she had dropped him.)</p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. M.</p>

<h4>January 16, 1852</h4>
<p class="fst">On the other hand, I enclose a poem and a private letter from Freiligrath. I now request you to do the following: 1. Have the poem printed properly with reasonable spacing between the stanzas. Do not try to save space. Poems lose a great deal if they are printed in a cramped and conglomerate fashion. 2. Write Freiligrath a friendly letter. You do not have to be too sparing with compliments, for all poets, even the best ones, are plus <i>au moins </i><span class="context">[more or less]</span><i> courtisanes </i>and <i>il faut les cajoler, pour les faire chanter</i>. <span class="context">[one must cajole them to make them sing]</span> Our F[reiligrath] is the most amiable, unassuming man in private life, who beneath his real <i>bonhomie </i>conceals <i>un esprit tres fin et tres railleur;</i><span class="context"> [an extremely keen and scornful mind]</span> his emotion is “truthful” and does not make him “uncritical” and “superstitious.” He is a genuine revolutionary and an honest man through and through — and this can be said of few men. Nevertheless, whatever kind of <i>homme </i>he is, the poet needs praise and admiration. I believe that the genre itself requires this. I am telling you all this simply to point out that in your correspondence with Freiligrath, you should not forget the difference between the “poet” and the “critic.”</p>

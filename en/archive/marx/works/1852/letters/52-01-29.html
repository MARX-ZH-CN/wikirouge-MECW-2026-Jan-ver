<h4>Manchester, 29 January 1852</h4>
<p>Dear Marx,</p>
<p>How annoying that one cannot rely on anything being done unless one does it oneself. Owing to our messenger’s stupidity, my letter to <i>The Daily News </i>did not go off yesterday; now it’s too late. So all I can do is to keep it in abeyance until I see whether yours is in tomorrow’s or Saturday’s <i>Times</i>. If not, it will go off at once. In the meantime there’s one thing to consider: whether <i>Freiligrath</i> is not the right man for <i>The D. News. </i>Were he to write to them, I could try <i>The Weekly Press </i>and <i>The Sun</i>. We have been cold-shouldered by <i>The D. N. </i>once already.</p>
<p>Enclosed another article for Dana. It might, perhaps, be divided into two at the point where the Polish business ends — though it would be better to keep it entire. If you split it up, you can send both halves by the same <strong>steamer</strong>, since there is not another sailing before tomorrow week. I will now see that I get on fairly quickly, <strong>say</strong>, 2 articles a week, so as to have done with the <strong>subject</strong>. There will be 15-16 articles in all.</p>
<p>No copies received from Weydemeyer. No letter either. This surprises me. I shall finish another article for him this evening.</p>
<p>The French are real jackasses. Madier approached me about an industrial matter and, since my brother-in-law <span class="context">[Emil Blank]</span> who knows the <strong>dodge</strong>, happened to be here, I gave him some very useful hints and advice. Now the dolt writes to say that, as a result of silly chatter by some <i>crapaud</i> <span class="context">[toad]</span> who knows nothing of this matter, he intends to go about it in a different and <strong>most businesslike</strong> way, and I am to obtain, not for him, but for his associate, a man whom I have never seen, letters of introduction from my brother-in-law (who, fortunately, is on the Continent)! You will recall that Madier introduced us to a calico printer who was bound for Manchester. The fellow calls on me, I go to immense pains to be helpful, do what I can, treat him with the utmost consideration, and in return for all this the dolt suddenly vanishes without my being able to learn what has become of him. A fine race!</p>

<h1>Heroes of the Exile</h1>
<a id="12"></a>
<h1>XII</h1>
<p class="fst">The Great Industrial Exhibition inaugurated a new epoch in the
Emigration. The great throng of German Philistines that flooded into London
during the summer, felt ill at ease in the bustle of the great Crystal Palace
and in the even larger town of London with its noise, its din and its clamour.
And when the toil and the labour of the day, the dutiful inspection of the
Exhibition and the other sights had been completed in the sweat of his brow,
the German Philistine could recover at his ease with Schärttner at the Hanau or
Göhringer at the Star, with their beery cosiness, their smoke-filled fug and
their public-house politics. Here “the whole of the fatherland could be
seen” and in addition all the greatest men of Germany could be seen
gratis. There they all sat, the members of parliament, the deputies of
Chambers, the generals, the Club orators of the halcyon days of 1848 and 1849,
they smoked their pipes just like ordinary people and debated the loftiest
interests of the fatherland day after day, in public and with unshakeable
dignity. This was the place where for the price of a few bottles of extremely
cheap wine the German citizen could discover exactly what went on at the most
secret meetings of the European cabinets. This was the place where he could
learn to within a minute when “it would all start”. In the meantime
one bottle after another was started and all the Parties went home unsteadily
but strengthened in the knowledge that they had made their contribution to the
salvation of the fatherland. Never has the Emigration drunk more and cheaper
than during the period when the solvent masses of German Philistines were in
London.</p>
<p>The true organisation of the Emigration was in fact this <i>tavern
organisation</i> presided over by Silenus-Schärttner in Long Acre which
experienced its heyday thanks to the Exhibition. Here the true Central
Committee sat in perpetual session. All other committees, organisations,
party-formations were just trimmings, the patriotic arabesques of this primeval
German tavern society of idlers.</p>
<p>In addition the Emigration was strengthened numerically at the time by the
arrival of Messrs. Meyen, Faucher, Sigel, Goegg and Fickler, etc.</p>
<p><i>Meyen</i> was a little porcupine who had come into the world without
any quills and who under the name Poinsinet, was once described by Goethe in
this way:</p>
<p class="indentb">“In literature, as in society, one often encounters
such curious little mannikins. Endowed with some small talent they endeavour
always to claim the attention of the public and as they can easily be seen
through by all they are the source of much amusement. However, they always
manage to profit sufficiently. They live, produce, are mentioned everywhere and
are even accorded a favourable reception. Their failures do not disconcert
them; they regard them as exceptional and look to the future for greater
success. Poinsinet is a figure of this sort in the French literary world. It
goes almost beyond belief to see what has been done with him, how he has been
fooled and mystified and even his sad death by drowning in Spain does not
diminish the ridiculous impression made by his life, just as a frog made of
fireworks does not attain to dignity by concluding a lengthy series of sputters
with a loud bang.” <a href="notes.html#n58" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[58]</sup></a></p>
<p class="fst">Writers contemporary with him pass on the following information:
Eduard Meyen belonged to the “Resolute” group which represented the
Berliner intelligentsia as against the mass stupidity of the rest of Germany.
He too had a Maybug Club in Berlin with his friends Mügge, Klein, Zabel, Buhl
etc. Each of these maybugs sat on his own little leaf <span class="context">[<i>Blättchen — "leaf"</i> and "newspaper"]</span>.
Eduard Meyen’s paper was called the <i>Mannheimer Abendblättchen</i>
and here, every week, after enormous efforts, he deposited a small green turd
of correspondence. Our Maybug really did progress to the point where he was
<i>about</i> to publish a monthly periodical; contributions from various
people landed on his desk, the publisher waited but the whole project collapsed
because Eduard after eight months in cold sweat declared that he could not
finish the prospectus. As Eduard took all his childish activities seriously he
was widely regarded in Berlin after the March Revolution as a man who meant
business. In London he worked together with Faucher on a German edition of the
<i>Illustrated London News</i> under the editorship and censorship of an old
woman who had known some German twenty years before, but he was discarded as
useless after he had attempted with great tenacity to insert a profound article
about sculpture that he had had published ten years previously in Berlin. But
when, later on, the Kinkel-emigration made him their secretary he realised that
he was really a practical <i>homme d'état</i> and he announced in a
lithographed leaflet that he had arrived at the “tranquillity of a point
of view”. After his death a whole heap of titles for future projects will
be found among his papers.</p>
<p>Conjointly with Meyen we must necessarily consider <i>Oppenheim</i>, his
co-editor and co-secretary. It has been claimed that Oppenheim is not so much a
man as an allegorical figure: the goddess of boredom it is reported, came down
to Frankfurt on Main and assumed the shape of this son of a Jewish jeweller.
When Voltaire wrote: <i>“Tous les genres vent loons, excepté legenre
ennuyeux”</i>, he must have had a premonition of our Heinrich Bernhard
Oppenheim. We prefer Oppenheim the writer to Oppenheim the orator. His writings
may be avoided, but his spoken delivery — <i>c’est
impossible.</i> The pythagorean metempsychosis may have some foundation in
reality but the name borne by Heinrich Bernhard Oppenheim in former ages can no
longer be discovered as no man ever made a name for himself through being an
unbearable chatterbox. His life may be epitomised by its three climactic
moments: Arnold Ruge’s editor — Brentano’s editor —
Kinkel’s editor.</p>
<p>The third member of the trio is Mr. Julius Faucher. He is one of those
Berlin Huguenots who know how to exploit their minor talent with great
commercial adroitness. He made his public debut as the Lieutenant Pistol of the
Free Trade Party in which capacity he was employed by Hamburg commercial
interests to make propaganda. During the revolutionary disturbances they
allowed him to preach free trade in the apparently chaotic form of anarchism.
When this ceased to be relevant to the times he was dismissed and, together
with Meyen, he became joint editor of the Berlin <i>Abendpost.</i> Under the
presence of wishing to abolish the state and introduce anarchy he refrained
from dangerous opposition towards the existing government and when, later on,
the paper failed because it could no longer afford the deposit, the <i>Neue
Preussische Zeitung</i> commiserated with Faucher, the only able writer among
the democrats. This cosy relationship with the <i>Neue Preussische
Zeitung</i> soon became so intimate that Faucher began to act as its
correspondent in London. Faucher’s activity in the London Emigration did
not last long; his free trade inclined him towards commerce where he found his
true calling, to which he returned with great energy and in which he achieved
wonders never seen before: namely a price-list that assesses goods according to
a completely sliding scale. As is well known, the <i>Breslauer Zeitung</i>
was indiscreet enough to inform the general public of this document.</p>
<p>This three-star constellation of the Berlin intelligentsia can be contrasted
with the three-star constellation of wholesome South German principles: Sigel,
Fickler, Goegg. Franz Sigel, whom his friend Goegg describes as a short,
beardless man, bearing a strong resemblance to Napoleon, is, again according to
Goegg, “a hero”, “a man of the future”, “above
all a genius, intellectually creative and constantly hatching new
plans”.</p>
<p>Between ourselves, General Siegel is a young Baden lieutenant of principle
and ambition. He read in an account of the campaigns of the French Revolution
that the step from sub-lieutenant to supreme general is mere child's play and
from that moment on this little beardless man firmly believed that Franz Sigel
must become supreme commander in a revolutionary army. His wish was granted
thanks to the Baden insurrection of 1849 and a popularity with the army arising
from a confusion of names. The battles he fought on the Neckar and did not
fight in the Black Forest are well known; his retreat to Switzerland has been
praised even by the enemy as a timely and correct manoeuvre. His military plans
here bear witness to his study of the [French] Revolutionary Wars. In order to
remain faithful to the revolutionary tradition Hero Sigel, ignoring the enemy
and operational and withdrawal lines and similar bagatelles, went
conscientiously from one Moreau position to the next. And if he did not manage
to parody Moreau's campaigns <a href="notes.html#n59" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[59]</sup></a> in every detail, if he crossed the Rhine at
Eglichau and not at Paradies, this was the fault of the enemy who was too
ignorant to appreciate such a learned manoeuvre. In his orders of the day and
in his instructions Sigel emerges as a preacher and if he has an inferior style
to Napoleon, he has more principle. Later, he concerned himself with devising a
handbook for revolutionary officers in all branches of warfare from which we
are in a position to offer the following important extract:</p>
<p class="indentb">“an officer of the revolution must carry the following
articles according to regulations: 1 head-covering and cap, 1 sabre with belt,
1 black, red and yellow <a href="notes.html#n60" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[60]</sup></a>
camel-hair sash, 2 pairs of black leather gloves, 2 battle coats, 1 cloak, 1
pair cloth trousers, 1 tie, 2 pairs of boots or shoes, 1 black leather
travelling case — 12" wide, 10" high, 4" deep, 6 shirts, 3 pairs of
underpants, 8 pairs of socks, 6 handkerchiefs, 2 towels, 1 washing and shaving
kit, 1 writing implement, 1 writing tablet with letters patent, 1 clothes
brush, 1 copy of service regulations.”</p>
<p class="fst">Joseph <i>Fickler —</i></p>
<p class="indentb">“the model of a decent, resolute, imperturbably
tenacious man of the people whom the people of the whole Baden upland and the
Lake District supported as one man and whose struggles and sufferings over many
years had earned him a popularity approaching that of Brentano”
(according to the testimony of his friend Goegg).</p>
<p class="fst">As befits a decent, resolute, imperturbably tenacious man of the
people, Joseph Fickler has a fleshy full-moon face, a fat craw and a paunch to
match. The only fact known about his early life is that he earned a livelihood
with the aid of a carving from the 15th century and with relics relating to the
Council of Constance. He allowed travellers and foreign art-lovers to inspect
these curiosities in exchange for money and incidentally sold them
“antique” souvenirs of which Fickler, as he loved to relate, would
constantly make up a new supply in all their authentic
“antiquity”.</p>
<p>His only deeds during the Revolution were firstly his arrest by Mathy <a href="notes.html#n61" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[61]</sup></a> after the Vorparlament,
and, second, his arrest by Romer in Stuttgart in June 1849. Thanks to these
arrests he was happily deprived of the opportunity to compromise himself. The
Württemberg democrats deposited 1000 guilders as bail for him, whereupon
Fickler went to Thurgau incognito and to the great distress of his guarantors
no more was heard of him. It is undeniable that he successfully translated the
feelings and opinions of the lakeside peasants into printers' ink in his
<i>Lake Journals;</i> for the rest he shares the opinion of his friend Ruge
that much study makes you stupid and for this reason he warned his friend Goegg
not to visit the library of the British Museum.</p>
<p><i>Amandus Goegg</i>, lovable, as his name indicates, is no great orator,
but “an unassuming citizen whose noble and modest bearing earns him the
friendship of people everywhere” <i>(Westamerikanische Blätter).</i> From
sheer nobility Goegg became a member of the provisional government in Baden,
where, as he admits, he could do nothing against Brentano and in all modesty he
assumed the title of Dictator. No one denies that his achievements as Finance
Minister were modest. In all modesty he proclaimed the “Social-democratic
Republic” in Donaueschingen the day before the final retreat to Switzerland
actually took place, although it had been decreed before. In all modesty he
later declared (See Janus by Heinzen, 1852) that the Paris proletariat had lost
on December 2 because it did not possess his own Franco-Badenese democratic
experience nor the insights available elsewhere in the frenchified Germany of
the South. Anyone who desires further proofs of Goegg’s modesty and of the
existence of a “Goegg Party” will find them in the book <i>The Baden
Revolution in Retrospect.</i> Paris 1850, written by himself. A fitting climax
to his modesty came in a public meeting in Cincinnati when he declared that
“reputable men came to him after the bankruptcy of the Baden Revolution and had
announced that in that revolution men of all the German tribes had taken an
active part. It was therefore to be regarded as a German matter just as the
Rome uprising was of concern to the whole of Italy. As he was the man who had
held out they said that he must become the <i>German Mazzini</i>. His modesty
compelled him to refuse.”</p>
<p>Why? A man who was once “dictator” and who to cap it all, is the bosom
friend of “Napoleon” Sigel, could surely also become the “German Mazzini”.</p>
<p>Once the Emigration was augmented by these and similar, less noteworthy
arrivals, it could proceed to those mighty battles that the reader shall learn
of in the next canto.</p>

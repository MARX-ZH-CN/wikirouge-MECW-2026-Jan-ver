<h1>III</h1>
<p class="fst">With his capture a new epoch opened in Kinkel's life and at the
same time there began a new era in the history of German Philistinism. The
Maybug Club had scarcely heard the news of his capture than they wrote to all
the German papers that Kinkel, the great poet, was in danger of being summarily
shot and exhorting the German people, especially the educated among them, and
above all the women and girls to give their all to save the life of the
imprisoned poet. Kinkel himself composed a poem at about this time, as we are
told, in which he compared himself to "Christ, his friend and teacher", adding:
"My blood is shed for you." From this point on his emblem is the lyre. In this
way Germany suddenly learned that Kinkel was a poet, a great poet moreover, and
from this moment on the mass of German Philistines and aestheticising
drivellers joined in the Farce of the Blue Flower put on by our Heinrich von
Ofterdingen.</p>
<p>In the meantime the Prussians brought him before a military tribunal. For
the first time after a long interval he saw his opportunity to try out one of
those moving appeals to the tear ducts of his audience which — according
to Mockel — had brought him such applause earlier on as an assistant
preacher in Cologne. Cologne too was destined soon to witness his most glorious
performance in this sphere. He made a speech in his own defence before the
tribunal which thanks to the indiscretion of a friend was unfortunately made
available to the public through the medium of the Berlin <i>Abendpost.</i> In
this speech Kinkel "repudiates any connection between his activities and the
filth and the dirt that, as I well know, has latterly attached itself to this
revolution".</p>
<p>After this rabid revolutionary speech Kinkel was sentenced to twenty years
detention in a fortress. As an act of grace this was reduced to prison with
hard labour and he was removed to Naugard where he was employed in spinning
wool and so just as formerly he had appeared with the emblem first of the
rucksack, then the musket and then the lyre, he now appears in association with
the <i>spinning wheel.</i> We shall see him later wandering over the ocean
accompanied by the emblem of the purse.</p>
<p>In the meantime a curious event took place in Germany. It is well known that
the German Philistine is endowed by Nature with a beautiful soul. Now he found
his most cherished illusions cruelly shattered by the hard blows of the year
1849. Not a single hope had become reality and even the fast-beating hearts of
young men began to despair about the fate of the fatherland. Every heart
yielded to a lachrymose torpor and the need began to be felt for a democratic
Christ, for a real or imagined Sufferer who in his torments would bear the sins
of the Philistine world with the patience of a lamb and whose Passion would
epitomise in extreme form the unrestrained but chronic self-pity of the whole
of Philistinism. The Maybug Club, with Mockel at its head, set out to satisfy
this universal need. And indeed, who better fitted for the task of enacting
this great Passion Farce than our captive passion dower, Kinkel at the Spinning
Wheel, this sponge able to absorb endless floods of sentimental tears, who was
in addition preacher, professor of fine arts, deputy, political colporteur,
musketeer, newly discovered poet and old impresario all rolled into one? Kinkel
was the man of the moment and as such he was immediately accepted by the German
Philistines. Every paper abounded in anecdotes, vignettes, poems, reminiscences
of the captive poet, his sufferings in prison were magnified a thousandfold and
took on mythical stature; at least once a month his hair was reported to have
gone grey; in every bourgeois meeting-place and at every tea party he was
remembered with grief; the daughters of the educated classes sighed over his
poems and old maids who knew what unrequited passion is wept freely in various
cities at the thought of his shattered manhood. All other profane victims of
the revolutionary movement, all who had been shot, who had fallen in battle or
who had been imprisoned disappeared into naught beside this one sacrificial
lamb, beside this one hero after the hearts of the Philistines male and female.
For him alone did the rivers of tears flow, and indeed, he alone was able to
respond to them in kind. In short, we have the perfect image, complete in every
detail of the democratic Siegwart epoch which yielded in nothing to the
literary Siegwart epoch of the preceding century and Siegwart-Kinkel never felt
more at home in any role than in this one where he could seem great not because
of what he did but because of what he did not do. He could seem great not by
dint of his strength and his powers of resistance but through his weakness and
spineless behaviour in a situation where his only task was to survive with
decorum and sentiment. Mockel, however, was able and experienced enough to take
practical advantage of the public's soft heart and she immediately organised a
highly efficient industry. She caused all of Gottfried's published and
unpublished works to be printed for they all suddenly became fashionable and
were much in demand; she also found a market for her own life-experiences from
the insect world, e.g., her <i>Story of a Firefly;</i> she employed the
Maybug Strodtmann to assemble Gottfried's most secret diary-feelings and
prostitute them to the public for a considerable sum of money; she organised
collections of every kind and in general she displayed undeniable talent and
great perseverance in converting the feelings of the educated public into hard
cash. In addition she had the great satisfaction "of seeing the greatest men of
Germany, such as Adolf Stahr, meeting daily in her own little room". The climax
of this whole Siegwart mania was to be reached at the Assizes in Cologne where
Gottfried made a guest appearance early in 1850. This was the trial resulting
from the attempted uprising in Siegburg and Kinkel was brought to Cologne for
the occasion. As Gottfried's diaries play such a prominent part in this sketch
it will be appropriate if we insert here an excerpt from the diary of an
eyewitness.</p>
<p class="indentb">"Kinkel's wife visited him in gaol. She welcomed him from
behind the grill with verses; he replied, I understand, in hexameters;
whereupon they both sank to their knees before each other and the prison
inspector, an old sergeant-major, who was standing by wondered whether he was
dealing with madmen or clowns. When asked later by the chief prosecutor about
the content of their conversation he declared that the couple had indeed spoken
German but that he could not make head nor tail of it. Whereupon Mrs. Kinkel is
supposed to have retorted that a man who was so wholly innocent of art and
literature should not be made an inspector."</p>
<p class="fst">Faced with the jury Kinkel wriggled his way out by acting the
pure tearjerker, the poetaster of the Siegwart period of the vintage of
<i>Werther's Sufferings</i>. <a href="notes.html#n27" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[27]</sup></a></p>
<p class="indentb">"Members of the Court, Gentlemen of the Jury — the
blue eyes of my children — the green waters of the Rhine — it is no
dishonour to shake the hand of the proletarian — the pallid lips of the
prisoner — the peaceful air of one's home" — and similar crap: that
was what the whole famous speech amounted to and the public, the jury, the
prosecution and even the police shed their bitterest tears and the trial closed
with a unanimous acquittal and a no less unanimous weeping and wailing. Kinkel
is doubtless a dear, good man but he is also a repulsive mixture of religious,
political and literary reminiscences."</p>
<p class="fst">It's enough to make you sick.</p>
<p>Fortunately this period of misery was soon terminated by the romantic
liberation of Kinkel from Spandua gaol. His escape was a re-enactment of the
story of Richard Lionheart and Blondel with the difference that this time it
was Blondel who was in prison while Lionheart played on the barrel-organ
outside and that Blondel was an ordinary music-hall minstrel and the lion was
basically more like a rabbit. Lionheart was in fact the student Schurz from the
Maybug Club, a little intriguer with great ambitions and limited achievements
who was however intelligent enough to have seen through the "German Lamartine"!
Not long after the escape student Schurz declared in Paris that he knew very
well that Kinkel was no lumen mundi, whereas he, Schurz, and none other was
destined to be the future president of the German Republic. This mannikin, one
of those students "in brown jackets and pale-blue overcoats" whom Gottfried had
once followed with his gloomily flashing eyes succeeded in freeing Kinkel at
the cost of sacrificing some poor devil of a warder who is now doing time
elevated by the feeling of being a martyr for freedom — the freedom of
Gottfried Kinkel.</p>

<p class="fst">To show how pleasantly the war was waged between Emigration and
Agitation we append here a few excerpts from the German-American papers.</p>
<p><b><i>Agitation.</i></b></p>
<p>Ruge declared that Kinkel was an “agent of the Prince of Prussia”. Another
agitator discovered that the outstanding men of the Émigré Club consisted of
“Pastor Kinkel together with three Prussian lieutenants, two mediocre Berlin
literati and one student”.</p>
<p>Sigel wrote: “It cannot be denied that Willich has gained some support. But
when a man has been a preacher for three years and only tells people what they
wish to hear, he would have to be very stupid not to be able to win some of
them over. The Kinkelites are attempting to take these supporters over. The
Willich supporters are whoring with the Kinkel supporters.”</p>
<p>A fourth agitator declared that Kinkel's supporters are “idolators”.
Tausenau gave this description of the Émigré Club.</p>
<p class="indentb">“Divergent interests beneath the mask of conciliatoriness,
the systematic gerrymandering of majorities, the emergence of unknown
quantities as organising party leaders, attempts to impose a secret finance
committee and all the other slippery manoeuvres with which <i>immature
politicians</i> of all ages have tried to control the fates of their country
in exile, while the first glow of the revolution disperses all such vanities
like a morning mist.”</p>
<p class="fst">Lastly, Rodomonte-Heinzen announced that the only reputable
refugees in England personally known to him were Ruge, Goegg, Fickler and
Sigel. The members of the Émigré Club were “egoists, royalists and communists”.
Kinkel was “an incurably vain fool and an aristocratic adventurer”, Meyen,
Oppenheim and Willich, etc. were people “who do not even come up to his,
Heinzen's, knee and as for Ruge, they do not even reach to his ankle”. (New
York <i>Schnellpost, New-Yorker Deutsche Zeitung, Wecker</i>, etc. 1851.)</p>
<p><b><i>Emigration</i></b></p>
<p class="indentb">“What is the purpose of an imposed committee, that stands
firmly in mid-air, that confers authority on itself without consulting the
people whom it claims to represent or asking them whether they wish to be
represented by such people?” — “Everyone who knows Ruge, knows that the
mania for proclamations is his incurable disease.” — “In parliament Ruge
did not even acquire the influence of a Simon of Trier or a Raveaux.” <a href="notes.html#n70" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[70]</sup></a> “Where revolutionary energy in action, talent for
organisation, discretion or reticence are necessary, Ruge is downright
dangerous because he cannot hold his tongue, he cannot hold his ink and always
claims that he represents everybody. When Ruge meets Mazzini and Ledru-Rollin
this is translated into Rugean and published in all the papers as: Germany,
France and Italy have banded together fraternally to serve the revolution.”
— “This pretentious imposition of a committee, this boastful inactivity
determined Ruge’s most intimate and intelligent friends, such as Oppenheim,
Meyen and Schramm to join forces with other men.” “Behind Ruge there is no
clearly defined section of the people, but only a clearly outlined pigtail of
peace.” — “How many hundreds of people ask themselves daily who is this
Tausenau and there is no one, no one who can give an answer. Here and there you
can find a Viennese who will assure you that he is one of those democrats with
whom the reaction used to reproach the Viennese democrats so as to put them in
a bad light. But that is the concern of the Viennese. At any rate Tausenau is
an unknown quantity, and whether he is a quantity of any kind is even more
dubious.”</p>
<p>“Let us take a look at these worthy men who regard everyone else as an
immature politician. Sigel, the supreme commander. If anyone ever asks the muse
of history how such an insipid nonentity was given the supreme command she will
be completely at a loss for a reply. Sigel is only his brother's brother. His
brother became a popular officer as a result of his critical remarks about the
government, remarks which had been provoked by his frequent arrests for
disorderly behaviour. The younger Sigel thought this reason enough in the early
confusion prevailing at the outbreak of revolution to proclaim himself supreme
commander and minister of war. The Baden artillery which had often proved its
worth had plenty of older and more experienced officers who should have taken
precedence over this young milksop Lieutenant Sigel, and they were more than a
little indignant when they had to obey an unknown man whose inexperience was
only matched by his incompetence. But there was Brentano, who was so mindless
and treacherous as to permit anything that might ruin the revolution .... The
total incapacity that Sigel displayed during the whole Baden campaign .... It
is worthy of note that Sigel left the bravest soldiers of the republican army
in the lurch in Rastatt and in the Black Forest without the reinforcements he
had <i>promised</i> while he himself drove around Zurich with the epaulettes
and the carriage of Prince von Furstenberg and paraded as an interesting
unfortunate supreme commander. This is the true magnitude of this mature
politician who, understandably proud of his earlier heroic deeds, imposed
himself as supreme commander for a second time, on this occasion in the
Agitators’ Club. This is the great hero, the brother of his brother.”</p>
<p>“It is really laughable when such people” (as the Agitators) “reproach
others with half-heartedness, for they are <i>political nonentities</i> who
are neither half nor whole.” — “Personal ambition is the whole secret of
their fundamental position.” — “As a club the Agitators’ Club has meaning
only as a private institution, like a literary circle or a billiard club, and
therefore it has no claim to be taken into consideration or given a voice.”
— “You have cast the dice! Let the uninitiated be initiated so that they
may judge for themselves what kind of people you are!” — (Baltimore
<i>Correspondent.)</i></p>
<p class="fst">It must be confessed that in their understanding of each other
these gentlemen have almost achieved an understanding of themselves.</p>

<h1>XV</h1>
<p class="fst">In the meantime the secret finance committee of the “Émigrés”
had elected an executive committee consisting of Kinkel, Willich and
Reichenbach and it now resolved to take serious measures in connection
with the German loan. As reported in the New York <i>Schnellpost</i>, the
<i>New-Yorker Deutsche Zeitung</i> and the Baltimore <i>Correspondent</i>
at the end of 1851, Student Schurz was sent on a mission to France, Belgium and
Switzerland where he sought out all old, forgotten, dead and missing
parliamentarians, Reichregents, deputies and other distinguished men, right
down to the late lamented Raveaux, to get them to guarantee the loan. The
forgotten wretches hastened to give their guarantee. For what else was the
guarantee of the loan if not a mutual guarantee of government posts in
partibus; and in the same way Messrs. Kinkel, Willich and Reichenbach obtained
by this means guarantees of <i>their</i> future prospects. And these
sorrowing bonhommes in Switzerland were so obsessed with “organisation” and the
guarantee of future posts that they had long before worked out a plan by which
government posts would be awarded according to seniority — which produced
a terrible scandal about who were to have Nos. 1, 2 and 3. Suffice it to say
that Student Schurz brought back the guarantee in his pocket and so they all
went to work. Some days earlier Kinkel had, it is true, promised in another
meeting with the “Agitators” that he would not go ahead with a loan without
them. For that very reason he departed taking the signatures of the guarantors
and <i>carte blanche</i> from Reichenbach and Willich — ostensibly to
find customers for his aesthetic lectures in the north of England, but in
reality to go to Liverpool and embark for New York where he hoped to play
Parzival and to discover the <i>Holy Grail</i>, the gold of the democratic
parties.</p>
<p>And now begins that sweet-sounding, strange, magniloquent, fabulous, true
and adventurous history of the great battles fought on both sides of the
Atlantic Ocean between the Émigrés and the Agitators. It was a war waged with
renewed bitterness and with indefatigable zeal. In it we witness Gottfried's
crusade in the course of which he contends with Kossuth and after great labours
and indescribable temptations he finally returns home with the Grail in the
bag.</p>
<p class="indentb">Or bei signori, io vi lascio al presente, <br>
E se voi tornerete in questo loco, <br>
Diro questa baffaglia dov'io lasso <br>
Ch'un altra nofu mai di tal fracasso.</p>
<p class="quote">(Boiardo, Bk I, Canto 26)</p>
<p class="indentb">[And there, kind Sirs, I leave you for the present, <br>
If one day you return unto this place <br>
I'll give you further news of this great war <br>
So full of mighty deeds ne'er done before.]</p>

<h1>II</h1>
<p class="fst">This brings to a close the first Act of the drama of Kinkel's
life and nothing worthy of mention then occurs before the outbreak of the
February Revolution. The publishing house of Cotta accepted his poems but
without offering him a royalty and most of the copies remained unsold until the
celebrated stray bullet in Baden gave a poetic nimbus to the author and created
a market for his products.</p>
<p>Incidentally, our biographer omits mention of one momentous fact. The
self-confessed goal of Kinkel's desires was that he should die as an old
theatre director: his ideal was a certain old Eisenhut who together with his
troupe used to roam up and down the Rhine as a travelling Pickelhäring [<span class="context">clown</span>] and who afterwards went mad.</p>
<p>Alongside his lectures with their rhetoric of the pulpit Gottfried also gave
a number of theological and aesthetic performances in Cologne from time to
time. When the February Revolution broke out, he concluded them with this
prophetic utterance:</p>
<p class="indentb">"The thunder of battle reverberates over to us from Paris and
opens a new and glorious era for Germany and the whole continent of Europe. The
raging storm will be followed by Zephyr's breezes with their message of
freedom. On this day is born the great, bountiful epoch of —
<i>constitutional monarchy!"</i></p>
<p class="fst">The constitutional monarchy expressed its thanks to Kinkel for
this compliment by appointing him to a professorial chair. Such recognition
could however not suffice for our <i>grand homme en herbe.</i> The
constitutional monarchy showed no eagerness to cause his "fame to encircle the
globe". Moreover, the laurels Freiligrath had collected for his recent
political poems prevented our crowned Maybug poet from sleeping. Heinrich von
Ofterdingen, therefore, resolved upon a swing to the left and became first a
constitutional democrat and then a republican democrat <i>(honnête et
modéré).</i> He set out to become a deputy but the May elections took him
neither to Berlin nor to Frankfurt. Despite this initial setback he pursued his
objective undismayed and it can truthfully be said that he did not spare
himself. He wisely limited himself at first to his immediate environment. He
founded the <i>Bonner Zeitung</i> [<span class="context">Bonn News</span>], a
modest local product distinguished only by the peculiar feebleness of its
democratic rhetoric and the naivete with which it aspired to save the nation.
He elevated the Maybug Club to the rank of a democratic Students' Club and from
this there duly flowed a host of disciples that bore the Master's renown into
every corner of the district of Bonn, importuning every assembly with the fame
of Professor Kinkel. He himself politicked with the grocers in their club, he
extended a brotherly hand to the worthy manufacturers and even hawked the warm
breath of freedom among the peasantry of Kindenich and Seelscheid. Above all he
reserved his sympathy for the honourable caste of master craftsmen. He wept
together with them over the decay of handicrafts, the monstrous effects of free
competition, the modern dominance of capital and of machines. Together with
them he devised plans to restore the guilds and to prevent the violation of
guild regulations by the journeymen. So as to do everything of which he was
capable he set down the results of his pub deliberations with the petty guild
masters in the pamphlet entitled <i>Handicraft, save yourself!</i></p>
<p>Lest there be any doubt as to Mr. Kinkel's position and to the significance
of his little tract for Frankfurt and the nation he dedicated it to the "thirty
members of the economic committee of the Frankfurt National Assembly".</p>
<p>Heinrich von Ofterdingen's researches into the "beauty" of the artisan class
led him immediately to the discovery that "the whole artisan class is at
present divided by a yawning chasm" (p. 5). This chasm consists in the fact
that some artisans "frequent the clubs of the grocers and officials" (what
progress!) and that others do not do this and also in the fact that some
artisans are educated and others are not. Despite this chasm the author regards
the artisans' clubs, the assemblies springing up everywhere in the beloved
fatherland and the agitation for improving the state of handicrafts
(reminiscent of the congresses à la Winkelblech <a href="notes.html#n24" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[24]</sup></a> of 1848) as the portent of a happy future. To
ensure that his own good advice should not be missing from this beneficent
movement he devises his own programme of salvation.</p>
<p>He begins by asking how to eradicate the evil effects <i>of free
competition</i> by restricting it but without eliminating it altogether. The
solutions he proposes are these:</p>
<p class="indentb">"A youth who lacks the requisite ability and maturity should
be debarred by law from becoming a master" (p. 20).</p>
<p class="indentb">"No master shall be permitted to have more than one
apprentice (p. 29)</p>
<p class="indentb">"The course of instruction in a craft shall be concluded by
an examination" (p. 30).</p>
<p class="indentb">"The master of an apprentice must unfailingly attend the
examination" (p. 31).</p>
<p class="indentb">"On the question of maturity it should become mandatory that
henceforth no apprentice may become a master before completion of his
twenty-fifth year" (p. 42).</p>
<p class="indentb">"As evidence of ability every candidate for the title of
master should be required to pass a public examination" (p. 43).</p>
<p class="indentb">"In this context it is of vital importance that the
examination should be free" (p. 44). "All provincial masters of the same guild
must likewise submit themselves to the same examination" (p. 55).</p>
<p class="fst">Friend Gottfried who is himself a political hawker desires to
abolish the "travelling tradesman or hawker" in other, profane wares on the
grounds of the dishonesty of such work. (p. 60.)</p>
<p class="indentb">"A manufacturer of craft goods desires to withdraw his assets
from the business to his own advantage and, dishonestly, to the disadvantage of
his creditors. Like all ambivalent things this phenomenon too is described by a
foreign word: it is called bankruptcy. He then quickly takes his finished
products to a neighbouring town and sells them there to the highest bidder" (p.
64). These auctions — "in actual fact like a sort of garbage that our
dear neighbour, Commerce, disposes of in the garden of Handicraft" — must
be abolished. (Would it not be much simpler, Friend Gottfried, to go to the
root of the matter and abolish bankruptcy itself?).</p>
<p class="indentb">"Of course, the annual fairs are in a special position" (p.
65). "The law will have to be flexible so as to allow the various places to
call an assembly of all the citizens to decide by majority vote (!) whether
permanent annual fairs should be retained or abolished" (p. 68).</p>
<p class="fst">Gottfried now comes to the "vexed" question of the relationship
between manufacture and machine industry and produces the following:</p>
<p class="indentb">"Let everyone <i>sell only those goods that he himself
produces with his own hands." (p.</i> 80.) "Because machines and manufacture
have gone their own ways they have strayed from their true paths and now both
are in a sorry plight." (p. 84).</p>
<p class="fst">He wishes to unite them by getting artisans such as the
bookbinders, to band together and maintain a machine.</p>
<p class="indentb">"As they only use the machine for themselves and when it is
required they will be able to produce more cheaply than the factory owner" (p.
85). "Capital will be broken by association" (p. 84). (And associations will be
broken by capital.)</p>
<p class="fst">He then generalises his ideas about the "purchase of a machine
to rule lines, and to cut paper and cardboard" (p. 85) for the united
certificated bookbinders of Bonn and conceives the notion of a
"Machine-Chamber".</p>
<p class="indentb">"Confederations of the various guild masters must set up
businesses everywhere, similar to the factories of individual businessmen
though on a smaller scale. These will work to order, exclusively for the
benefit of local masters. They will not accept commissions from other
employers" (p. 86).</p>
<p class="fst">What distinguishes these Machine Chambers is the fact that "a
commercial management" will only "be needed initially" (ibid). "Every idea as
novel as this one", Gottfried exclaims "ecstatically", "can only be put into
practice when all the details have been thought out in the most sober, matter
of fact way". He urges "each and every branch of manufacture to perform this
analysis for itself"! (pp. 87, 88).</p>
<p>There follows a polemic against competition from the state in the shape of
the labour performed by the inmates of prisons, reminiscences about a colony of
criminals ("The creation of a human Siberia" (p. 102)), and finally an attack
on the "so-called handicraft companies and handicraft commissions" in the armed
forces. The aim here is to ease the burdens imposed by the army on the artisan
classes by inducing the state to commission goods from the guild masters that
it could itself produce more cheaply.</p>
<p class="indentb">"This deals satisfactorily with the problems of competition"
(p. 109).</p>
<p class="fst">Gottfried's second important point touches on the material aid
due to the manufacturing classes from the state. Gottfried regards the state
solely from the point of view of an official and hence arrives at the opinion
that the easiest and surest way to help the artisan is by direct subsidy from
the Treasury to erect trade halls and set up loan-funds. How the funds reach
the Treasury in the first place is the "ugly" side of the problem and naturally
enough, cannot be investigated here.</p>
<p>Lastly, our theologian inevitably lapses into the role of moral preacher. He
reads the artisan class a moral lecture on self-help. He firstly condemns the
"complaints about long-term borrowing and about discounts" (p. 136), and
invites the artisan to inspect his own conscience: "Do you always fix the same,
unchanging price, my friend, for every job of work that you undertake?" (p.
132). On this occasion he also warns the artisan against making extortionate
demands on "wealthy Englishmen". "The whole root of the evil", according to the
fantasies that inhabit Gottfried's mind, "is the system of annual accounts" (p.
139). This is followed by Jeremiads about the way in which the artisans carry
on in the taverns and their wives indulge their love of finery (p. 140 ff.).</p>
<p>The means by which the artisan class is to better itself are "the
corporation, the sickness fund and the artisans' court" (p. 146); and lastly,
the workers' educational clubs (p. 153). Here is his closing statement about
these educational clubs.</p>
<p class="indentb">"And finally the union of song and oratory will create a
bridge to <i>dramatic performances</i> and <i>the artisan theatre</i> which
must constantly be kept in view as the ultimate objective of these aesthetic
strivings. Only when the labouring classes learn once more how to move on the
<i>stage</i> will their artistic education be complete (pp. 174-175).</p>
<p class="fst">Gottfried has thus succeeded in changing the artisan into a
comedian and has arrived back at his own situation.</p>
<p>This whole flirtation with the guild aspirations of the master craftsmen in
Bonn did not fail to achieve a practical result. In return for the solemn
promises to promote the cause of the guilds Gottfried's election as Member for
Bonn in the Lower Chamber under the dictated constitution <a href="notes.html#n25" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[25]</sup></a> was contrived. "From
this moment on Gottfried felt happy."</p>
<p>He set off at once for Berlin and as he believed that it was the intention
of the government to establish a permanent "corporation" of approved masters in
the craft of legislation in the Lower Chamber, he acted as if he were to stay
there for ever and even decided to send for his wife and child. But then the
Chamber was dissolved and Friend Gottfried, bitterly disappointed, had to leave
his parliamentary bliss and go back to Mockel.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards conflicts broke out between the Frankfurt Assembly and the
German governments and this led to the upheavals in South Germany and on the
Rhine. The Fatherland called and Gottfried obeyed. Siegburg was the site of the
arsenal for the province and next to Bonn Siegburg was the place where
Gottfried had sown the seed of freedom most frequently. He joined forces with
his friend, Anneke, a former lieutenant and summoned all his loyal vassals to a
march on Siegburg. They were to assemble at the rope ferry. More than a hundred
were supposed to come but when after waiting a long time Gottfried counted the
heads of the faithful there were barely thirty — and of these only three
were students, to the undying shame of the Maybug Club! Undaunted, Gottfried
and his band crossed the Rhine and marched towards Siegburg. The night was dark
and it was drizzling. Suddenly the sound of horses' hooves could be heard
behind our valiant heroes. They took cover at the side of the road, a patrol of
lancers galloped by: miserable knaves had talked too freely and the authorities
had got wind of it. The march was now futile and had to be abandoned. The pain
that Gottfried felt in his breast that night can only be compared with the
torments he experienced when both Knapp and Chamisso declined to print the
first flowering of his poetic talent in their magazines.</p>
<p>After this he could remain no longer in Bonn but surely the Palatinate would
provide great scope for his activities? He went to Kaiserslautern and as he had
to have a job he obtained a sinecure in the War Office (it is said that he was
put in charge of naval affairs). But he continued to earn his living by hawking
around his ideas about freedom and the people's paradise among the peasants of
the region and it is said that his reception in a number of reactionary
districts was anything but cordial. Despite these minor misfortunes Kinkel
could be seen on every highroad, striding along purposefully, his rucksack on
his back and from this point on he appears in all the newspapers accompanied by
his rucksack.</p>
<p>But the upheavals in the Palatinate were quickly terminated and we discover
Kinkel again in Karlsruhe where instead of the rucksack he carries a musket
which now becomes his permanent emblem. This musket is said to have had a very
<i>beautiful</i> aspect, i.e. a butt and stock made of mahogany and it was
certainly an artistic, aesthetic musket; there was also an ugly side to it and
this was the fact that Gottfried could neither load, nor see, nor shoot nor
march. So much so that a friend asked him why he was going into battle at all.
Whereupon Gottfried replied: Well, the fact is that I can't return to Bonn, I
have to live!</p>
<p>In this way Gottfried joined the ranks of the warriors in the corps of the
chivalrous Willich. As a number of his comrades in arms have reliably reported.
Gottfried served as a common partisan, sharing all the vicissitudes of this
company with humility. He was as merry and friendly in bad times as in good,
but he was mostly engaged in marauding. In Rastatt, <a href="notes.html#n26" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[26]</sup></a> however, this unsullied
witness to truth and justice was to undergo the test from which he would emerge
unblemished and as a martyr to the plaudits of the whole German nation. The
exact details of this exploit have never been established with any accuracy.
All that is known is that a troop of partisans got lost in a skirmish and a few
shots were fired on their flank. A bullet grazed Gottfried's head and he fell
to the ground with the cry "I am dead". He was not in fact dead but his wound
was serious enough to prevent him from retreating with the others. He was taken
to a farm house where he turned to the worthy Black Forest peasants with the
words "Save me — I am Kinkel!" Here he was discovered by the Prussians,
who dragged him off into Babylonian captivity.</p>

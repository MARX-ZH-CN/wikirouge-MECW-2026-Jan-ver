<h1>Heroes of the Exile</h1>
<a id="10"></a>
<h1>X</h1>
<p class="fst">Despite his unexpected successes hitherto Arnold had not yet
arrived at the goal of his labours. As Germany's representative by the grace of
Mazzini, he was under the obligation on the one hand to obtain confirmation of
his appointment at least by the German emigration and, on the other hand, to
present the Central Committee with people who respected his leadership. He did
indeed claim that in Germany there was “a clearly defined part of the
people behind him” but this hind portion could scarcely inspire much
confidence in Mazzini and Ledru as long as they could see nothing but the Ruge
front portion. Suffice it to say that Arnold had to look around among the
<i>émigrés</i> for a “clearly defined” tail.</p>
<p>At about this time Gottfried Kinkel came to London and together with him or
soon afterwards a number of other exiles partly from France, partly from
Switzerland and Belgium: Schurz, Strodtmann, Oppenheim, Schimmelpfennig,
Techow, etc. These new arrivals some of whom had already tried their hand at
forming provisional governments in Switzerland, infused new life into the
London emigration and for Arnold the moment seemed more favourable than ever.
At the same time Heinzen again took over the <i>Schnellpost</i> in New York
and so Arnold could now make his “frequent appearances” on the
other side of the ocean and not just in the local Bremen paper. Should Arnold
ever find his Strodtmann the latter would surely declare the monthly numbers of
the <i>Schnellpost</i> from the beginning of 1851 on to be a priceless source
of information. One has to see this infinitely feeble mixture of gossip,
silliness and nastiness, this ant-like self-importance with which Arnold
deposits his dung, for otherwise one would not believe it. While Heinzen
portrays Arnold as a European Great Power, Arnold treats Heinzen as an American
newspaper oracle. He tells him the secrets of European diplomacy and in
particular the latest events in the history of world emigration. Arnold
sometimes figures as the anonymous correspondent in London and Paris in order
to keep the American public informed of some of the great Arnold's fashionable
movements.</p>
<p class="indentb">“Once again Arnold Ruge has the communists by the
throat” — “Arnold Ruge <i>yesterday</i> (dated from Paris
so that the dating gives the old joker away) made an excursion from Brighton to
London.” And again: “Arnold Ruge to Karl Heinzen: Dear Friend and
Editor .... Mazzini sends his greetings ... Ledru-Rollin <i>gives his
permission</i> to translate his pamphlet on the June 13th” and so on.</p>
<p class="fst">A letter from America has this comment to make:</p>
<p class="indentb">“As I see from Ruge's letters in the
<i>Schnellpost</i> Heinzen must be writing Ruge (privately) all sorts of
funny stories about the importance of his paper in America, while Ruge seems to
act as if he were a major European govemment. Whenever Ruge imparts a momentous
piece of information to Heinzen he never omits to add: You can ask other
newspapers to reprint this. As if they would hesitate to print news regardless
of Ruge’s authorisation. Incidentally, I have never seen these momentous
reports actually appear anywhere else despite Ruge's advice and
permission.”</p>
<p class="fst">Father Ruge employed both this paper and the <i>Bremer
TagesChronik to</i> win over new arrivals by flattery: Kinkel is here now, the
patriot and poet of genius; Strodtmann, a great writer; Schurz, a young man as
amiable as he is bold, and a whole array of distinguished revolutionary
warriors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in contrast to the Mazzini Committee a <i>plebeian</i> European
Committee was formed with the support of the “inferior refugees”
and the <i>émigré</i> dregs of the various European nations. At the time of
the battle of Bronzell this committee had issued a manifesto that included the
following outstanding German signatories: Gebert, Majer, Dietz, Schärttner,
Schapper, Willich. This document was couched in peculiar French and contained
the information that at that moment (10 November 1850) the Holy Alliance of
Tyrants had assembled 1,330,000 soldiers backed by another 700,000 armed
lackeys in reserve; that “the German papers and the Committee’s own
contacts” had revealed the secret intentions of the Warsaw Conferences <a href="notes.html#n52" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[52]</sup></a> and that these were to
massacre all the republicans of Europe. This was followed by the inevitable
call to arms. This “manifeste-Faneron-Caperon-Gouté” as it was
described by the <i>Patrie</i> (to whom they sent <i>it)</i> was
overwhelmed with ridicule by the reactionary press. The <i>Patrie</i> called
<i>it</i> “the manifesto of the dii minorum gentium, written without
chic, without style and equipped with only the most banal clichés,
<i>‘serpents’, ‘sicaires’</i> and
<i>‘égorgements’”.</i></p>
<p>The <i>Indépendence Belge</i> states that it was written by the most
obscure soldiers of democracy, poor devils who had sent it to their
correspondent in London even though their paper was conservative. Greatly as
they longed to get into print, they would nevertheless not publish the names of
the signatories as a punishment. Despite their attempts to beg from the
reaction these noble people did not manage to obtain recognition as dangerous
conspirators.</p>
<p>The establishment of this rival firm spurred Arnold on to even greater
efforts. Together with Strave, Kinkel, R. Schramm and Bucher, etc. he tried to
found a <i>Volksfreund</i>, or, if Gustav were to insist, a <i>Deutscher
Zuschauer.</i> But the plan fell through. Partly because our
“good-humoured” Gottfried demanded payment in cash whereas Arnold
shared Hansemann's view that in money matters there is no room for good humour.
Arnold's particular aim was to impose a levy on the Reading Circle, a club of
German watchmakers, well-paid workers and petty bourgeois, but in this too he
was frustrated.</p>
<p>But soon there arose another opportunity for Arnold to make one of his
“frequent appearances”. Ledru and his supporters among the French
<i>émigrés</i> could not let 24 February (1851) <a href="notes.html#n53" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[53]</sup></a> pass without celebrating a “Fraternal
Feast” of the nations of Europe. In fact only the French and the Germans
attended. Mazzini did not come and excused himself by letter: Gottfried who was
present went home fuming because his mute presence failed to produce the
magical effect he expected; Arnold lived to see the day when his friend Ledru
pretended not to know him and became so confused when he arose to speak that he
kept quiet about the French speech he had prepared and which had been approved
in high places; he just stammered a few words in German and retreated
precipitately, exclaiming: À<i>la restauration de la révolution!</i> to the
accompaniment of a general shaking of heads.</p>
<p>On the same day a rival banquet took place under the auspices of the
competing committee referred to above. Annoyed that the Mazzini-Ledru committee
had not invited him to join them from the beginning Louis Blanc took himself
off to the refugee mob, declaring that “the aristocracy of talent must
also be abolished”. The whole lower emigration was thus assembled. The
chivalrous Willich presided. The hall was festooned with flags and the walls
were emblazoned with the names of the greatest men of the people: Waldeck
between Garibaldi and Kossuth, Jacoby between Blanqui and Cabet, Robert Blum
between Barbès and Robespierre. That coquettish ape Louis Blanc read out in a
whining voice an address from his old yes men <span class="context">[German: Ja
Brüder]</span>, the future peers of the social republic, the delegates of the
Luxemburg of 1848. Willich read out an address from Switzerland the signatures
to which had partly been collected under false presences. Later he was
indiscreet enough to publish the address, which resulted in the mass expulsion
of the signatories. From Germany no message had arrived. Then speeches. Despite
the eternal brotherhood boredom could be seen on every face.</p>
<p>The banquet gave rise to a highly edifying scandal which like the heroic
deeds of the European central mob-committee, unfolded within the pages of the
counter-revolutionary press. It had struck observers as very strange that
during the banquet a certain Barthélemy should have given an extremely
grandiose eulogy of <i>Blanqui</i> in the presence of Louis Blanc. The puzzle
was now elucidated. The <i>Patrie</i> printed a toast that Blanqui had sent
from Belle-Île in response to a request from the orator at the banquet. In the
toast he aimed some rough blows at the whole provisional government of 1848 and
at Louis Blanc in particular. The <i>Patrie</i> expressed astonishment that
this toast had been suppressed in the course of the banquet. Louis Blanc at
once wrote to <i>The Times</i> declaring that Blanqui was an abominable
intriguer and had never sent such a toast to the Banquet committee. The
committee consisting of Messrs, Blanc, Willich, Landolphe, Schapper, Barthélemy
and Vidil, announced simultaneously in the <i>Patrie</i> that they had never
received the toast. The <i>Patrie</i>, however, did not allow the declaration
to be printed until they had made inquiries of M. Antoine, Blanqui's
brother-in-law, who had given them the text of the toast. Beneath the
declaration of the Banquet committee they printed M. Antoine's reply: he had
sent the toast to Barthélemy, one of the signatories of the declaration and had
received an acknowledgement from him. Whereupon Mr. Barthélemy was forced to
admit that it was true that he had lied. He had indeed received the toast but
had thought it unsuitable and so had not informed the committee of it. But
before this, behind Barthélemy's back his co-signatory, the French ax-captain
Vidil had also written to the <i>Patrie</i> saying that his honour as a
soldier and his sense of truth compelled him to confess that not only he but
also Louis Blanc, Willich and all the other signatories of the first
declaration had lied. The committee had consisted of 13 members and not 6. They
had all seen Blanqui's toast, they had discussed it and after a long debate
agreed to suppress it by a majority of 7 votes to 6. He had been one who had
voted <i>in favour</i> of reading it in public.</p>
<p>It is easy to imagine the joy of the <i>Patrie</i> when it received
Barthélemy's declaration after Vidil's letter. They printed it with this
preface:</p>
<p class="indentb">“We have often asked ourselves, and it is a difficult
question to answer, whether the demagogues are notable more for their stupidity
or their boastfulness. A fourth letter from London has increased our
perplexity. There they are, we do not know how many poor wretches, who are so
tormented by the longing to write and to see their names published in the
<i>reactionary</i> press that they are undeterred even by the prospect of
infinite humiliation and mortification. What do they care for the laughter and
the indignation of the public — the <i>Journal des Débats</i>, the
<i>Assemblée rationale</i> and the <i>Patrie</i> will find space for their
stylistic exercises; to achieve this no cost to the cause of cosmopolitan
democracy can be too high.... In the name of literary commiseration we include
the following letter from ‘Citizen’ Barthélemy — it is a
novel, and, we hope, the last proof of the authenticity of Blanqui’s
famous toast whose existence they first all denied and now fight among
themselves for the right to acknowledge.”</p>
<a id="11"></a>
<h1>XI</h1>
<p class="fst">“The actual force of events”, to use one of Arnold's
all-pervading beautiful forms, now took the following course. On 24 February,
Ruge had compromised himself and the German <i>émigrés</i> in the presence of
foreigners. Hence the few <i>émigrés</i> who still felt inclined to go along
with him felt insecure and without any support. Arnold <i>put</i> the blame
on the division in the emigration and pressed harder than ever for unity.
Compromised as he was, he still reached eagerly for the chance to compromise
himself further.</p>
<p>Hence the <i>Anniversary of the March revolution in Vienna</i> was used to
give a German banquet. The chivalrous Willich declined the invitation; as he
belonged to “citizen” Louis Blanc he could not collaborate with
“citizen” Ruge who belonged to “citizen&amp;lrquo; Ledru.
Likewise the ex-deputies Reichenbach, Schramm, Bucher, etc., recoiled from
Ruge’s presence. Not counting the silent guests there appeared Mazzini,
Ruge, Struve, Tausenau, Haug, Ronge and Kinkel — all of whom spoke.</p>
<p>Ruge filled the role of “the complete fool” as even his friends
admitted. The German public was however to experience even greater things.
Tausenau’s clowning, Struve’s croaking, Haug’s meanderings,
Ronge’s litanies turned the whole audience to stone and the majority
drifted away even before that flower of rhetoric, Jeremiah-Kinkel, who had been
saved for the dessert, could begin his speech. “In the name of the
martyrs” for the martyrs, Gottfried spoke as a martyr and uttered
lachrymose words of reconciliation to all ’from the simple defender of
the constitution down to the red republican”. At the same time as all
these republicans, and even red republicans, like Kinkel, groaned away in this
fashion, they also knelt down before the English constitution in humble
adoration, a contradiction to which the Morning Chronicle politely drew their
attention the following morning.</p>
<p>The same evening Ruge saw the fulfilment of his desires as can be seen from
a proclamation whose most brilliant sections we offer here:</p>
<p class="indentb">To the Germans!</p>
<p class="indentb">“Brothers and friends in Germany! We, the undersigned,
constitute at present and until such time as you decide differently, the
committee for German affairs" (irrespective which affairs).</p>
<p class="indentb">“The Central Committee of the European democratic
movement has sent us Arnold Ruge, the Baden revolution has sent Gustav Struve,
the Viennese revolution has sent us Ernst Haug, the religious movement has sent
us Johannes Ronge and prison has sent us Gottfried Kinkel, we have invited the
social-democratic workers to send a representative to our midst.</p>
<p class="indentb">“German brothers! Events have deprived you of your
freedom ... we know that you are incapable of abandoning your freedom for ever
and we have omitted nothing" (in the way of committees and manifestoes) "that
might accelerate your recovery of it.</p>
<p class="indentb">“When we ... when we gave our guarantee and our
support to the Mazzini loan, when we ... when we invoked the Holy Alliance of
peoples against the unholy alliance of their oppressors, we only did, as you
know, what you wished with all your hearts to see done.... The tyrants have
been arraigned before the universal court of mankind in the great trial of
freedom” (and with Arnold as public prosecutor, the “tyrants”
can sleep in peace) ... “arson, murder, pillaging, hunger and bankruptcy
will soon be widespread throughout Germany.</p>
<p class="indentb">“You have the example of France before your eyes
— Smouldering with fury it is more united than ever in its determination
to liberate itself (I ask you, who on earth could have foreseen the 2
December!) — look at Hungary, even the Croats have been converted”
(thanks to the <i>Deutscher Zuschauer</i> and Ruge’s wood-shaving
coats) — “and believe us, for we know, when we say that Poland is
immortal” (Mr. Darasz confided this piece of information to them under
solemn oath of secrecy).</p>
<p class="indentb">“Force against force — that is the justice that
is being prepared. And we shall leave nothing undone to bring into being a
<i>more effective provisional government”</i> (aha!) “than the
Vorparlament <a href="notes.html#n54" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[54]</sup></a> and a
more potent arm of the people than the National Assembly” (see below what
these gentlemen brought into being when they attempted to lead each other by
the nose).</p>
<p class="indentb">“Our draft proposals concerning the finances and the
press” (Articles 1 and 2 of the strong provisional government — the
Customs Officer, Christian Müller, is to be given the task of implementing this
measure) “shall be presented separately. We wish only to say that every
purchase for the Italian Loan will be of immediate benefit to our Committee and
to our cause and that for the moment you can help in a practical way above all
by ensuring a <i>liberal supply of money.</i> We shall then <i>know how to
translate this money into public opinion and public violence.</i> (With Arnold
as translator) ”... We say to you: <i>Subscribe 10 million Francs and we
shall liberate the Continent!</i></p>
<p class="indentb">“Germans, remember...” (that you sing baritone
and light fires on the mountains) "... Lend us your thoughts" (which we need
almost as badly as your money), “your purse” (yes, don't forget
that) “and your arm! We expect your zeal to increase with the intensity
of your sufferings and that the Committee shall be adequately strengthened for
the hour of decision by your present contributions.” (If not, they would
have to resort to spirituous liquor which would be against Gustav's
principles.)</p>
<p class="indentb">“All democrats are <i>instructed</i> to publicise
our appeal” (the Customs Officer, Christian Müller, will take care of the
rest).</p>
<p class="indentb">“London, 13 March 1851</p>
<p class="indentb">The Committee for German Affairs <br>
Arnold Ruge, Gustav Struve, Ernst Haug, Johannes Ronge, Gottfried
Kinkel”</p>
<p class="fst">Our readers are now acquainted with Gottfried, they are also
acquainted with Gustav; Arnold's "frequent appearances" have likewise been
repeated often enough. So there remain but two members of the “effective
provisional government” whom we have still to introduce.</p>
<p>Johannes <i>Ronge</i> or Johannes Kurzweg as he likes to be known in his
intimate circle, is certainly not the author of the Book of
<i>Revelations.</i> There is nothing mysterious about him, he is banal,
hackneyed, as insipid as water, luke-warm dish-water. As is well known Johannes
became famous when he refused to permit the Holy Mantle <a href="notes.html#n55" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[55]</sup></a> in Trier to intercede
for him — though it is wholly unimportant who intercedes for Johannes.
When Johannes first made his appearance the elderly Paulus <a href="notes.html#n56" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[56]</sup></a> expressed his regrets
that Hegel was dead as he would no longer be able to regard <i>him</i> as
shallow were he alive and he added that the late lamented Krug was lucky to be
dead as he thereby escaped the danger of acquiring a reputation for profundity.
Johannes is one of those phenomena often met with in history who only begin to
understand a movement centuries after its rise and fall and who then like
children reproduce the content of the movement as if it had just been
discovered, regurgitating it in the most feeble, colourless and philistinic
manner imaginable. Such craftsmanship does not last very long and soon our
Johannes found himself in a daily deteriorating situation in Germany. His
watered-down version of the Enlightenment went out of fashion and Johannes made
a pilgrimage to England where we see him reappear, without any notable success,
as the rival of Padre Gavazzi. <a href="notes.html#n57" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[57]</sup></a> The ungainly, sallow, tedious village parson
naturally paled by the side of the fiery, histrionic Italian monk and the
English bet heavily that this arid Johannes could not be the man who had set
the deep-thinking German nation in motion. But he was consoled by Arnold Ruge
who found that the German-Catholicism of our Johannes was remarkably similar to
his own brand of atheism.</p>
<p>Ludwig von Hauck had been a captain of engineers in the Imperial Austrian
army, then co-editor of the <i>Constitution</i> in Vienna, later still leader
of a battalion in the Viennese National Guard, where he defended the Burgtor
against the Imperial army on October 30 with great courage, abandoning his post
only after all was lost. He escaped to Hungary, joined up with Bem's army in
Siebenburgen where in consequence of his velour he advanced to the rank of
colonel in the general staff. After Görgy surrendered at Vilagos Ludwig Hauck
was taken prisoner and died like a hero on one of the many gallows that the
Austrians erected in Hungary to avenge their repeated defeats and to express
their fury at the protection Russia had extended and which they so bitterly
resented. In London Haug was long thought to be the incarcerated Hauck, an
officer, who had so distinguished himself in the Hungarian campaign. However,
it now seems to be established that he is not the late Hauck. Just as he was
unable to prevent Mazzini from improvising him into a general after the fall of
Rome, so too he could do nothing to stop Arnold Ruge from transforming him into
the representative of the Viennese revolution and a member of the strong
provisional government. Later he gave aesthetic lectures about the economic
foundations of the cosmogony of universal history from a geological standpoint
and with musical accompaniment. Among the <i>émigrés</i> this melancholic man
is known as "the poor wretch", or as the French say, <i>"la bonne
bête".</i></p>
<p>Arnold could not believe his good fortune. He had a manifesto, a strong
provisional government, a loan of ten million francs and even a homunculus to
produce a weekly magazine with the modest title <i>Kosmos</i>, edited by
General Haug.</p>
<p>The manifesto came and went unread. The <i>Kosmos</i> died of malnutrition
in the third number, the money failed to roll in, the provisional government
dissolved into its components once more.</p>
<p>At first, the <i>Kosmos</i> contained advertisements for Kinkel's
lectures, for the worthy Willich's appeals for money for the Schleswig-Holstein
refugees and for Göhringer's saloon. It contained further a lampoon by Arnold.
The old joker invented a certain hospitable friend called Müller in Germany
whose guest, Schulze, he pretended to be. Müller expresses astonishment at what
he reads in the papers about English hospitality; he fears that all this
“sybaritism” may distract Schulze from his “affairs of
state” — but he does not grudge him this as when Schulze returns to
Germany he will be so overwhelmed by state affairs that he will have to deny
himself the pleasures of Müller's hospitality. Finally, Müller exclaims:
“Surely it was not the traitor Radowitz, but Mazzini, Ledru-Rollin,
Citizen Willich, Kinkel and yourself” (Arnold Ruge) "who were invited to
Windsor Castle?"</p>
<p>If after all this the <i>Kosmos</i> folded up after the third issue the
failure could not be put down to lack of publicity, for at every possible
English meeting the speakers would find it pressed into their hands with the
urgent request to recommend it as they would find their own principles
specially represented in it.</p>
<p>Scarcely had the subscriptions for the ten-million-Franc loan been opened
than the rumour went around that a list of contributors to a fund to dispatch
Struve (and Amalia) to America, was circulating in the City.</p>
<p class="indentb">“When the Committee resolved to publish a German
weekly with Haug as editor, Struve protested as he wanted the post of editor
for himself and wished the journal to bear the title <i>Deutscher
Zuschauer.</i> Having protested he resolved to go to America.”</p>
<p class="fst">Thus far the report in the <i>Deutsche Schnellpost</i> of New
York. It remains silent about the fact (and Heinzen had his reasons for this)
that as Gustav was a collaborator on the Duke of Brunswick’s
<i>Deutscher Londoner Zeitung</i> Mazzini had struck his name off the list of
the German Committee. Gustav soon acclimatised his <i>Deutscher Zuschauer</i>
in New York. But soon after came the news from over the ocean:
“Gustav’s <i>Zuschauer is</i> dead.” As he says, this was
not for the lack of subscribers, nor because he had no leisure for writing but
simply because of a dearth of <i>paying</i> subscribers. However, the
democratic revision of Rotteck's <i>Universal History</i> could not be
postponed any longer, so great was the need for it, and as he had already begun
it 15 years previously he would give the subscribers a corresponding number of
issues of the <i>Universal History</i> instead of the <i>Deutscher
Zuschauer.</i> He would have to request payment in advance for this to which
in the circumstances no one could object. As long as Gustav had remained on
this side of the Atlantic Heinzen regarded him along with Ruge as the greatest
man in Europe. Scarcely had he reached the other side than a great scandal
arose between them.</p>
<p>Gustav writes:</p>
<p class="indentb">“When on 6 June in Karlsruhe Heinzen saw that cannon
was being brought up he left for Strasbourg with female companions.”</p>
<p class="fst">Whereupon Heinzen called Gustav “a soothsayer”.</p>
<p>Arnold was busy broadcasting the virtues of the <i>Kosmos</i> in the
journal of his faithful disciple Heinzen, when it failed to appear, and at
about the time when the strong provisional government was disintegrating
Rodomonte-Heinzen was busy proclaiming “military obedience” towards
it in his journal. Heinzen is famous for his love of the military in
peacetime.</p>
<p class="indentb">“Shortly after Struve's departure <i>Kinkel</i> too
resigned from the Committee which was thereby reduced to impotence.“
<i>(Deutsche Schnellpost</i>, No. 23.)</p>
<p class="fst">With this the strong provisional government dwindled still
further and only Messrs. Ruge, Ronge, and Haug remained in it. Even Arnold
realised that with this Trinity nothing at all could be brought into existence,
let alone a cosmos. Nevertheless through all the permutations, variations and
combinations it remained the nucleus of all his subsequent attempts to form
committees. An indefatigable man, he saw no reason to throw in his hand; after
all his aim was merely to do something that would have the appearance of
action, the semblance of profound political schemes, something that, above all,
would provide matter for self-important consultations, frequent appearances and
complacent gossip.</p>
<p>As for Gottfried, his dramatic lectures for respectable city merchants did
not allow him to compromise himself. But on the other hand, it was altogether
too evident that the purpose of the manifesto of March 13 was none other than
to provide support for the place Arnold had usurped in the European Central
Committee. Even Gottfried could not fail to realise this: but it was not in his
interest to grant Ruge such recognition. So it came to pass that shortly after
the manifesto had been published, the <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i> printed a
declaration by that <i>dama acerba</i>, Mockel. Her husband, she wrote, had
not signed the appeal, he was not interested in public loans and had resigned
from the newly-formed committee. Whereupon Arnold gossiped in the New York
<i>Schnellpost</i> to the effect that Kinkel had been prevented by illness
from signing the manifesto, but he gave his approval, the plan to issue it had
been conceived in his room, he had himself taken responsibility for despatching
a number of copies to Germany and he only left the committee because it elected
General Haug president in preference to himself. Arnold accompanied this
declaration with angry attacks on Kinkel's vanity, calling him “absolute
martyr” and “the Beckerath of the democrats” and affirming
his suspicions of Mrs. Johanna Kinkel who had access to such prohibited
journals as the <i>Kölnische Zeitung.</i></p>
<p>In the meantime, Arnold's seed had not fallen on stony soil. Kinkel's
“beautiful soul” resolved to turn the tables on his rivals and to
raise the treasure of revolution alone. Johanna's statement dissociating him
from this hare-brained scheme had scarcely appeared in the <i>Kölnische
Zeitung</i> when Gottfried launched his own appeal in the transatlantic papers
with the comment that the money should be sent to the man “who inspires
the most confidence”. And who could this man be but Gottfried Kinkel? For
the time being he demanded an advance payment of 500 pounds sterling with which
to manufacture revolutionary paper money. Ruge, not to be outdone, had the
<i>Schnellpost</i> declare that he was the treasurer of the Democratic
Central Committee and that Mazzini notes were already available and could be
purchased from him. Whoever wished to lose 500 pounds sterling would do better
to take the available notes than to speculate in something that did not even
exist. And Rodomonte-Heinzen roared that unless Mr. Kinkel abandoned his
manoeuvres he would be branded publicly as an “enemy of the
revolution”. Gottfried had counter-articles published in the
<i>New-Yorker Staatszeitung</i>, the direct rival of the
<i>Schnellpost.</i> In this way full-scale hostilities were in progress on
the other side of the Atlantic while kisses of Judas were still being exchanged
in this side.</p>
<p>By issuing an appeal for a national loan in his own name Gottfried had
shocked the democratic rank and file, as he soon realised. To make good his
blunder he now declared that “this appeal for money, for a German
national loan did not proceed from him. In all likelihood what had happened was
that some all too zealous friends in America had made free with his
name.”</p>
<p>This declaration provoked the following answer from Dr. Wiss in the
<i>Schnellpost:</i></p>
<p class="indentb">“It is generally known that the appeal to agitate for a
German Loan was sent to me by <i>Gottfried Kinkel with the urgent request</i>
to publicise it in all the German newspapers and I am ready and willing to show
this letter to anyone who is in doubt on this point. If Kinkel has now really
alleged the contrary the only honourable course for him to pursue is to retract
his statements publicly and to publish my correspondence with him from which it
will become plain to the Party that I was quite independent and certainly that
I did not exhibit ‘an excess of zeal’. Should he not have been guilty of these
allegations it was Kinkel's duty to denounce the journalist responsible for
printing them as an evil slanderer, or if there had been a misunderstanding, as
an irresponsible and unscrupulous gossip. For my part I am unable to believe
Kinkel capable of such unmitigated perfidy. Dr. C. Wiss.” (Weekly supplement of
the <i>Deutsche Schnellpost.)</i></p>
<p class="fst">What was Kinkel to do? Once again he thrust his <i>aspra
donzella</i> into the breach, he denounced Mockel as the “irresponsible,
unscrupulous gossip”, he claimed that his wife had promoted the loan behind his
back. It cannot be denied that this tactic was highly “aesthetic”.</p>
<p>Thus did Gottfried sway like a reed, now advancing, now retreating, now
launching a project, now dissociating himself from it, always tacking to adjust
to the wind of popularity. While he officially allowed the aesthetic
bourgeoisie to fete and feast him in London as the martyr of the Revolution
behind the backs of the same people he indulged in forbidden commerce with the
mob of the Emigration as represented by Willich. While living in circumstances
that could be described as luxurious in comparison with his modest situation in
Bonn, he wrote to St. Louis that he was living as befitted the "representative
of poverty". In this way he behaved towards the bourgeoisie as etiquette
required, while at the same time he deferred humbly to the taste of the
proletariat. But as a man whose imagination far outweighed his understanding he
could not help falling into the bad manners and the arrogant postures of the
parvenu and this alienated many a pompous bonhomme from him. Wholly
characteristic of him was the article on the Great Exhibition that he wrote for
<i>Kosmos.</i> He admired nothing so much as the giant mirror that was
exhibited in the Crystal Palace. The objective world reduces itself to a
mirror, the subjective world to a cliché. Under the pretext of seeing only the

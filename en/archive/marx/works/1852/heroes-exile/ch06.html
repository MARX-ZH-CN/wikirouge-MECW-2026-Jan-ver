<h1>Heroes of the Exile</h1>
<a id="6"></a>
<h1>VI</h1>
<p class="fst">Together with Gustav, Rodomonte <span class="context">[the
nickname refers back to the quotation closing the former chapter]</span>
Heinzen had arrived in London from Switzerland. Karl Heinzen had for many years
made a living from his threat to destroy "tyranny" in Germany. After the
outbreak of the February Revolution he went so far as to attempt, with
unheard-of courage, to inspect German soil from the vantage point of Schuster
Island <span class="context">[near Basle]</span>. He then betook himself to
Switzerland where from the safety of Geneva he again thundered against the
“tyrants and oppressors of the people” and took the opportunity to
declare that “Kossuth is a great man, but Kossuth has forgotten about
explosive silver”. His horror of bloodshed was such that it turned him
into the alchemist of the revolution. He dreamt of an explosive substance that
would blast the whole European reaction into the air in a trice without its
users even getting their fingers burnt. He had a particular aversion to walking
amid a shower of bullets and in general to conventional warfare in which
principles are no defence against bullets. Under the government of Brentano he
risked a revolutionary visit to Karlsruhe. As he did not receive the reward he
thought due to him for his heroic deeds he resolved to edit the
<i>Moniteur</i> <a href="notes.html#n38" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[38]</sup></a> of
that "traitor" Brentano. But as the Prussians advanced he declared that Heinzen
would not "let himself be shot" for that traitor Brentano. Under the pretext of
forming an elite corps where political principles and military organisation
would mutually complement each other, i.e. where military cowardice would pass
for political courage, his constant search for the ideal free corps made him
retrace his steps until he had regained the familiar territory of Switzerland.
Sophie's Journey from Memel to Saxony <a href="notes.html#n39" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[39]</sup></a> was a good deal more bloody than Heinzen's
revolutionary expedition. On his arrival in Switzerland he declared that there
were no longer any real men in Germany, that the authentic explosive silver had
not yet been discovered, that the war was not being conducted on revolutionary
principles but in the normal fashion with powder and lead, and that he intended
to revolutionise in Switzerland as Germany was a lost cause. In the secluded
idyll of Switzerland and with the tortured dialect they speak there it was easy
for Rodomonte to pass for a German writer and even for a dangerous man. He
achieved his aim. He was expelled and dispatched to London at Federal expense.
Rodomonte Heinzen had not directly participated in the European revolutions;
but, undeniably, he had moved about extensively on their behalf. When the
February Revolution broke out he took up a collection of “revolutionary
money” in New York, hastened to the aid of his country and advanced as
far as the Swiss border. When the March Club's <a href="notes.html#n40" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[40]</sup></a> revolution collapsed he retired from Switzerland
to beyond the Channel at the expense of the Swiss Federal Council. He had the
satisfaction of making the revolution pay for his advance and the
counter-revolution for his retreat.</p>
<p>At every turn in the Italian epics of chivalry we encounter mighty,
broad-shouldered giants armed with colossal staves who despite the fact that
they lash about them wildly and make a frightening din in battle, never manage
to kill their foes but only to destroy the trees in the vicinity. Mr. Heinzen
is such an Ariostian giant in political literature. Endowed by nature with a
churlish figure and huge masses of flesh he interpreted these gifts to mean
that he was destined to be a great man. His weighty physical appearance
determines his whole literary posture which is physical through and through.
His opponents are always small, mere dwarfs, who can barely reach his ankles
and whom he can survey with his kneecap. When, however, he should indeed make a
physical appearance, our uomo membruto takes refuge in literature or in the
courts. Thus scarcely had he reached the safety of English soil than he wrote a
tract on moral courage. Or again, our giant allowed a certain Mr. Richter to
thrash him so frequently and so thoroughly in New York that the magistrate, who
at first only imposed insignificant fines relented and in recognition of
Heinzen's doggedness he sentenced the dwarf Richter to pay 200 dollars damages.
The natural complement to this great physique so healthy in every fibre is the
<i>healthy commonsense</i> which Heinzen ascribes to himself in the highest
possible degree. It is inevitable that a man with such commonsense will turn
out to be a natural genius who has learnt nothing, a barbarian innocent of
literature and science. By virtue of his commonsense (which he also calls his
"perspicacity" and which allows him to tell Kossuth that he has "advanced to
the extreme frontiers of thought"), he learns only from hearsay or the
newspapers. He is therefore always behind the times and always wears the coat
that literature has cast off some years previously, while rejecting as immoral
and reprehensible the new modern dress he cannot find his way into. But when he
has once assimilated a thing his faith in it is unshakable; it transforms
itself into something that has grown naturally, that is self-evident, that
everyone must immediately agree to and that only malicious, stupid or
sophisticated persons will pretend not to believe. Such a robust body and
healthy commonsense must of course have also some honest, down-to-earth
principles and he even shows to advantage when he takes the craze for
principles to extremes. In this field Heinzen is second to none. He draws
attention to his principles at every opportunity, every argument is met by an
appeal to principle, everyone who fails to understand him or whom he does not
understand is demolished by the argument that he has no real principles, his
insincerity and pure ill-will are such that he would deny that day was day and
night night. To deal with these base disciples of Ahriman <span class="context">[Zoroastrian demon who returns to earth every 1000 years to
wreak havoc]</span> he summons up his muse, indignation; he curses, rages,
boasts, preaches, and foaming at the mouth he roars out the most tragicomical
imprecations. He demonstrates what can be achieved in the field of literary
invective by a man to whom Börne’s <a href="notes.html#n41" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[41]</sup></a> wit and literary talent are equally alien. As the
muse is, so is the style. An eternal bludgeon, but a commonplace bludgeon with
knots that are not even original or sharp. Only when he encounters science does
he feel momentarily at a loss. He is then like that Billingsgate fishwife with
whom O'Connell became involved in a shouting match and whom he silenced by
replying to a long string of insults: "You are all that and worse: you are an
isosceles triangle, you are a parallelepiped".</p>
<p>From the earlier history of Mr. Heinzen mention should be made of the fact
that he was in the Dutch colonies where he advanced not indeed to the rank of
general but to that of NCO, a slight for which he later on always treated the
Dutch as a nation without principles. Later we find him back in Cologne as a
sub-inspector of taxes and in this capacity he wrote a comedy in which his
healthy commonsense vainly strove to satirise the philosophy of Hegel. He was
more at home in the gossip columns of the <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i>, in the
feuilleton where he let fall some weighty words about the quarrels in the
Cologne Carnival Club, the institute from which all the great men of Cologne
have graduated. His own sufferings and those of his father, a forester, in his
conflicts with superiors assumed the proportions of events of universal
significance, as easily happens when the man of healthy commonsense
contemplates his little personal problems. He gives an account of them in his
<i>Prussian Bureaucracy</i>, a book much inferior to Venedey's <a href="notes.html#n42" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[42]</sup></a> and containing nothing
more than the complaints of a petty official against the higher authorities.
The book involved him in a trial and although the worst he had to fear was six
months in gaol he thought his head was in danger and fled to Brussels. From
here he demanded that the Prussian government should not only grant him a safe
conduct but also that they should suspend the whole French legal system and
give him a jury trial for an ordinary offence. The Prussian government issued a
warrant for his arrest; he replied with a “warrant“ against the
Prussian government which contained <i>inter alia</i> a sermon on moral
resistance and constitutional monarchy and condemned revolution as immoral and
jesuitical. From Brussels he went to Switzerland. Here, as we saw above, he met
Friend Arnold and from him he learnt not only his philosophy but also a very
useful method of self-enrichment. Just as Arnold sought to assimilate the ideas
of his opponents in the course of polemicising against them, so Heinzen learned
to acquire ideas new to him by reviling them. Hardly had he become an atheist
than with all the zeal of the proselyte he immediately plunged into a furious
polemic against poor old Follen <span class="context">[August Follen, German
poet who wrote a collection of sonnets aimed against Heinzen and Ruge]
</span>because the latter saw no reason to become an atheist in his old age.
Having had his nose rubbed in the Swiss Federal Republic our healthy
commonsense developed to the point where it desired to introduce the Federal
Republic into Germany too. The same commonsense came to the conclusion that
this could not be done without a revolution and so Heinzen became a
revolutionary. He then began a trade in pamphlets which in the coarsest tones
of the Swiss peasant preached immediate revolution and death to the rulers from
whom all the evils of the world stem. He sought out committees in Germany who
would drum up the cost of printing and distributing these pamphlets and this
led naturally to the growth of a begging industry on a large scale in the
course of which the party workers were first exploited and then reviled. Old
Itzstein could tell a story or two about that. These pamphlets gave Heinzen a
great reputation among itinerant German wine salesmen who praised him
everywhere as a bonny little fighter.</p>
<p>From Switzerland he went to America. Here, although his Swiss rustic style
enabled him to pass as a genuine poet he nevertheless managed to ride the New
York <i>Schnellpost</i> to death in no time at all</p>
<p>Having returned to Europe in the wake of the February revolution he sent
despatches to the <i>Mannheimer Zeitung</i> announcing the arrival of the
great Heinzen and he also published a pamphlet to revenge himself on Lamartine
who together with his whole government had refused to acknowledge him as an
official representative of the American Germans. He still did not wish to go to
Prussia as he still feared for his head despite the March Revolution and the
general amnesty. He would wait until the nation summoned him. As this did not
happen he resolved to stand in absentia for the Hamburg constituency to the
Frankfurt Parliament: his hope was that he would compensate for being a bad
speaker by the loudness of his voice — but he lost the election.</p>
<p>Arriving in London after the collapse of the Baden uprising he fell into a
rage with the young people who knew nothing of this great man of
<i>before</i> the revolution and of <i>after</i> the revolution, and who
caused him to sink into oblivion. He had always been nothing more than
<i>l'homme de la veille</i> or <i>l'homme du lendemain</i>, he was never
<i>l'homme du jour</i> or even <i>de la journée.</i> As the authentic
exploding silver had still not been discovered new weapons had to be found to
combat the reaction. He called for two million heads so that he could be a
dictator and wade up to the ankles in blood — shed by others. His real
aim was, of course, to create a scandal; the reaction had brought him to London
at its own expense, by means of an expulsion order from England it would now,
so Heinzen hoped, expedite him gratis to New York. The coup failed and its only
consequence was that the radical French papers called him a fool who shouted
for two million heads only because he had never risked his own. To complete the
picture it should be pointed out that his bloodthirsty article had been
published in the <i>Deutsche Londoner Zeitung</i> owned by the ex-Duke of
Brunswick — in return for a cash payment, of course.</p>
<p>Gustav and Heinzen had admired each other for a considerable time. Heinzen
praised Gustav as a sage and Gustav praised Heinzen as a fighter. Heinzen had
scarcely been able to wait for the end of the European revolution so that he
could put an end to the “ruinous disunity in the democratic German
<i>emigration”</i> and to re-open his pre-revolutionary business. He
called for discussion of a draft programme of the German Revolutionary Party.
This programme was distinguished by the invention of a special ministry
“to cater for the all-important need for public playgrounds,
battlegrounds” (minus hail of bullets) “and gardens”, and was
notable also for the article abolishing “the privileges of the male sex
especially in marriage” (and also in thrusting maneuvers [Stosstaktik] in
war, see Clausewitz). This programme was actually no more than a diplomatic
note from Heinzen to Gustav as no-one else was clamouring for it. And instead
of the hoped for unification it brought about the immediate separation of the
two warriors. Heinzen had demanded that during the “revolutionary
transition period” there should be a single dictator who would moreover
be a Prussian and, to preclude all misunderstandings, he added: “No
soldier can qualify as dictator.“ Gustav, on the other hand, argued for a
triumvirate comprising two Badeners and himself. Moreover, Gustav found that
Heinzen had included in his prematurely published programme an
“idea” stolen from him. This put an end to the second attempt at
unification and Heinzen, denied recognition by the whole world, receded into
obscurity until, in Autumn 1850, he found English soil too hot for him and
sailed off to New York.</p>
<a id="7"></a>
<h3>VII<br>
Gustav and the Colony of Renunciation</h3>
<p class="fst">After the indefatigable Gustav had made an unsuccessful attempt
to establish a <i>Central Refugee Committee</i> together with Friedrich
Bobzin, Habegg, Oswald, Rosenblum, Cohaheim, Grunich and other "outstanding"
men, he made his way towards Yorkshire. For here, so he believed, a magic
garden would flower and in it, unlike the garden of Alcine, <a href="notes.html#n43" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[43]</sup></a> virtue would rule
instead of vice. An old Englishman with a sense of humour who had been bored by
Gustav's theories took him at his word and gave him a few acres of moor in
Yorkshire on the express condition that he would there found a “colony of
renunciation”, a colony in which the consumption of meat, tobacco and
spirits would be strictly prohibited, only a vegetarian diet would be permitted
and where every colonist would be obliged to read a chapter from Struve's book
on Constitutional Law at his morning prayers. Moreover, the colony was to be
self-supporting. Accompanied by his Amalia, by Schnauffer, his Swabian canary
and by a few other good men and true, Gustav placed his trust in God and went
to found the “Colony of Renunciation”. Of the colony it must be
reported that it contained little prosperity, much culture and unlimited
freedom to be bored and to grow thin. One fine morning Gustav uncovered a
dreadful plot. His companions who did not share Gustav's ruminant constitution
had resolved behind his back to slaughter the old cow, the only one and one
whose milk provided the chief source of income of the “Colony of
Renunciation”. Gustav wrung his hands and shed bitter tears at this
betrayal of a fellow creature. He indignantly dissolved the colony and decided
to become a "wet" Quaker <a href="notes.html#n44" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[44]</sup></a> if he were unable to revive the <i>Deutscher
Zuschauer</i> or to establish a “provisional government” in
London.</p>
<a id="8"></a>
<h1>VIII</h1>
<p class="fst">Arnold, who was anything but content in his retreat in Ostend
and who longed for a “frequent appearance” before the public, heard
of Gustav's misfortune. He resolved to return to England at once and by
climbing on Gustav's shoulders, to hoist himself into the pentarchy of European
democracy. For in the meantime the European Central Committee <a href="notes.html#n45" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[45]</sup></a> had been formed
consisting of Mazzini, Ledru-Rollin and Darasz. Mazzini of course was the soul
of the enterprise. Ruge thought he could smell a vacant position. In his
<i>Proscrit</i> Mazzini had indeed introduced General Ernst Haug, his own
invention, as the German associate but for decency’s sake it was not
possible to nominate such a completely unknown person onto the Central
Committee. Ruge was not unaware of the fact that Gustav had had dealings with
Mazzini in Switzerland. He himself was acquainted with Ledru-Rollin but
unfortunately Ledru-Rollin was not acquainted with him. So Arnold took up
residence in Brighton and flattered and cajoled the unsuspecting Gustav,
promised to help him found a <i>Deutscher Zuschauer</i> in London and even to
undertake as a joint venture the democratic publication of the Rotteck-Welcker
<i>Lexicon of Politics</i> with Ruge paying the costs. At the same time he
introduced Gustav as a great man and collaborator into the local German paper
which in accordance with his principles he always had on tap (this time the
blow fell on the <i>Bremer Tages-Chronik</i> of the nonconformist parson
Dulon). One good deed deserves another: Gustav presented Arnold to Mazzini. As
Arnold's French was wholly incomprehensible there was nothing to prevent him
from introducing himself to Mazzini as the greatest man in Germany and above
all as her greatest “thinker”. The canny Italian idealist at once
realised that Arnold was the man he was looking for, the <i>homme sans
conséquence</i> who would provide the German countersignature of his
anti-papal Bulls. Thus Arnold Ruge became the fifth wheel on the state coach of
European democracy. When an Alsatian asked Ledru what on earth possessed him to
make an ally of such a <i>bête</i>, Ledru replied brusquely: “He is
Mazzini's man.” When Mazzini was asked why he became involved with Ledru,
a man bereft of all ideas, he answered slyly: “I took him for that very
reason.” Mazzini himself had every reason to avoid people with ideas. But
Arnold Ruge saw his wildest dreams come true and for the moment he even forgot
Bruno Bauer.</p>
<p>When the time came for him to sign Mazzini's first manifesto he sadly
recalled the days when he had presented himself to Professor Leo in Halle and
old Follen in Switzerland as a Trinitarian on one occasion and as a humanist
atheist on another. This time he had to declare himself for God and against the
princes. However, Arnold's philosophic conscience had been enfeebled by his
association with Dulon and other parsons among whom he passed for a
philosopher. Even in his best days Arnold could not entirely suppress a certain
foible for religion in general and moreover his “honest
consciousness” kept on whispering to him: Sign, Arnold! Paris vaut bien
une messe. One does not become fifth wheel on the coach of the provisional
govemment of Europe in partibus for nothing. Reflect, Arnold! all you have to
do is sign a manifesto every two weeks, and as a member of the German
Parliament, in the company of the greatest men in all Europe. And bathed in
perspiration Arnold signs. A curious joke, he murmurs. Ce n'est que le premier
pas qui coûte. He had copied this last sentence into his notebook the previous
night. However, Arnold had not come to the end of his trials. The European
Central Committee had issued a series of manifestos to Europe, to the French,
the Italians, the Poles and the Wallachians and now, following the great battle
at Bronzell, <a href="notes.html#n46" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[46]</sup></a> it was
<i>Germany’s</i> turn. In his draft Mazzini attacked the Germans for
their lack of cosmopolitan spirit, and in particular, for their arrogant
treatment of Italian salami vendors, organ-grinders, confectioners, dormouse
tamers and mouse-trap sellers. Taken aback Arnold confessed that it was true.
He went further. He declared his readiness to cede the Austrian Tirol and
Istria to Mazzini. But this was not enough. He had not only to appeal to the
conscience of the German people, but also to attack them where they were most
vulnerable. Arnold received instructions that this time he was to have an
opinion, as he represented the German element. He felt like the student Jobs.
<a href="notes.html#n47" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[47]</sup></a> He scratched himself
thoughtfully behind his ear and after long reflection he stuttered:
“Since the age of Tacitus the voices of German bards and baritones can be
heard. In winter they kindle fires on all the mountains so as to warm their
feet.” The bards, the baritones and fires on all the mountains! That will
put a bomb under German freedom! thought Mazzini with a grin. The bards,
baritones, fires on all the mountains and German freedom to boot went into the
manifesto as a sop for the German nation. To his astonishment Arnold had passed
the examination and understood for the first time with what little wisdom the
world is governed. From that moment on he despised Bruno Bauer more than ever
for all his eighteen hefty tomes written while he was still young.</p>
<p>While Arnold in the wake of the European Central Committee was signing
<i>warlike</i> manifestoes with God, for Mazzini and against the princes, the
<i>peace movement</i> was raging not only in England, under the aegis of
Cobden, but even beyond the North Sea. So that in Frankfurt/Main the Yankee
swindler, Elihu Burritt together with Cobden, Jaup, Girardin and the Red Indian
Ka-gi-ga-gi-wa-wa-be-ta organised a Peace Congress. Our Arnold was just itching
to be able to make one of his “frequent appearances” and to give
birth to a manifesto. So he proclaimed himself the corresponding member of the
Frankfurt Assembly and sent over an extremely confused Peace Manifesto
translated out of Cobden's speeches into his own speculative Pomeranian.
Various Germans drew Arnold's attention to the contradiction between his
warlike attitude in the Central Committee and his peaceful Quakerism. He would
reply: “Well, there you have the contradictions. That's the dialectic for
you. In my youth I studied Hegel.” His “honest consciousness”
was eased by the thought that Mazzini knew no German and that it was not hard
to pull the wool over his eyes.</p>
<p>Moreover, his relationship with Mazzini promised to become even more secure
thanks to the protection of <i>Harro Harring</i> who had just landed in Hull.
For with Harring a new and highly symptomatic character steps onto the
stage.</p>
<a id="9"></a>
<h1>IX</h1>
<p class="fst">The great drama of the democratic emigration of 1848-52 had been
preceded by a prelude eighteen years previously: the democratic emigration of
1830-31. Even though with the passage of time most of the players had
disappeared from the stage there still remained a few noble ruins who,
stoically indifferent to the course of history and their own lack of success,
continued their activities as agitators, devised comprehensive plans, formed
provisional governments and hurled proclamations into the world in every
direction. It is obvious that these experienced swindlers were infinitely
superior to the younger generation in business know-how. It was this very
know-how acquired through eighteen years practice in conspiring, scheming,
intriguing, proclaiming, duping, showing off and pushing oneself to the fore
that gave Mr. Mazzini the cheek and the assurance to install himself as the
Central Committee of European democracy supported only by three straw men of
much smaller experience in such matters.</p>
<p>No one was more favoured by circumstances to become the very type of the
<i>émigré</i> agitator than our friend <i>Harro Harring.</i> And indeed he
did become the prototype whom all our heroes of the Exile, all the Arnolds,
Gustavs and Gottfrieds strove more or less consciously and with varying success
to emulate. They may even equal him if circumstances are not unfavourable, but
they will hardly surpass him.</p>
<p>Harro who like Caesar has himself described his own great deeds (London
1852) was born on the “Cimbrian peninsula” and belongs to that
visionary North Frisian race which has already been shown by Dr. Clement to
have produced all the great nations of the world.</p>
<p>“Already in early youth” he attempted to “set the seal of
action upon his enthusiasm for the cause of the peoples“ by going to
<i>Greece</i> in 1821. We see how Friend Harro had an early premonition of
his mission to be everywhere where confusion reigned. Later on “a strange
fate led him to the source of absolutism, to the vicinity of the Czar and he
had seen through the Jesuitism of constitutional monarchy in
<i>Poland“.</i></p>
<p>So Harro fought for freedom in Poland also. But “the crisis in the
history of Europe following the fall of Warsaw greatly perplexed him”,
and his perplexity led him to the idea of “the democracy of
nations”, which he at once “documented in the work: <i>The
Nations</i>, Strasbourg, March 1832”. It is worth remarking that this
work was almost quoted at the Hambacher Fest. <a href="notes.html#n48" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[48]</sup></a> At the same time he published his
“republican poems: <i>Blutstropfen</i> [Drops of Blood]; <i>The
History of King Saul or the Monarchy; Male voices on Germany's
Freedom”</i> and edited the journal <i>Deutschland</i> in Strasbourg.
All these and even his future writings had the unexpected good fortune to be
banned by the Federal Diet on November 4, 1831. This was the only thing he
still lacked, only now did he achieve real importance and also the martyr's
crown. So that he could exclaim “My writings were everywhere well
received and echoed loudly in the hearts of the people. They were mostly
distributed gratis. In the case of some of them I did not even receive enough
to cover the Costs of printing.”</p>
<p>But new honours still awaited him. In 1831 Mr. Welcker had vainly attempted
in a long letter “to convert him to the <i>vertical horizon</i> of
constitutional monarchy”. And now, in January 1832, there came a visit
from Mr. Malten, a well-known Prussian agent abroad, who proposed that he
should enter Prussian service. What double recognition this was — and
from the enemy too! Enough, Malten's offer “triggered off the idea that
in the face of this dynastic treachery he should give birth to the concept of
Scandinavian nationality”, and “from that time on at least the
<i>word</i> Scandinavia was reborn after having been forgotten for
centuries”.</p>
<p>In this manner our North Frisian from South Jutland who did not know himself
whether he was a German or a Dane acquired at least an imaginary nationality
whose first consequence was that the men of Hambach would have nothing to do
with him.</p>
<p>With all these events behind him Harro's fortune was made. Veteran of
freedom in Greece and Poland, the inventor of “democracy of
nations”, re-discoverer of the word “Scandinavia”, poet
acknowledged by the ban of the Federal Diet, thinker and journalist, martyr, a
great man esteemed even by his enemies, a man whose allegiance
constitutionalists, absolutists and republicans vied with each other to possess
and, with all that, empty-headed and confused enough to believe in his own
greatness — what then was needed to make his happiness complete? But
Harro was a conscientious man and as his fame grew so did the demands which he
made upon himself What was missing was a great work that would present in an
entertaining and popular form the great doctrines of freedom, the idea of
democracy, and of nationality and all the sublime struggles for freedom on the
part of the youthful Europe arising before his very eyes. None but a poet and
thinker of the very first rank could produce such a work and none but Harro
could be this man. Thus arose the first three plays of the “dramatic
cycle” <i>The People</i>, of which there were twelve parts in all, one
of them in Danish, a labour to which the author devoted ten years of his life.
Unfortunately eleven of these twelve parts have “hitherto remained in
manuscript”.</p>
<p>However, this dallying with the muse was not to last forever.</p>
<p class="indentb">“In the winter of 1832-1833 a movement was prepared in
Germany — which was brought to a tragic end in the skirmish in Frankfurt.
I was entrusted with the task of taking the fortress (?) in Kehl on the night
of 6 April. Men and weapons were at the ready.“</p>
<p>Unfortunately it all came to nothing and Harro had to retire to the depths
of France where he wrote his <i>Words of a Man.</i> From there he was
summoned to Switzerland by the Poles arming themselves for their march on
Savoy. Here he became “attached to their General Staff”, wrote a
further two parts of his dramatic cycle <i>The People</i>, and made the
acquaintance of Mazzini in Geneva. The whole band of fire-eaters consisting of
Polish, French, German, Italian and Swiss adventurers under the command of the
noble Ramorino then made their famous attack on Savoy. <a href="notes.html#n49" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[49]</sup></a> In this campaign our
Harro "discovered the value of his life and strength". But as the other freedom
fighters felt “the value of their lives” no less than Harro and no
doubt had just as few illusions about their “strength&amp;lrquo; the
exploit ended badly and they returned to Switzerland beaten, dishevelled and in
disarray.</p>
<p>This campaign was all that was needed to give our band of emigrant knights a
complete insight into the terror they inspired in the tyrants. As long as the
aftermath of the July Revolution could still be felt in isolated insurrections
in France, Germany or Italy, as long as they felt someone or other standing
behind them our <i>émigré</i> heroes felt themselves to be but atoms in the
seething masses — more or less privileged, prominent atoms, to be sure,
but in the last analysis they were still atoms. But as these insurrections
gradually grew feebler, as the great mass of “lackeys”, of the
“half-hearted” and the “men of little faith” retired
from the putschist swindles and as our knights felt increasingly lonely, so did
their self-esteem grow in proportion. If the whole of Europe became craven,
stupid and selfish, how could our trusty heroes fail to grow in their own
estimation, for were they not the priests who kept the sacred fires of hatred
for all tyrants burning in their breasts and who maintained the traditions of
virtue and love of freedom for a more vigorous generation yet to come! If they
too deserted the flag the tyrants would be safe for ever. So like the democrats
of 1848 they saw in every defeat a guarantee of future victory and they
gradually transformed themselves more and more into itinerant Don Quixotes with
dubious sources of income. Once arrived at this point they could plan their
greatest act of heroism, the foundation of “Young Europe” whose
Charter of Brotherhood was drawn up by Mazzini and signed in Berne on 15 April
1834. Harro appears in it as</p>
<p class="indentb">“initiator of the Central Committee, adoptive member
of Young Germany and Young Italy and also as representative of the Scandinavian
branch” which he “still represents today”.</p>
<p class="fst">The date of the Charter of Brotherhood marks for Harro the great
epoch from which calculations are made forwards and backwards, thus replacing
the birth of Christ. It is the highpoint of his life. He was co-dictator of
Europe in partibus and although the world knew nothing of him he was one of the
most dangerous men alive. No one stood behind him but his many unpublished
works, a few German artisans in Switzerland and a dozen political speculators
who had seen better days — but for that very reason he could claim that
all the people of the world were on his side. For it is the fate of all great
men not to be recognised by their own age whereas the future belongs to them.
And Harro had taken care of the future — he had it in black and white in
his bag in the form of the Charter of Brotherhood.</p>
<p>But now began Harro's decline. His first sorrow was that “Young
Germany split off from Young Europe in 1836”. But Germany was duly
punished for that. Because of the split <i>“nothing had been
prepared</i> for a national movement in Germany early in 1848” and this
is why everything ended so miserably.</p>
<p>But a much greater sorrow for Harro was the growth of communism. We learn
from him that the founder of communism was none other than</p>
<p class="indentb">“the cynic Johannes Müller from Berlin, the author of
a very interesting pamphlet on Prussian policy, Altenburg 1831”. Müller
went to England where “the only available opening for him was in
Smithfield Market where he had to tend swine at the crack of dawn”.</p>
<p class="fst">Communism soon began to spread among the German artisans in
France and Switzerland and it became a very dangerous enemy for Harro as it cut
off the only market for his writings. This was due to the “indirect
censorship of communism” from which poor Harro has suffered to this very
day and indeed it is now worse than ever as he sadly confesses and “as
the fate of my drama <i>The Dynasty</i> proves”. This indirect
communist censorship even succeeded in expelling Harro from Europe and so he
went to Rio de Janeiro (in 1840) where he lived for a time as a painter.
“Using his time conscientiously here as everywhere” he brought out
a new work: <i>"Poems of a Scandinavian</i> (2000 copies) which has been
distributed so widely among sea-faring people as to have become an oceanic
best-seller".</p>
<p>However, his “scrupulous sense of obligation towards Young
Europe” unfortunately led him to return to the Old World.</p>
<p>He “hastened to Mazzini in London and soon perceived the danger that
threatened the cause of the peoples from communism”.</p>
<p>New deeds awaited him. The Bandiera brothers <a href="notes.html#n50" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[50]</sup></a> were preparing for their expedition to Italy. To
support them and to divert the forces of despotism Harro “returned to
South America where in union with Garibaldi he dedicated himself to furthering
the idea of a United States of South America”.</p>
<p>But the despots had got wind of his mission and Harro took to his heels. He
sailed to New York.</p>
<p class="indentb">“During the voyage I was very active intellectually
and wrote among other things a drama: <i>The Power of Ideas</i>, which
belonged to the dramatic cycle <i>The People —</i> this too has
remained in MS. up to now!”</p>
<p class="fst">From South America he brought with him to New York a programme
from a group alleged to be affiliated with <i>Humanidad.</i></p>
<p>The news of the February Revolution inspired him to produce a pamphlet in
French, <i>La France réveillée</i> and while embarking for Europe “I
documented my love for my country once again in some poems,
<i>Scandinavia”.</i></p>
<p>He went to Schleswig-Holstein. Here, after an absence of twentyseven years,
he “discovered an unheard of conceptual confusion in the sphere of
international law, democracy, republicanism socialism and communism, a chaos
which lay like rotting hay and straw in the Augean stables of party factions
and national hatred”.</p>
<p>No wonder, for his “political writings” like his “whole
striving and activities since 1831 had remained alien and unknown in those
frontier provinces of my home country”.</p>
<p>The Augustenburg Party <a href="notes.html#n51" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[51]</sup></a> had suppressed him for eighteen years by means of
a conspiracy of silence. To deal with this he girt on a sabre, a rifle, four
pistols and six daggers and called for the formation of a free corps, but in
vain. After various adventures he finally arrived in Hull. Here he hastened to
issue two circulars to the peoples of Schleswig-Holstein, Scandinavia and
Germany and even sent a note, as has been reported, to two communists in London
with this message: "Five thousand workers in Norway send you fraternal
greetings through me.</p>
<p>Despite this curious appeal he soon became a sleeping partner of the
European Central Committee again, thanks to the Charter of Brotherhood, and he
also became “nightwatchman and employee of a young firm of brokers in
Gravesend on the Thames where my task was to drum up trade among ships’
captains in nine different languages until I was accused of fraud, a thing
which the philosopher Johannes Müller was at least spared in his capacity as
swineherd”.</p>
<p>Harro summarised his action-packed life as follows:</p>
<p class="indentb">“It can easily be calculated that apart from my poems
I have given away more than 18,000 copies of my writings in German (varying
from 10 shillings to 3 Marks in price, and hence amounting to around 25,000
Marks in toto) to the democratic movement. I have never even been reimbursed
for the printing costs, let alone received any profit for myself.”</p>
<p class="fst">With this we bring the adventures of our demagogic Hidalgo from
the South Jutland Mancha to a close. In Greece and Brazil, on the Vistula and
La Plata, in Schleswig-Holstein and in New York, in London and in Switzerland:
the representative of Young Europe and of the South American
<i>Humanidad</i>, painter, nightwatchman and employee, peddler of his own
writings; among Poles one day and gauchos the next, and ship’s captains the day
after that; unacknowledged, abandoned, ignored but everywhere an itinerant
knight of freedom with a thoroughgoing dislike of ordinary bourgeois hard work
— our hero at all times in all countries and in all circumstances remains
himself; with the same confusion, the same meddlesome pretensions, the same
faith in himself He will always defy the world and never cease to say, write
and print that since 1831 he has been the mainspring of world history.</p>

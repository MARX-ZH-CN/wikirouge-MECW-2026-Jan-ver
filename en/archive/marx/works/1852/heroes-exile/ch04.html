<h1>IV</h1>
<p class="fst">We next meet Kinkel again in London, and this time, thanks to
his prison fame and the sentimentality of the German Philistines, he has become
the greatest man in Germany. Mindful of his sublime mission Friend Gottfried
was able <i>to</i> exploit all the advantages of the moment. His romantic
escape gave new impetus to the Kinkel cult in Germany and he adroitly directed
this onto a path that was not without beneficial material consequences. At the
same time London provided the much venerated man with a new, complex arena in
which to receive even greater acclaim. He did not hesitate: he would have to be
the new lion of the season. With this in mind he refrained for the time being
from all political activity and withdrew into the seclusion of his home in
order to grow a beard, without which no prophet can succeed. After that he
visited Dickens, the English liberal newspapers, the German businessmen in the
City and especially the aesthetic Jews in that place. He was all things to all
men: to one a poet, to another a patriot in general, professor of fine arts to
a third, Christ to the fourth, the patiently suffering Odysseus to the fifth.
To everyone, however, he appeared as the gentle, artistic, benevolent and
humanitarian Gottfried. He did not rest until Dickens had eulogised him in the
<i>Household Words</i>, until the <i>Illustrated News</i> had published his
portrait. He induced the few Germans in London who had been involved in the
Kinkel mania even at a distance to allow themselves to be invited to lectures
on modern drama. Once he had organised them in this way tickets to these
lectures flooded into the homes of the local German population. No running
around, no advertisement, no charlatanism, no importunity was beneath him; in
return, however, he did not go unrewarded. Gottfried sunned himself
complacently in the mirror of his own fame and in the gigantic mirror of the
Crystal Palace of the world. And we may say that he now felt tremendously
content.</p>
<p>There was no lack of praise for his lectures (see <i>Kosmos).</i></p>
<h4><i>Kosmos:</i> "Kinkel's Lectures"</h4>
<p class="indentb">"While looking once at Dobler's paintings of misty
landscapes, I was surprised by the whimsical question of whether it was
possible to produce such chaotic creations in words, whether it was possible to
utter misty images. It is no doubt unpleasant for the critic to have to confess
that in this case his critical autonomy will vibrate against the galvanized
nerves of an external reminiscence, as the fading sound of a dying note echoes
in the strings. Nevertheless I would prefer to renounce any attempt at a
bewigged and boring analysis of pedantic insensitivity than to deny that tone
which the charming muse of the German refugee caused to resonate in my
<i>sensibility.</i> This ground note of Kinkel's paintings, this sounding
board of his chords is the sonorous, creative, formative and gradually shaping
'word' — 'modern thought'. To 'judge' this thought is to lead truth out
of the chaos of mendacious traditions, to constitute it as the indestructible
property of the world and as such to place it under the protection of
spiritually active, logical minorities who will educate the world leading it
from a credulous ignorance to a state of more sceptical science. It is the task
of the science of doubt to profane the mysticism of pious deceit, to undermine
the absolutism of an atrophied tradition. Science must employ scepticism, that
ceaselessly labouring guillotine of philosophy, to decapitate accepted
authority and to lead the nations out of the misty regions of theocracy by
means of revolution into the luscious meadows of democracy" (of nonsense). "The
sustained, unflagging search in the annals of mankind and the understanding of
man himself is the great task of all revolutionaries and this had been
understood by that proscribed poet rebel who on three recent Monday evenings
uttered his subversive views before a bourgeois audience in the course of his
lectures on the history of the modern theatre."</p>
<p>"A Worker"</p>
<p class="fst">It is generally claimed that this worker is a very close
relation of Kinkel's — namely Mockel — as indeed seems likely from
the use of such expressions as "sounding-board", "fading sound", "chords" and
"galvanized nerves".</p>
<p>However, even this period of hard-earned pleasure was not to last forever.
The Last Judgement on the existing world-order, the democratic day of
judgement, namely the much celebrated May 1852 <a href="notes.html#n28" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[28]</sup></a> was drawing ever closer. In order to confront this
day all booted and spurred Kinkel had to don his political lionskin once more:
he had to make contact with the "Emigration".</p>
<p>So we come to the London "Emigration", this hotchpotch of former members of
the Frankfurt Parliament, the Berlin National Assembly, and Chamber of
Deputies, of gentlemen from the Baden Campagne, Gargantuas from the Comedy of
the Imperial Constitution, <a href="notes.html#n29" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[29]</sup></a> writers without a public, loudmouths from the
democratic clubs and congresses, twelfth-rate journalists and so forth.</p>
<p>The heroes of the 1848 revolution in Germany had been on the point of coming
to a sticky end when the victory of ''tyranny'' rescued them, swept them out of
the country and made saints and martyrs of them. They were saved by the
counter-revolution. The course of continental politics brought most of them to
London which thus became their European centre. It is evident that something
had to happen, something had to be arranged to remind the public daily of the
existence of these world-liberators. At all costs it must not become obvious
that the course of universal history might be able to proceed without the
intervention of these mighty men. The more this refuse of mankind found itself
hindered by its own impotence as much as by the prevailing situation from
undertaking any real action, the more zealously did it indulge in spurious
activity whose imagined deeds, imagined parties, imagined struggles and
imagined interests have been so noisily trumpeted abroad by those involved. The
less able they were to bring about a new revolution the more they discounted
the importance of such an eventuality in their minds, while they concentrated
on sharing out the plum jobs and enjoying the prospect of future power. The
form taken by this self-important activity was that of a mutual insurance club
of the heroes-to-be and the reciprocal guarantee of government posts.</p>
<a id="5"></a>
<h1>V</h1>
<p class="fst">The first attempt to create such an "organisation" took place as
early as the Spring of 1850. A magniloquent "draft circular to German
democrats" was hawked around London in manuscript form together with a
“Covering Letter to the Leaders”. It contained an exhortation to
found a united democratic church. Its immediate aim was to form a Central
Office to deal with the affairs of German <i>émigrés</i>, to set up a central
administration for refugee problems, to start a printing press in London, and
to unite all patriots against the common enemy. The Emigration would then
become the centre of the internal revolutionary movement, the organisation of
the Emigration would be the beginning of a comprehensive democratic
organisation, the outstanding personalities among the members of the Central
Office would be paid salaries raised by taxes levied on the German people. This
tax proposal seemed all the more appropriate as “the German Emigration
had gone abroad not merely without a respectable hero but what is even worse,
without common <i>assets”.</i> It is no secret that the Hungarian,
Polish and French committees already in existence provided the model for this
“organisation” and the whole document is redolent of envy of the
privileged position of these prominent allies.</p>
<p>The circular was the joint production of Messrs. Rudolph <i>Schramm</i>
and Gustav <i>Struve</i>, behind whom lay concealed the merry figure of Mr.
Arnold <i>Ruge</i>, a corresponding member living in Ostend at the time.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Rudolph Schramm —</i> a rowdy, loudmouthed and extremely
confused little mannikin whose life-motto came from <i>Rameau's Nephew:</i>
“I would rather be an impudent windbag than be nothing at all.”</p>
<p>When at the height of his power, Mr. Camphausen <a href="notes.html#n30" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[30]</sup></a> would gladly have given the young forward
Crefelder an important post, had it been permissible to elevate a junior
official. Thanks to bureaucratic etiquette Mr. Schrarnm found only the career
of a democrat open to him. And in this profession he really did advance at one
point to the post of President of the Democratic Club in Berlin and with the
support of some left-wing Members of Parliament he became the Deputy for
Striegau in the Berlin National Assembly. Here the normally so loquacious
Schramm distinguished himself by his obstinate silence, which was accompanied,
however, by an uninterrupted series of grunts. After the Assembly had been
dissolved <a href="notes.html#n31" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[31]</sup></a> our
democratic man of the people wrote a pamphlet in support of a constitutional
monarchy but this did not suffice to get him re-elected. Later, at the time of
the Brentano government he appeared momentarily in Baden and there in the
“Club for Resolute Progress” he became acquainted with Struve. On
his arrival in London he declared his intention of withdrawing from all
political activity for which reason he then published the circular referred to
above. Essentially a bureaucrat Mr. Schramm imagined that his family relations
qualified him to represent the radical bourgeoisie in exile and he did indeed
present a fair caricature of the radical bourgeois.</p>
<p><i>Gustav Struve is</i> one of the more important figures of the
emigration. At the very first glimpse of his leathery appearance, his
protuberant eyes with their sly, stupid expression, the matt gleam on his bald
pate and his half Slav, half Kalmuck <span class="context">[a western mongol
people]</span> features one cannot doubt that one is in the presence of an
unusual man. And this first impression is confirmed by his low, guttural voice,
his oily manner of speaking and the air of solemn gravity he imparts to his
gestures. To be just it must be said that faced with the greatly increased
difficulties of distinguishing oneself these days, our Gustav at least made the
effort to attract attention by using his diverse talents — he is part
prophet, part speculator, part bunion healer — centring his activities on
all kinds of peripheral matters and making propaganda for the strangest
assortment of causes. For example, he was born a Russian but suddenly took it
into his head to enthuse about the cause of German freedom after he had been
employed in a minor capacity in the Russian embassy to the Federal Diet and had
written a little pamphlet in defence of the Diet. Regarding his own skull as
normal he suddenly developed an interest in phrenology and from then on he
refused to trust anyone whose skull he had not yet felt and examined. He also
gave up eating meat and preached the gospel of strict vegetarianism; he was,
moreover, a weather-prophet, he inveighed against tobacco and was prominent in
the interest of German Catholicism and water-cures. In harmony with his
thoroughgoing hatred of scientific knowledge it was natural that he should be
in favour of free universities in which the four faculties would be replaced by
the study of phrenology, physiognomy, chiromancy and necromancy. It was also
quite in character for him to insist that he must become a great writer simply
because his mode of writing was the antithesis of everything that could be held
to be stylistically acceptable.</p>
<p>In the early Forties Gustav had already invented the <i>Deutscher
Zuschauer</i>, a little paper that he published in Mannheim, that he patented
and that pursued him everywhere as an <i>idée fixe.</i> He also made the
discovery at around this time that Rotteck's <i>History of the World</i> and
the Rotteck-Welcker <i>Lexicon of Politics</i>, the <i>two</i> works that
had been his Old and New Testaments, were out of date and in need of a new
<i>democratic</i> edition. This revision Gustav undertook without delay and
published an extract from it in advance under the title <i>The Basic Elements
of Political Science.</i> He argued that the revision had become "an
undeniable necessity since 1848 as the late-lamented Rotteck had not
experienced the events of recent years".</p>
<p>In the meantime there broke out in Baden in quick succession the three
"popular uprisings" that Gustav has placed in the very centre of the whole
modern course of world history. Driven into exile by the very first of these
revolts (Hacker's) and occupied with the task of publishing the <i>Deutscher
Zuschauer</i> once again, this time from Basel, he was then dealt a hard blow
by fate when the Mannheim publisher continued <i>to</i> print the
<i>Deutscher Zuschauer</i> under a different editor. The battle between the
true and the false <i>Deutscher Zuschauer</i> was so bitterly fought that
neither paper survived. To compensate for this Gustav devised a constitution
for the German Federal Republic in which Germany was to be divided into 24
republics, each with a president and two chambers; he appended a neat map on
which the whole proposal could be clearly seen. In September 1848 the second
insurrection began in which our Gustav acted as both Caesar and Socrates. He
used the time granted him on German soil to issue serious warnings to the Black
Forest Peasantry about the deleterious effects of smoking tobacco. In Lörrach
he published his Moniteur with the title of <i>Government Organ — German
Free State — Freedom, Prosperity, Education.</i> This publication
contained <i>inter alia</i> the following decree:</p>
<p class="indentb">"Article 1. The extra tax of 10 per cent on goods imported
from Switzerland is hereby abolished;</p>
<p class="indentb">Article 2. <i>Christian Müller, the Customs Officer is to
be given the task of implementing this measure."</i></p>
<p class="fst">He was accompanied in all his trials by his faithful Amalia who
subsequently published a romantic account of them. She was also active in
administering the oath to captured gendarmes, for it was her custom to fasten a
red band around the arm of every one who swore allegiance to the German Free
State and to give him a big kiss. Unfortunately Gustav and Amalia were taken
prisoner and languished in gaol where the imperturbable Gustav at once resumed
his republican translation of Rotteck's <i>History of the World</i> until he
was liberated by the outbreak of the third insurrection. Gustav now became a
member of a real provisional government and the mania for provisional
governments was now added to his other <i>idées fixes.</i> As President of
the War Council he hastened to introduce as much muddle as possible into his
department and to recommend the "traitor" Mayerhofer for the post of Minister
for War (vice Goegg, <i>Retrospect</i>, Paris 1850). Later he vainly aspired
to the post of Foreign Minister and to have 60,000 Florins placed at his
disposal. Mr. Brentano soon relieved Gustav of the burdens of government and
Gustav now entered the "Club of Resolute Progress" from which he became leader
of the opposition. He delighted above all in opposing the very measures of
Brentano which he had hitherto supported. Even though the Club too was
disbanded and Gustav had to flee to the Palatinate this disaster had its
positive side for it enabled him to issue one further number of the inevitable
<i>Deutscher Zuschauer</i> in Neustadt an der Haardt — this compensated
Gustav for much undeserved suffering. A further satisfaction was that he was
successful in a by-election in some remote corner of the uplands and was
nominated member of the Baden Constituent Assembly which meant that he could
now return in an official capacity. In this Assembly Gustav only distinguished
himself by the following three proposals that he put forward in Freiburg: (1)
On June 28th: everyone who enters into dealings with the enemy should be
declared a traitor. (2) On June 30th: a new provisional government should be
formed in which Struve would have a seat and a vote. (3) On the same day that
the previous motion was defeated he proposed that as the defeat at Rastatt had
rendered all resistance futile the uplands should be spared the terrors of war
and that therefore all officials and soldiers should receive ten days' wages
and members of the Assembly should receive ten days' expenses together with
travelling costs after which they should all repair to Switzerland to the
accompaniment of trumpets and drums. When this proposal too was rejected Gustav
set out for Switzerland on his own and having been driven from thence by James
Fazy's stick he retreated to London where he at once came to the fore with yet
another discovery, namely the Six <i>scourges of mankind.</i> These six
scourges were: the princes, the nobles, the priests, the bureaucracy, the
standing army, mammon and bedbugs. The spirit in which Gustav interpreted the
lamented Rotteck can be gauged from the further discovery that mammon was the
invention of Louis Philippe. Gustav preached the gospel of the six scourges in
the <i>Deutsche Londoner Zeitung</i> [German London News] which belonged to
the ex-Duke of Brunswick. He was amply rewarded for this activity and in return
he gratefully bowed to the ducal censorship. So much for Gustav's relations
with the first scourge, the princes. As for his relationship with the nobles,
the second scourge, our moral and religious republican had visiting cards
printed on which he figured as "Baron von Struve". If his relations with the
remaining scourges were less amicable this cannot be his fault. Gustav then
made use of his leisure time in London to devise a republican calendar in which
the saints were replaced by right-minded men and the names "Gustav" and
"Amelia" were particularly prominent. The months were designated by German
equivalents of those in the calendar of the French Republic and there were a
number of other commonplaces for the common good. For the rest, the remaining
<i>idées fixes</i> made their appearance again in London: Gustav made haste
to revive the <i>Deutscher Zuschauer</i> and the Club of Resolute Progress
and to form a provisional government. On all these matters he found himself of
one mind with Schramm and in this way the circular came into being.</p>
<p>The third member of the alliance, the great <i>Arnold Ruge</i> with his
air of a sergeant-major living in hopes of civilian employment outshines in
glory the whole of the emigration. It cannot be said that this noble man
commends himself by his notably handsome exterior; Paris acquaintances were
wont to sum up his Pomeranian-Slav features with the word "ferret-face"
<i>(figure de fouine).</i> Arnold Ruge, the son of peasants of the isle of
Rugen, had endured seven years in Prussian prisons for democratic agitation. He
embraced Hegelian philosophy as soon as he had realised that once he had leafed
through Hegel's <i>Encyclopaedia</i> he could dispense with the study of all
other science. He also developed the principle (described in a Novelle and
which he attempted to practice on his friends — poor Georg Herwegh can
vouch for the truth of this), of profiting from marriage and he early acquired
a "substantial property" in this manner.</p>
<p>Despite his Hegelian phrases and his substantial property he did not advance
beyond the post of porter to German philosophy. In the
<i>Hallische-Jahrbücher</i> [Halle Annals] and the
<i>Deutsche-Jahrbücher</i> [German Annals] it was his task to announce and to
trumpet the names of the great philosophers of the future and he showed that he
was not without talent in exploiting them for his own purposes. Unfortunately,
the period of philosophical anarchy soon supervened, that period when science
no longer had a universally acknowledged king, when Strauss, Bruno Bauer and
Feuerbadh fought among themselves and when the most diverse alien elements
began to disrupt the simplicity of classical doctrine. Ruge looked on
helplessly, he no longer knew which path to take; his Hegelian categories had
always operated in a vacuum, now they ran completely amok and he suddenly felt
the need for a mighty movement in which exact thought and writing were not
indispensable.</p>
<p>Ruge played the same role in the <i>Hallische Jahrbücher</i> as the late
bookseller Nicolai had done in the old <i>Berliner Monatsschrft</i> [Berlin
Monthly Magazine]. Like the latter his ambition was to print the works of
others and in so doing, to derive material advantage and also to quarry
literary sustenance for the effusions of his own brain. The only difference was
that in this literary digestive process with its inevitable end product Ruge
went much further than did his model in rewriting his collaborators' articles.
Moreover, Ruge was not the porter of German Enlightenment, he was the Nicolai
of modern German philosophy and thus was able <i>to</i> conceal the natural
banality of his genius behind a thick hedge of speculative jargon. Like Nicolai
he fought valiantly against <i>Romanticism</i> because Hegel had demolished
it philosophically in <i>the aesthetics</i> and Heine had done the same thing
from the point of view of literature in <i>The Romantic School.</i> Unlike
Hegel he agreed with Nicolai in arrogating to himself the right as an
anti-Romantic to set up a vulgar Philistinism and above all his own Philistinic
self as an ideal of perfection. With this in mind and so as to defeat the enemy
on his own ground Ruge went in for making verses. No Dutchman could have
achieved the dull flatness of these poems which Ruge hurled so challengingly
into the face of Romanticism.</p>
<p>And in general our Pomeranian thinker did not really feel at ease in
Hegelian philosophy. Able as he was in detecting contradictions he was all the
more feeble in resolving them and he had a very understandable horror of
dialectics. The upshot was that the crudest possible contradictions dwelt
peaceably together in his dogmatic brain and that his powers of understanding,
never very agile, were nowhere more at home than in such mixed company. It is
not unknown for him to read simultaneously two articles by two different
writers and to conflate them into a single new product without noticing that
they had been written from two opposing viewpoints. Always riding firmly
between his own contradictions he sought to extricate himself from condemnation
by the theorists by declaring his faulty theory to be "practical", while at the
same time he would disarm the practical by interpreting his practical
clumsiness and inconsequentiality as theoretical expertise. He would end by
sanctifying his own entanglement in insoluble contradictions, his chaotically
uncritical faith in popular slogans by regarding them as proof that he was a
man of "principle".</p>
<p>Before we go on to concern ourselves with the further career of our Maurice
of Saxony, as he liked to style himself in his intimate circle or friends, we
would point to two qualities which made their appearance already in the
<i>Jahrbücher.</i> <span class="context">[Deutsche Jahrbücher, edited by
Ruge]</span> The first is his <i>mania for manifestos.</i> No sooner had
someone hatched a novel opinion that Ruge believed to have a future than he
would issue a manifesto. As no-one reproaches him with ever having given birth
to an original thought of his own, such manifestos were always suitable
opportunity to claim this novel idea as his own property in a more or less
declamatory fashion. This would be followed by the attempt to form a party, a
"mass" which would stand behind him and to whom he could act as sergeant-major.
We shall see later to what unbelievable heights of perfection Ruge had
developed the art of fabricating manifestos, proclamations and pronunciamentos.
The second quality is the particular <i>diligence</i> in which Arnold excels.
As he does not care to study overmuch, or as he puts it “to transfer
ideas from one library into another”, he prefers to gain his knowledge
“fresh from life”. He means by this to note down conscientiously
every evening all the witty, novel or bright ideas that he has read, heard or
just picked up during the day. As opportunity arises these materials are then
made to contribute to Ruge's daily stint which he labours at just as
conscientiously as at his other bodily needs. It is this that his admirers
refer to when they say that he cannot hold his ink. The subject of his daily
literary production is a matter of complete indifference; what is vital is that
Ruge should be able to immerse every possible topic in that wonderful stylistic
sauce that goes with everything just like the English who enjoy their Soyer's
relish or Worcester Sauce equally with fish, fowl, cutlets or anything else.
This daily stylistic diarrhoea he likes to designate the “all-pervading
beautiful form” and he regards it as adequate grounds for passing himself
off as an artist.</p>
<p>Contented as Ruge was to be the Swiss guard of German philosophy he still
had a secret sorrow gnawing at his innermost vitals. He had not written a
single large book and had daily to envy the happy Bruno Bauer who had published
18 fat volumes while still a young man. To reduce the discrepancy Ruge had one
and the same essay printed three times in one and the same volume under
different titles and then brought out the same volume in a number of different
formats. In this way Arnold Ruge's <i>Complete Works</i> came into being and
even today he derives much pleasure from counting them every morning volume by
volume as they stand there neatly bound in his library, whereupon he exclaims
joyfully: “And anyway, Bruno Bauer is a man without principles!”</p>
<p>Even though Arnold did not manage to comprehend the Hegelian system of
philosophy, he did succeed in representing one Hegelian category in his own
person. He was the very incarnation of the “honest consciousness”
and was strengthened in this when he made the pleasant discovery in the
<i>Phenomenology —</i> a book that was otherwise closed to him and
bound with seven seals — that the honest consciousness “always has
pleasure in itself”. Though he wears his integrity on his sleeve the
honest consciousness uses it to conceal the petty malice and crotchetiness of
the Philistine; he has the right to allow himself every kind of base action
because he knows that his baseness springs from honest motives. His very
stupidity becomes a virtue because it is an irrefutable proof that he stands up
for his principles. Despite every <i>arrière pensée</i> he is firmly
convinced of his own integrity and however base or filthy an intended act may
be it does not prevent him from appearing sincere and trusting. Beneath the
halo of good intentions all the petty meannesses of the citizen become
transformed into as many virtues; sordid self-interest appears as an innocent
babe when dressed up to look like a piece of self-sacrifice; cowardice appears
disguised as a higher form of courage, baseness becomes magnanimity, and the
coarse manners of the peasant become ennobled, and indeed transfigured into the
signs of decency and good humour. This is the gutter into which the
contradictions of philosophy, democracy and the cliché industry all pour; such
a man is moreover richly endowed with all the vices, the mean and petty
qualities, with the slyness and the stupidity, the greed and the clumsiness,
the servility and the arrogance, the untrustworthiness and the bonhomie of the
emancipated serf, the peasant; Philistine and ideologist, atheist and slogan
worshipper, absolute ignoramus and absolute philosopher all in one — that
is Arnold Ruge as Hegel foretold him in 1806.</p>
<p>After the <i>Deutsche Jahrbücher</i> were suppressed Ruge transported his
family to Paris in a carriage specially designed for the purpose. Here, his
unlucky star brought him into contact with <i>Heine</i> who honoured him as
the man who "had translated Hegel into Pomeranian". Heine asked him whether
Prutz was not a pseudonym of his which Ruge could deny in good conscience.
However, it was not possible to make Heine believe that anyone but Arnold was
the author of Prutz's poems. Heine also discovered very soon that even though
Ruge had no talent he knew very well how to give the appearance of being a man
of character. Thus it came about that Friend Arnold gave Heine the idea for his
<i>Atta Troll.</i> If Ruge was not able to immortalise his sojourn in Paris
by writing a great work he at least deserves our thanks for the one Heine
produced for him. In gratitude the poet wrote for him this well-known
epitaph:</p>
<p></p>
<p class="indentb">Atta Troll, Tendenzbär; sittlich</p>
<p class="indentb">Religiös; als Gatte brünstig;</p>
<p class="indentb">Durch Verführtsein von dem Zeitgeist</p>
<p class="indentb">Waldursprünglich Sansculotte;</p>
<p class="indentb">Sehr schlecht tanzend, doch Gesinnung</p>
<p class="indentb">Tragend in der zott'gen Hochbrust;</p>
<p class="indentb">Manchmal auch gestunken habend;</p>
<p class="indentb">Kein Talent, doch ein Charakter!</p>
<p class="indentb">[Atta Troll, performing bear, <br>
Pure and pious; a passionate husband, <br>
By the Zeitgeist led astray <br>
A backwoods sansculotte, <br>
Dances badly but ideals <br>
Dwell within his shaggy breast <br>
Often stinking very strongly — <br>
Talent none, but Character]</p>
<p class="fst">In Paris our Arnold experienced the misfortune of becoming
involved with the Communists. He published articles by Marx and Engels in the
<i>Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher</i> that contained views running directly
counter to those he had himself announced in the Preface, an accident to which
the <i>Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung</i> drew his attention but which he bore
with philosophical resignation.</p>
<p>To overcome an innate social awkwardness Ruge has collected a small number
of curious anecdotes that could be used on any occasion. He calls these
anecdotes jokes. His preoccupation with these jokes, sustained over many years,
finally led to the transformation of all events, situations and circumstances
into a series of pleasant or unpleasant, good or bad, important or trivial,
interesting or boring jokes. The Paris upheavals, the many new impressions,
socialism, politics, the Palais-Royal, the cheapness of the oysters — all
these things wrought so powerfully on the mind of this unhappy wretch that his
head went round and round in a permanent and incurable whirl of jokes and Paris
itself became an unlimited storehouse of jokes. One of the brightest of these
jokes was the idea of using wood shavings to make coats for the proletariat and
in general he had a foible for industrial jokes for which he could never find
enough share-holders.</p>
<p>When the better known Germans were expelled from France Ruge contrived to
avoid this fate by presenting himself to the minister, Duchâtel, as a
<i>savant sérieux.</i> He evidently had in mind the scholar in Paul de Kock's
<i>Amant de la lune</i>, who established himself as a <i>savant</i> by
means of an original device for propelling corks through the air. Shortly
afterwards Arnold went to Switzerland where he joined forces with a former
Dutch NCO, Cologne writer and Prussian tax subinspector, called
<i>Heinzen.</i> Both were soon bound together by the bonds of the most
intimate friendship. Heinzen learnt philosophy from Ruge, Ruge learnt politics
from Heinzen. From this time on we detect in Ruge a growing necessity to appear
as a philosopher par excellence only among the coarser elements of the German
movement, a fate that led him down and down until at last he was accepted as a
philosopher only by non-conformist parsons (Dulon), German catholic parsons
(Ronge) and Fanny Lewald. At the same time anarchy was growing apace in German
philosophy. Stirner's <i>The Self and its Own</i>, Stein's <i>Socialism,
Communism</i>, etc., all recent intruders, drove Ruge's sense of humour to
breaking-point: a great leap must be ventured. So Ruge escaped into
<i>humanism</i>, the slogan with which all Confusionists in Germany from
Reuchlin to Herder have covered up their embarrassment. This slogan seemed all
the more appropriate as Feuerbach had only recently "rediscovered man" and
Arnold fastened on to it with such desperation that he has not let go of it to
this day. But while still in Switzerland Arnold made yet another, incomparably
greater discovery. This was that "the ego by <i>appearing frequently</i>
before the public proves itself a <i>character".</i> From this point on a new
field of activity opened for Arnold. He now erected the most shameless meddling
and interfering into a principle. Ruge had to poke his nose into everything. No
hen could lay an egg without Ruge "commenting on the reason underlying the
event". Contact had to be maintained at all cost with every obscure local paper
where there was a chance of making frequent appearances. He wrote no newspaper
articles without signing his name and, where possible, mentioning himself. The
principle of the frequent appearance had to be extended to every article; an
article had first to appear in letter form in the European papers (and after
Heinzen's emigration, in the American papers also), it was then reprinted as a
pamphlet and appeared again finally in the collected works.</p>
<p>Thus equipped Ruge could now return to Leipzig to obtain definitive
recognition of his <i>character.</i> But once arrived all was not a bed of
roses. His old friend Wigand, the bookseller, had very successfully replaced
him in the role of Nicolai and as no other post was vacant Ruge fell into
gloomy reflections on the transitoriness of all jokes. This was his situation
when the German Revolution broke out.</p>
<p>For him too it came in the hour of need. The mighty movement in which even
the clumsiest could easily swim with the current had finally got underway and
Ruge went to Berlin where he intended to fish in troubled waters. As a
<i>revolution</i> had just broken out he felt that it would be appropriate
for him to come forward with proposals for reform. So he founded a paper with
that name. The pre-revolutionary <i>Réforme</i> of Paris had been the most
untalented, illiterate and boring paper in France. The Berlin <i>Reform</i>
demonstrated that it was possible to surpass its French model and that one need
not blush at offering German public such an incredible journal even in the
&amp;ldquo;metropolis of intelligence&amp;rdquo;. On the assumption that Ruge's
defective grasp of style contained the best guarantee for the profound content
lying behind and beneath it Arnold was elected to the Frankfurt Parliament as
Member for Breslau. Here he saw his chance as editor of the democratic
Left-wing to come forward with an absurd <i>manifesto.</i> Apart from that he
distinguished himself only by his passion for issuing <i>manifestos for
European People's Congresses</i>, and hastened <i>to</i> add his voice to
the general wish that Prussia should be absorbed into Germany. Later, on his
return to Berlin he demanded that Germany should be swallowed up by Prussia and
Frankfurt by Berlin and when he finally decided to become a peer of Saxony he
proposed that Prussia and Germany should both be swallowed up by Dresden.</p>
<p>His parliamentary activity brought him no laurels other than the fact that
his own party despaired at so much folly. <i>At the same time</i> his
<i>Reform</i> was going downhill, a situation that could only be remedied, as
he thought, by his personal presence in Berlin. As an “honest
consciousness” it goes without saying that he also discovered an urgent
political reason for taking such a step and in fact he demanded that the whole
of the Left should accompany him there. Naturally, they refused and Ruge went
to Berlin alone. Once there, he discovered that modern conflicts can best be
resolved by the "Dessau method" as he termed the small state, a model of
constitutional democracy. Then during the siege <span class="context">[of
Vienna] </span>he again drew up a manifesto in which General <i>Wrangel</i>
was exhorted to march against Windischgraetz and free Vienna. He even obtained
the approval of the democratic Congress for this curious document by pointing
out that the type had been set up and that it was already being printed.
Finally, when Berlin itself came under siege, Ruge went to Manteuffel and made
proposals concerning the <i>Reform</i>, which were, however, rejected.
Manteuffel told him that he wished all opposition papers were like the
<i>Reform</i>, the <i>Neue Preussische Zeitung</i> <a href="notes.html#n32" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[32]</sup></a> was much more dangerous
to him — an utterance which the naive Ruge, with a tone of triumphant
pride, hastened to report through the length and breadth of Germany. Arnold
became an enthusiastic advocate of <i>passive resistance</i> which he himself
put into practice by leaving his paper, editors and everything in the lurch and
running away. Active flight is evidently the most resolute form of passive
resistance. The counter-revolution had arrived and Ruge fled before it all the
way from Berlin <i>to</i> London without stopping.</p>
<p>At the time of the May uprising in Dresden <a href="notes.html#n33" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[33]</sup></a> Arnold placed himself at the head of the movement
in Leipzig together with his friend Otto Wigand and the city council. He and
his allies issued a vigorous manifesto to the citizens of Dresden urging them
to fight bravely; Ruge, Wigand and the city fathers, it went on, were sitting
watching in Leipzig and whoever did not desert himself would not be deserted by
Heaven. Scarcely had the manifesto been published than our brave Arnold took to
his heels and fled to Karlsruhe.</p>
<p>In Karlsruhe he felt unsafe even though the Baden troops were standing on
the Neckar and hostilities were a long way from breaking out. He asked Brentano
to send him to Paris as ambassador. Brentano permitted himself the joke of
giving him the post for 12 hours and then revoking it just when Ruge was about
to depart. Undaunted, Ruge still went to Paris together with Schutz and Blind,
the official representatives of the Brentano government, and once there made
such a spectacle of himself that his former editor announced in the official
<i>Karlsruhe Zeitung</i> that Mr. Ruge was not in Paris in any official
capacity but merely “on his own initiative”. Having once been taken
along by Schutz and Blind to see Ledru-Rollin Ruge suddenly interrupted the
diplomatic negotiations with a terrible diatribe against the Germans in the
presence of the Frenchmen so that his colleagues finally had to withdraw
discomfited and compromised. June 13th <a href="notes.html#n34" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[34]</sup> </a>came and dealt our Arnold such a severe blow that
he took to his heels and did not pause to take breath again until he found
himself in London, on free British soil. Referring to this fight later he
compared himself to Demosthenes.</p>
<p>In London Ruge first attempted to pass himself off as the Baden provisional
ambassador. He then tried to gain acceptance in the English press as a great
German writer and thinker but was turned away on the grounds that the English
were too materialistic ever to understand German philosophy. He was also asked
about his works — a request which Ruge could answer only with a sigh
while the image of Bruno Bauer once again rose up before his eyes. For even his
Collected Works, what were they but reprints of pamphlets? And they were not
even pamphlets but merely newspaper articles in pamphlet form, and basically
they were not even newspaper articles but only the muddled fruits of his
reading. Action was necessary and so Ruge wrote two articles for the
<i>Leader</i> in which under the pretext of an analysis of German democracy
he declared that in Germany <i>"humanism"</i> was the order of the day as
represented by Ludwig Feuerbach and Arnold Ruge, the author of the following
works: (1) <i>The Religion of our Age</i>, (2)<i>Democracy and
Socialism</i>, (3)<i>Philosophy and the Revolution.</i> These three
epoch-making works which have not appeared in the bookshops to this day are, it
goes without saying, nothing more than new titles arbitrarily applied to old
essays of Ruge's. Simultaneously he resumed his daily stints when for his own
edification, for the benefit of the German public and to the horror of Mr.
Brüggemann <a href="notes.html#n35" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[35]</sup></a> he began to retranslate articles
into German that had somehow got out of the <i>Kölnische Zeitung</i> and into
the <i>Morning Advertiser.</i> Not exactly burdened with laurels he withdrew
to Ostend where he found the leisure necessary to his preparations for the role
of universal sage, the <i>Confucius of the German Emigration.</i></p>
<p>Just as Gustav was the vegetable and Gottfried the sensibility of the German
petty-bourgeois Philistine, Arnold is representative of its
<i>understanding</i> or rather its <i>non-understanding.</i> Unlike Arnold
Winkelried <a href="notes.html#n36" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[36]</sup></a> he does not open up a path to
freedom [der Freiheit eine Gasse]; he is in his own person the gutter of
freedom [der Freiheit eine Gosse]; Ruge stands in the German revolution like
the notices seen at the corner of certain streets: It is permitted to pass
water here.</p>
<p>We return at last to our circular with its covering letter. It fell flat and
the first attempt to create a united democratic church came to nought. Schramm
and Gustav later declared that failure was due solely to the circumstance chat
Ruge could neither speak French nor write German. But then the heroes again set
to work.</p>

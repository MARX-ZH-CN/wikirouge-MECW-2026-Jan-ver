<p class="fst">Not often one can use a word like hilarious with Karl and Fred
(though Fred was usually a much more lively and rapid writer), but <i>Heroes
of the Exile</i> can be very funny. Wasn't published in his lifetime, though
he intended it to be... (that is, it wasn't an "unfinished work" in the sense
the Economic and Philsophical Manuscripts were, say).</p>
<p class="fst">Here's a snippet from translator Rodney Livingstone's 1970 intro
to <i>Heroes</i> -- </p>
<p class="fst" style="margin-left: 90px; margin-right: 90px;">This pamphlet is
one of Marx's most brilliant satirical achievements. Its excellence as satire
stands out all the more clearly for the fact that, unlike many of his other
works which have a satirical element, the prime purpose of the work is
satirical: a polemic on the world of German emigres with its venomous
internecine struggles, its petty personality conflicts, complicated intrigues,
pretentious political manoeuvres and sordid compromises with the realities of
living in exile with "dubious sources of income".</p>
<p class="fst" style="margin-left: 90px; margin-right: 90px;">It would be a
mistake to suppose that the work was actuated by malice, that it was merely a
series of personal attacks on people who irritated Marx. It is often supposed
that Marx was essentially a heavy, humourless man and that if his works contain
humour it is the expression only of a ponderous, "Germanic" predilection for
sarcasm without true wit or feeling. His talent for polemic is then seen as
springing from an almost obsessive compulsion to win, to be in the right, to
beat down all opposition. That is to say, his scorn, often couched in
scatological imagery, is held to be violent and authoritarian, and rooted in an
emotionally impoverished psyche. Of course, it is thought permissible for him
to inveigh against the evils of the capitalist system. It is when, as here, his
heaviest cannon are summoned up to demolish unimportant, perhaps mistaken but
often very sincere fellow revolutionaries, that his irony is called in
question.</p>
<p class="fst" style="margin-left: 90px; margin-right: 90px;">This view of Marx
is perhaps more often felt than stated, more often stated than reasoned. I feel
that it is based on a misunderstanding, often wilful, on the part of his
detractors. But even his admirers may in part be responsible for the
misconception in that their own practice on occasion emulates this stereotype
rather than Marx's own manner of writing. Thus one often observes a sarcasm
uttered in a tone of didactic complacency, as if the speaker were somehow
privileged always to be in the right. Such complacency is, I feel, alien to
Marx who is at once too humorous and too passionate to have room for
self-congratulation. Moral feeling is certainly very powerful in him but it is
prevented from degenerating into dogmatism by the fact that his moral
perceptions are bound up so completely with the dialectic with its ironies and
its "ruses of reason". Of course, there is anger and indignation in the Heroes:
the Kinkels and Ruges are not just figures of fun. They were often
irresponsible and dangerous enough to constitute a real threat in the
treacherous, spy-ridden emigration.</p>
<p class="fst" style="margin-left: 90px; margin-right: 90px;">Thus the Heroes
should not be regarded as an act of personal revenge. If it were so it would
have lost much of its interest for us if only because the objects of Marx's
polemic are now largely forgotten. Kinkel may have been a "great man" in his
day, but who knows of Kinkel now? This situation is often met with in satire
and here as everywhere we must search for a deeper underlying theme. For there
is no doubt that the pamphlet still lives today and if that is true its
survival must be due to themes of greater permanence than their ostensible
subjects.</p>

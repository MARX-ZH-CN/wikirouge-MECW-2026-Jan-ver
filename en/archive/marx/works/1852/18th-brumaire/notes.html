<p class="title">Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte. Marx 1852</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<p class="information"><a id="n64"><span class="info">64.</span></a> <i>The
Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte</i> (Der achtzehnte Brumaire des Louis
Bonaparte) was written by Marx from December 1851 to March 1852, immediately
following the coup d’état in France engineered by the French President,
who called himself “Louis Napoleon.” In the course of his work on
the book Marx constantly exchanged views with Engels concerning these events.
Thus, in this book Marx developed some of the ideas contained in <a href="../../1851/letters/51-12-03.html" target=_blank>Engels’ letter of December 3,
1851</a>, in particular the ironical comparison of the Bonapartist coup
d’état of December 2, 1851 with the coup of November 9, 1799 (the 18th
Brumaire according to the republican calendar), as a result of which the
Directory was overthrown and a dictatorship set up under General Napoleon
Bonaparte, who was proclaimed First Consul and later, in 1804, Emperor of the
French. Besides periodicals and official documents, Marx also used private
letters from Paris as his sources.</p>
<p class="information"><i>The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte </i>was
originally intended as a series of articles in the weekly <i>Die Revolution,
</i>which was being prepared for publication by Joseph Weydemeyer, a friend of
Marx and Engels and a member of the Communist League in the United States. But
Weydemeyer managed to put out only two issues (January 1852), following which
publication ceased for lack of funds. Marx’s articles arrived too late
for inclusion. On Marx’s advice, Weydemeyer published this work in May
1852 as the first issue of the “non-periodic journal” <i>Die
Revolution, </i>and provided it with a short preface. In giving it the title
<i>The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon, </i>Weydemeyer failed to take
into account that throughout the book Marx referred to the chief initiator of
the coup d’état as Louis Bonaparte, which he did deliberately (see his
letter to <a href="../../1852/letters/52-06-11.html" target=_blank>Jenny Marx of June 11,
1852</a>). Being in financial straits, Weydemeyer could not buy up the bulk of
the impression from the print-shop, and only a small number of copies reached
Europe. All attempts to publish the book in Germany or England (in an English
translation) were unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="information">The second edition of the book, this time under the
title <i>The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, </i>appeared only in
1869. For this edition Marx revised the text, corrected a large number of
misprints, mainly in accordance with the list appended to the 1852 edition,
eliminated repetitions, abridged certain passages, and wrote a preface dated
June 23, 1869, in which he described the editorial work he had done as follows:
“A revision of the present work would have robbed it of its peculiar
colouring. Accordingly I have confined myself to mere correction of
printer’s errors and to striking out allusions now no longer
intelligible.” This 1869 edition is the one translated here, but since
the passages omitted by Marx are of great interest because they show how he
revised the book and, in a number of cases (especially the abridgments in
Chapter VII) because of their theoretical content, they are reproduced in this
volume as footnotes.</p>
<p class="information">The third edition came out in 1885 under the editorship
of Engels and with his preface. The text in the main coincided with that of the
1869 edition. Passages from <i>The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte
</i>were published in <i>Der Sozialdemokrat, </i>an illegal organ of the
German Social-Democratic Party, on March 18, 1887 (No. 12) and on March 16,
1889 (No. 11). During Engels lifetime two translations were made from the 1885
edition: a French translation (published in <i>Le Socialiste, </i>organ of
the Workers’ Party of France. From January to November 1891, and in a
separate pamphlet that appeared in Lille the same year) and a Russian
translation (appeared as a pamphlet in Geneva in 1894).</p>
<p class="information">In English, excerpts from this work were first published
in “A Review of the Literature on the <i>Coup d’état </i>by Georg
Eccarius, a Communist League member, which was printed in the Chartist
<i>People’s Paper </i>from September to December 1852. In the last
section of this review, printed on December 18 1852, Eccarius quoted long
passages from Chapter 1 of <i>The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte</i>.
In English this work was first published in full in <i>The People, </i>the
weekly of the Socialist Labour Party of the United States, in
September-November 1897. It was published in book form in New York in 1898. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n65"><span class="info">65.</span></a> Hegel
expressed this idea in his work <i>Vorlesungen über die Philosophie der
Geschichte </i>(its first edition came out in Berlin in 1837). In the third
part of this work, at the end of Section 2, entitled “Vom der zweiten
punischen Krieg bis zum Kaiserthum,” Hegel wrote in particular that
“A coup d’état is sanctioned as it were in the opinion of people if
it is repeated. Thus, Napoleon was defeated twice and twice the Bourbons were
driven out. Through repetition, what at the beginning seemed to be merely
accidental and possible becomes real and established.” Hegel also
repeatedly expressed the idea that in the process of dialectical development
there is bound to be a transition from the stage of formation and efflorescence
to that of disintegration and ruin (see, in particular, G.W.F.Hegel,
<i>Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts, </i>Th. 3, Abt. 3, §347).
Developing this thought and Hegel’s idea about the recurrence of
historical phenomena Marx wrote in his <i>Contribution to the Critique of
Hegel’s Philosophy of Right</i>. <i>Introduction </i>(end of
1843-beginning of 1844): “History is thorough and goes through many
phases when carrying an old form to the grave. The last phase of a
world-historical form is its <i>comedy.</i>” A similar interpretation
of Hegel’s idea, albeit in the form of a vague hint, can be found in
Marx’s article “The Deeds of the Hohenzollern Dynasty”
written in 1849.</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n66"><span class="info">66.</span></a>
<i>Montagne</i> (the Mountain) – representatives in the Constituent and
subsequently in the Legislative Assembly of a bloc of democrats and
petty-bourgeois socialists grouped round the newspaper <i>La Réforme</i>.
They called themselves Montagnards or the Mountain by analogy with the
Montagnards in the Convention of 1792-94. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n67"><span class="info">67.</span></a> An
allusion to the fact that, while in emigration in England, Louis Bonaparte
volunteered for the special constabulary (a police reserve consisting of
civilians) which helped the regular police disperse the Chartist demonstration
on April 10, 1848.</p>

<i>Marengo </i>(North Italy) Napoleon Bonaparte’s army, which had
crossed the Alps at the St. Bernard Pass, defeated the army of the Austrian
General Melas on June 14, 1800.</p>
<p class="information">“<i>A company of gendarmes to be sent across the
Jura</i>” – Marx refers here to the conflict between France and
Switzerland in December 1851-January 1852 over Louis Bonaparte’s demand
for the deportation of French republican refugees from Switzerland. The Jura
– a mountain range on the French-Swiss border.</p>
<p class="information"><i>Order of St. Andrew – </i>the highest order

to be recognised by the Russian Tsar Nicholas I. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n69"><span class="info">69.</span></a> On

Bible has it (Exodus 16:3), during the exodus of the Jews from Egypt the
faint-hearted among them, depressed by the difficulties of the journey and by
hunger, began to sigh for the days spent in captivity when they at least had
something to eat. The expression “to sigh for the fleshpots of
Egypt” became a proverb. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n71"><span class="info">71.</span></a> <i>Hic
Rhodus, hic salta</i>! (“Here is the rod, now jump!” –
meaning: here is situation, do what the situation demands!) – words
addressed to a swaggerer (in a fable by Aesop, “The Boasting
Traveller”) who claimed that he had made tremendous jumps. <i>Here is
the rose, here dance!</i> is a pun on the maxim used by Hegel in the preface
to his work <i>Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts. </i> See <a href="../../../../../glossary/terms/h/i.html#hic-rhodus" target=_blank>[MIA Encyclopedia]</a>
for clarification.</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n72"><span class="info">72.</span></a> In May
1852 Louis Bonaparte’s term of office as President expired. Under the
French Constitution of 1848, presidential elections were to be held every four
years on the second Sunday in May, and the outgoing President could not stand
for re-election. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n73"><span class="info">73.</span></a>
Chiliasts (from the Greek word chilias, a thousand) – preachers of a
mystical religious doctrine that Christ would come to earth a second time and
usher in a “millennium” of universal equality, justice and
well-being. Chiliastic belief, sprang up in the period of early Christianity
and were continuously revived in the doctrines of the various medieval sects
which voiced the sentiments of the peasants and the urban poor. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n74"><span class="info">74.</span></a> The
<i>dynastic </i>parties – the Legitimists (see Note 13) and the
Orleanists. The latter supported the House of Orleans, which was overthrown by
the February revolution of 1848. They represented the interests of the finance
aristocracy and the big bourgeoisie.</p>
<p class="information">The <i>blue republicans – </i>bourgeois
republicans; red republicans – democrats the socialists of various
trends.</p>
<p class="information">The <i>heroes of Africa</i> – Generals
Cavaignac, Lamoricière and Bedeau, took an active part in the colonial wars in
Algeria. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n75"><span class="info">75.</span></a> The
dynastic opposition-an opposition group in the French Chamber of Deputies
during the July monarchy (1830-48). The group, headed by Odilon Barrot,
expressed the views of the liberal industrial and commercial bourgeoisie and
favoured a moderate electoral reform, which they regarded as a means of
preventing a revolution and preserving the Orleans dynasty. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n76"><span class="info">76.</span></a> On April
16, 1848 a peaceful procession of Paris workers marched towards the Town Hall
to present a petition to the Provisional Government for “organisation of
labour” and “abolition of the exploitation of man by man.”
The workers encountered battalions of the bourgeois national guard and were
forced to retreat.</p>
<p class="information">On May 15, 1848 Paris workers led by Blanqui, Barbès and
others took revolutionary action against the anti-labour and anti-democratic
policy of the bourgeois Constituent Assembly which had opened on May 4. The
participants in the mass demonstration forced their way into the Assembly,
demanded the formation of a Ministry of Labour and presented a number of other
demands. An attempt was made to form a revolutionary government. National
guards from the bourgeois quarters and regular troops succeeded, however, in
restoring the power of the Constituent Assembly. The leaders of the movement
were arrested and put on trial. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n77"><span class="info">77.</span></a> The
Mobile Guard was set up by a decree of the Provisional Government on February
25, 1848 with the secret aim of fighting the revolutionary masses. Armed units
consisted mainly of lumpenproletarians and were used to crush the June uprising
of the Paris workers. Subsequently, it was disbanded on the insistence of the
Bonapartists, who feared that in the event of a conflict between President
Bonaparte and the republicans the Mobile Guard would side with the latter.</p>
<p class="information">For Marx’s description of the Mobile Guard see his
work <i>The Class Struggle in France, 1848 to 1850</i>.</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n78"><span class="info">78.</span></a> An
allusion to a legend according to which the Roman Emperor Constantine (274-337)
on the eve of a battle against his rival Maxentius in 312 saw in the sky the
sign of the Cross and over it the words: “By this sign thou shalt
conquer!” With this legend the Church links Constantine’s
“conversion” from the persecution of Christianity to its
protection. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n79"><span class="info">79.</span></a> The
<i>Vienna treaties-the </i>treaties and agreements concluded at the Congress
of Vienna held by European monarchs and their Ministers in 1814-15. They
established the borders and status of European states after the victory, over
Napoleonic France and sanctioned, contrary to the national interests and will
of the peoples, the reshaping of Europe’s political map and the
restoration of the “legitimate” dynasties overthrown as a result of
the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars. The Vienna treaties confirmed
France’s territory within the borders of 1790 and the restoration of the
Bourbons in France.</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n80"><span class="info">80.</span></a> On
February 24, 1848 Louis Philippe abdicated in favour of his grandson, the Count
of Paris. In view of the latter’s minority, his mother, the Duchess of
Orleans, was to assume the regency. But the King’s abdication failed to
halt the development of the revolution. Under pressure from the insurgent
masses a Provisional Government was set up which proclaimed a republic the next
day.</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n81"><span class="info">81.</span></a> The
<i>Executive Commission </i>(<i>Commission du pouvoir exécutif</i>) –
the Government of the French Republic set up by the Constituent Assembly on May
10, 1848 to replace the Provisional Government, which had resigned. It existed
until June 24, 1848, when Cavaignac’s dictatorship was established during
the June proletarian uprising. Composed mostly of moderate republicans, the
commission included Ledru-Rollin as a representative of the Left. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n82"><span class="info">82.</span></a> The text
of the <i>Constitution of the French Republic </i>was originally published in
<i>Le Moniteur universel, </i>No. 312, November 7, 1848, and the same year it
appeared as a pamphlet. Marx examined this document in 1851 in a special
article entitled “The Constitution of the French Republic”. In
<i>The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte </i>Marx often designates
articles of this Constitution as paragraphs (§§).</p>
<p class="information">The <i>constitutional Charter, </i>adopted after the
bourgeois revolution of 1830, was the fundamental law of the July monarchy.
Nominally the Charter proclaimed the sovereign rights of the nation and
restricted somewhat the king’s power. But the bureaucratic and police
apparatus remained intact, as did the severe laws against the working-class and
democratic movement. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n83"><span class="info">83.</span></a>
“<i>Frere, il faut mourir!” </i>(“Brother, one must
die!”) – this is how Trappists, monks of a Catholic order, greeted
each other. The order was founded in 1664 and was noted for its strict rules
and the ascetic life of its members. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n84"><span class="info">84.</span></a>
<i>Clichy</i> – a debtors’ prison in Paris from 1826 to 1867. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n85"><span class="info">85.</span></a> This
refers to the Cavaignac Government’s attitude towards the new
revolutionary upsurge in Italy that began in the autumn of 1848. Though
Cavaignac declared a policy of non-interference, he actually rendered
diplomatic aid to the ruling circles of the Kingdom of Naples and Austria in
their struggle against the Italian national liberation movement. When Pius IX
fled to the Neapolitan fortress of Gaeta after the popular uprising in Rome on
November 16, which started a series of events that resulted in the proclamation
of the Roman Republic on February 9, 1849, Cavaignac offered him asylum in
France. Incited by the French Government, Pius IX called on all Catholic states
on December 4, 1848 to intervene against the Roman revolutionaries, and Naples
and Austria immediately responded to this call. By his policy Cavaignac in
effect prepared for the dispatch of a French expeditionary corps against the
Roman Republic undertaken later by President Louis Bonaparte. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n86"><span class="info">86.</span></a> In 1832
Louis Bonaparte became a Swiss citizen in the canton of Thurgau; on his joining
the special constabulary in England, see Note 67. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n87"><span class="info">87.</span></a> An
ironical allusion to Louis Bonaparte’s book <i>Des Idées apoleoniennes.
</i>which he wrote in England and published in Paris and Brussels in 1839. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n88"><span class="info">88.</span></a> The
French Government managed to get allocations from the Constituent Assembly for
the dispatch to Italy of an expeditionary corps under General Oudinot in April
1849 on the pretext of defending Piedmont in its struggle against Austria, and
of protecting the Roman Republic. The true aim of the expedition was
intervention against the Roman Republic and restoration of the Pope’s
temporal power. (On this subject see also Marx’s <i>The Class Struggles
in France, 1848 to 1850</i>). </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n89"><span class="info">89.</span></a> The
reference is to the Bill introduced on November 6, 1851 by the royalists Lt.
Flô, Baze and Panat, questors of the Legislative Assembly (deputies of the
Assembly charged with economic and financial matters and safeguarding its
security). It was rejected on November 17 after a heated debate, in which
Thiers supported the Bill and the Bonapartist Saint-Arnaud opposed it. When the
vote was taken, the Montagne supported the Bonapartists because it saw the main
danger in the royalists. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n90"><span class="info">90.</span></a> On April
16, 1848 a peaceful procession of Paris workers marched towards the Town Hall
to present a petition to the Provisional Government for “organisation of
labour” and “abolition of the exploitation of man by man.”
The workers encountered battalions of the bourgeois national guard and were
forced to retreat.</p>

guards from the bourgeois quarters and regular troops succeeded, however, in
restoring the power of the Constituent Assembly. The leaders of the movement
were arrested and put on trial. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n91"><span class="info">91.</span></a> The
<i>Fronde</i> – a movement in France against the absolutist regime and
its prop, the government of Cardinal Mazarin. It was active from 1648 to 1653
and invoked various social sections, which in marry cases pursued opposite
aims, from radical peasant and plebeian elements and oppositional bourgeoisie,
to high-ranking officials who sought to maintain their privileges, and
aristocrats seeking lucrative posts, pensions and allowances. The defeat of the
Fronde led to the strengthening of absolutism. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n91a"><span class="info">91a.</span></a> Marx
refers here to a Fairy Tale of Hans Christian Andersen, 'The Shadow', published
in 1847, which was influenced by Chamisso's 'Peter Schlemihl'. There is a good
treatment of the story on Wikipedia. In the Andersen story, the character has
'lost' his shadow, as in Marx's reference; in Chamisso's story, he has sold it
to the devil. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n92"><span class="info">92.</span></a> The
ruling Bonapartist circles acid the counter-revolutionary the press, preparing
coup d’état of December 2, 1851, did everything they could to scare all
timid and law-abiding citizens by the prospect of anarchy, revolutionary plots,
a new Jacquerie and encroachments on property, during the presidential
election, scheduled for May 1852. A special roMle in this campaign was played
by the pamphlet <i>Le spectre rouge de 1852</i> (Brussels, 1851) by A.
Romieu, a former prefect of police. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n93"><span class="info">93.</span></a>
<i>Ems</i> – a health resort in Germany where a Legitimist conference
was held in August 1849; it was attended by the Count de Chambord, pretender to
the French throne under the name of Henry V.</p>
<p class="information"><i>Claremont – </i>a house near London,
residence of Louis Philippe after his flight from France. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n94"><span class="info">94.</span></a> Marx
uses the term “Haupt- und <i>Staatsaktionen”
</i>(“principal and spectacular actions”), which has several
meanings. In the seventeenth and the first half of the eighteenth century, it
denoted plays performed by, German touring companies. The plays, which were
rather formless, presented tragic historical events in a bombastic and at the
same time coarse and farcical way.</p>
<p class="information">Secondly, this term can denote major political events.
It was used in this sense by a trend in German historical science known as
“objective historiography” Leopold Ranke was one of its chief
representatives. He regarded Haupt- und <i>Staatsaktionen as </i>the main
subject-matter of history. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n95"><span class="info">95.</span></a> The
expeditionary corps under General Oudinot, sent to Italy by decision of
President Louis Bonaparte and the French Government, was driven back from Rome
by the troops of the Roman Republic on April 30, 1849. But, in violation of the
terms of the armistice signed by the French, Oudinot launched a new offensive
on June 3. Throughout the siege of Rome until the fall of the Republic on July
3, 1849 the city was repeatedly subjected to heavy bombardment.</p>
<p class="information">Article V belongs to the introductory part of the French
Constitution of 1848: the articles of the main part of the Constitution are
numbered in Arabic numerals. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n96"><span class="info">96.</span></a> On
August 10, 1849 the Legislative Assembly adopted a law under which
“instigators and supporters of the conspiracy, and the attempt of June
13” were liable to trial by the High Court. Thirty-four deputies of the
Montagne (Alexandre Ledru-Rollin, Felix Pyat and Victor Considerant among them)
were deprived of their mandates and put on trial (those who had emigrated were
tried by default).</p>
<p class="information">On June 13 the editorial offices of democratic and
socialist newspapers were raided and many of these papers were banned. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n97"><span class="info">97.</span></a> The
events in Paris sparked off an armed uprising of Lyons workers and artisans on
June 15, 1849. The insurgents occupied the Croix-Rousse district and erected
barricades there, but were overcome by troops after several hours of stubborn
fighting. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n98"><span class="info">98.</span></a> An
ironical allusion to the plans of Louis Napoleon, who expected to receive the
French Crown from the hands of Pius IX, whose temporal power he helped restore.
According to the Bible, David was anointed king by the prophet Samuel in
opposition to the Hebrew king Saul (1 Samuel 16 : 13).</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n99"><span class="info">99.</span></a> The
<i>battle of </i>Austerlitz between the Russo-Austrian and the French armies
on December 2, 1805 ended in victory for the French commanded by Napoleon I.</p>

<p class="information"><a id="n101"><span class="info">101.</span></a>
<i>The wine tax, </i>abolished as of January 1, 1850 by decision of the
Constituent Assembly, was re-introduced by a law of the Legislative Assembly on
December 1 20-21, 1849.</p>
<p class="information">The <i>education law, </i>which virtually placed the
schools under the control of the clergy, was adopted by the Legislative
Assembly on March 15-27, 1850. For an assessment of these laws see Karl Marx,
<i>The Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850</i>.</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n102"><span class="info">102.</span></a> The
reference is to the commission of 17 Orleanists and Legitimists- deputies of
the Legislative Assembly- appointed by the Minister of the Interior on May 1,
1850 to draft a new electoral law. Its members were nicknamed <i>burgraves,
</i>a name borrowed from the title of a historical drama by Victor Hugo, as an
allusion to their unwarranted claims to power and their reactionary
aspirations. The drama is set in medieval Germany, where the Burggraf was
governor, appointed by the emperor, of a <i>Burg </i>(city) or district. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n103"><span class="info">103.</span></a> From
March 7 to April 3, 1849 the leaders of the Paris workers’ uprising of
May 15, 1848 were tried at Bourges on a charge of conspiring against the
government. Barbés and Albert were sentenced to exile, Blanqui to ten years
solitary confinement and the rest of the accused to various terms of
imprisonment or exile.</p>
<p class="information">On April 16, 1848 a peaceful procession of Paris workers
marched towards the Town Hall to present a petition to the Provisional
Government for “organisation of labour” and “abolition of the

<p class="information"><a id="n104"><span class="info">104.</span></a> The
press law passed by the Legislative Assembly in July 1850 (“Loi sur le
cautionnement des journaux et le timbre des écrits périodiques et non
périodiques. 16-23 juillet 1850”) considerably increased the caution
money which newspaper publishers had to deposit, and introduced a stamp-duty,
which applied also to pamphlets. This new law was a continuation of reactionary
measures which virtually led to the abolition of freedom of the press in France
(see also Karl Marx, <i>The Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850</i>).</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n105"><span class="info">105.</span></a>
<i>Lazzaroni</i> – a contemptuous name for declassed proletarians,
primarily in the Kingdom of Naples. These people were repeatedly used by
reactionary governments against liberal and democratic movements. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n106"><span class="info">106.</span></a> The
reference is to French Guiana where political prisoners were sent for penal
servitude. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n107"><span class="info">107.</span></a> This
refers to Louis Bonaparte’s attempts during the July monarchy to stage a
coup d’état by means of a military mutiny. On October 30, 1836 he
succeeded, with the help of several Bonapartist officers, in inciting two
artillery regiments of the Strasbourg garrison to mutiny, but they were
disarmed within a few hours. Louis Bonaparte was arrested and deported to
America. On August 6, 1840, taking advantage of a partial revival of
Bonapartist sentiments in France, he landed in Boulogne with a handful of
conspirators and attempted to raise a mutiny among the troops of the local
garrison. This attempt likewise proved a failure. He was sentenced to life
imprisonment, but escaped to England in 1846.</p>

national <i>ateliers (workshops) </i>were instituted by the Provisional
Government immediately after the February revolution of 1848. By this means the
Government sought to discredit Louis Blanc’s ideas on “the
organisation of labour” in the eyes of the workers and, at the same time,
to utilise those employed in the national workshops, organised on military
lines, against the revolutionary proletariat. Revolutionary ideas, however,
continued to gain ground in the national workshops. The Government took steps
to reduce the number of workers employed in them, to send a large number off to
public works in the provinces and finally to liquidate the workshops. This
precipitated a proletarian uprising in Paris in June 1848. After its
suppression, the Cavaignac Government issued a decree on July 3, disbanding the
national workshops.</p>

parliaments in France-judicial institutions that came into being in the Middle
Ages. The Paris parliament was the highest court of appeal and also performed
important administrative and political functions, such as the registration of
royal decrees, without which they had no legal force. The parliaments enjoyed
the right to remonstrate against government decrees. In the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries they consisted of officials of high birth called the
“nobility of the mantle.” The parliaments ultimately became the
bulwark of Right-wing opposition to absolutism and impeded the implementation
of even moderate reforms, and were abolished during the French Revolution. in

Marx is drawing a parallel with a story told by the Greek writer Athenaeus
(2nd-3rd cent. A.D.) in his book Deipnosophistae (Dinner-Table Philosophers).
The Egyptian Pharaoh Tachos, alluding to the small stature of the Spartan King
Agesilaus, who had come with his troops to the Pharaoh’s help, said:
“The mountain was in labour. Zeus was afraid. But the mountain has
brought forth a mouse.” Agesilaus replied: “I seem to you now only
a mouse, but the time will come when I will appear to you like a lion.”

reference is to tactical disagreements in the Legitimist camp during the

introduction of reactionary measures while the Count d’Artois (King

advocated the complete restoration of the pre-revolutionary regime.</p>

December 4, 1851 government troops commanded by Bonapartist generals suppressed
a republican uprising directed against the coup d’état in Paris. The
uprising was led by a group of Left-wing deputies of the Legislative Assembly
and leaders of workers’ corporations and secret societies. Employing
cannon, the government troops destroyed the barricades erected by the defenders
of the Republic. While fighting the insurgents, drunken soldiers and officers
fired at passers-by, at customers in cafés and at spectators at windows and
balconies. Several bourgeois mansions were also damaged in this Bonapartist
terror.</p>

refers to the participation of peasants in the republican uprisings in France
in late 1851 in protest against the Bonapartist coup d’état. These
uprisings, involving mainly artisans and workers of small towns and
settlements, local peasants, tradesmen and intellectuals, embraced nearly
twenty departments in south-east, south-west and central France. Lacking unity
and centralisation they were fairly quickly suppressed by police and troops.

Marx compares the Bonapartist authorities’ reprisals against the
participants in the republican movement, including peasants, with the
persecution of the so-called demagogues in Germany in the 1820s and 1830s.</p>
<p class="information"><i>Demagogues </i>in<i></i>Germany were participants
in the opposition movement of <i>intellectuals. The </i>name became current
after the Karlsbad Conference of Ministers of the German States in August 1819,
which adopted a special decision against the intrigues of

reference is to German or “true socialism” which was widespread in
Germany in the 1840s, mostly among petty-bourgeois intellectuals. The
“true socialists” – Karl Grün, Moses Hess, Hermann Kriege
– substituted the sentimental preaching of love and brotherhood for the
ideas of socialism and denied the need for a bourgeois-democratic revolution in
Germany. Marx and Engels criticised this trend in the following works: <i>The
German Ideology</i>, <i>Circular Against Kriege, German Socialism in Verse
and Prose</i> and <i>Manifesto of the Communist Party. </i></p>

witticism of Countess Lehon and the caustic remark of Madame de Girardin on the
Bonapartist regime, which Marx quotes at the end of the paragraph, were
forwarded to him, together with many other items used in <i>The Eighteenth
Brumaire,</i> by Richard Reinhardt. a German refugee in Paris, Heinrich
Heine’s secretary, In his letter to Ferdinand Lassalle of February 23,
1852 Marx quotes a letter to him from Reinhardt, in the following passage:
“As for de Morny, the minister who resigned with Dupin, he was known as
the of his mistress’ (Countess Lehon’s) husband, which caused Emile
de Girardin’s wife to say that while it was not unprecedented for
governments to be in the hands of men who were governed by <i>their wives,
</i>none had ever been known to be in the hands of <i>hommes entretenus </i>
[kept men]. Well, this same Countess Lehon holds a salon where she is one of
Bonaparte’s most vociferous opponents and it was she who, on the occasion
of the confiscation of the Orleans’ estates let fall
‘<i>C’est le premier vol de l’aigle</i>’.<i></i>A
pun: “It is the first flight of the eagle” and “It is the
first theft of the eagle.”] Thanks to this remark of his wife’s,
Emile de Girardin was expelled.” . </p>

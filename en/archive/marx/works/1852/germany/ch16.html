<p class="title">Revolution and Counter-revolution in Germany</p>
<h1>XVI. <br>
The Assembly and the Governments</h1>
<h5>AUGUST 19th, 1852.</h5>
<p class="fst">THE National Assembly of Frankfort, after having elected the
King of Prussia Emperor of Germany <i>(minus </i>Austria), sent a deputation
to Berlin to offer him the crown, and then adjourned. On the 3rd of April,
Frederick William received the deputies. He told them that, although he
accepted the right of precedence over all the other princes of Germany, which
this vote of the people's representatives had given him, yet he could not
accept the Imperial crown as long as he was not sure that the remaining princes
acknowledged his supremacy, and the Imperial Constitution conferring those
rights upon him. It would be, he added, for the Governments of Germany to see
whether this Constitution was such as could be ratified by them. At all events,
Emperor or not, he always would be found ready, he concluded, to draw the sword
against either the external or the internal foe. We shall see how he kept his
promise in a manner rather startling for the National Assembly.</p>
<p>The Frankfort wiseacres, after profound diplomatic inquiry, at last came to
the conclusion that this answer amounted to a refusal of the crown. They then
(April 12th) resolved: That the Imperial Constitution was the law of the land,
and must he maintained; and not seeing their way at all before them, elected a
Committee of thirty, to make proposals as to the means how this Constitution
could be carried out.</p>
<p>This resolution was the signal for the conflict between the Frankfort
Assembly and the German Governments which now broke out. The middle classes,
and especially the smaller trading class, had all at once declared for the new
Frankfort Constitution. They could not wait any longer the moment which was "to
close the Revolution." In Austria and Prussia the Revolution had, for the
moment, been closed by the interference of the armed power. The classes in
question would have preferred a less forcible mode of performing that
operation, but they had not had a chance; the thing was done, and they had to
make the best of it, a resolution which they at once took and carried out most
heroically. In the smaller States, where things had been going on comparatively
smoothly, the middle classes had long since been thrown back into that showy,
but resultless, because powerless, parliamentary agitation, which was most
congenial to themselves. The different States of Germany, as regarded each of
them separately, appeared thus to have attained that new and definite form
which was supposed to enable them to enter henceforth the path of peaceful
constitutional development. There only remained one open question, that of the
new political organization of the German Confederacy. And this question, the
only one which still appeared fraught with danger, it was considered a
necessity to resolve at once. Hence the pressure exerted upon the Frankfort
Assembly by the middle classes, in order to induce it to get the Constitution
ready as soon as possible; hence the resolution among the higher and lower
bourgeoisie to accept and support this Constitution, whatever it might be, in
order to create a settled state of things without delay. Thus from the very
beginning the agitation for the Imperial Constitution arose out of a
reactionary feeling, and sprang up among these classes which were long since
tired of the Revolution.</p>
<p>But there was another feature in it. The first and fundamental principles of
the future German Constitution had been voted during the first months of spring
and summer, 1848, a time when popular agitation was still rife. The resolutions
then passed, though completely reactionary <i>then,</i> now, after the
arbitrary acts of the Austrian and Prussian Governments, appeared exceedingly
Liberal, and even Democratic. The standard of comparison had changed. The
Frankfort Assembly could not, without moral suicide, strike out these
once-voted provisions, and model the Imperial Constitution upon those which the
Austrian and Prussian Governments had dictated, sword in hand. Besides, as we
have seen, the majority in that Assembly had changed sides, and the Liberal and
Democratic party were rising in influence. Thus the Imperial Constitution not
only was distinguished by its apparently exclusive popular origin, but at the
same time, full of contradiction as it was, it yet was the most Liberal
Constitution in all Germany. Its greatest fault was, that it was a mere sheet
of paper, with no power to back its provisions.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances it was natural that the so-called Democratic
party, that is, the mass of the petty trading class, should cling to the
Imperial Constitution. This class had always been more forward in its demands
than the Liberal-Monarchico-Constitutional bourgeoisie; it had shown a bolder
front, it had very often threatened armed resistance, it was lavish in its
promises to sacrifice its blood and its existence in the struggle for freedom;
but it had already given plenty of proofs that on the day of danger it was
nowhere, and that it never felt more comfortable than the day after a decisive
defeat, when everything being lost, it had at least the consolation to know
that somehow or other the matter was settled. While, therefore, the adhesion of
the large bankers, manufacturers, and merchants was of a more reserved
character, more like a simple demonstration in favor of the Frankfort
Constitution, the class just beneath them, our valiant Democratic shopkeepers,
came forward in grand style, and, as usual, proclaimed they would rather spill
their last drop of blood than let the Imperial Constitution fall to the
ground.</p>
<p>Supported by these two parties, the bourgeois adherents of the
Constitutional Royalty, and the more or less Democratic shopkeepers, the
agitation for the immediate establishment of the Imperial Constitution gained
ground rapidly, and found its most powerful expression in the Parliaments of
the several States. The Chambers of Prussia, of Hanover, of Saxony, of Baden,
of Wurtemberg, declared in its favor. The struggle between the Governments and
the Frankfort Assembly assumed a threatening aspect.</p>
<p>The Governments, however, acted rapidly. The Prussian Chambers were
dissolved, anti-constitutionally, as they had to revise and confirm the
Constitution; riots broke out at Berlin, provoked intentionally by the
Government, and the next day, the 28th of April, the Prussian Ministry issued a
circular note, in which the Imperial Constitution was held up as a most
anarchical and revolutionary document, which it was for the Governments of
Germany to remodel and purify. Thus Prussia denied, point-blank that sovereign
constituent power which the wise men at Frankfort had always boasted of, but
never established. Thus a Congress of Princes, a renewal of the old Federal
Diet, was called upon to sit in judgment on that Constitution which had already
been promulgated as law. And at the same time Prussia concentrated troops at
Kreuznach, three days' march from Frankfort, and called upon the smaller States
to follow its example, by also dissolving their Chambers as soon as they should
give their adhesion to the Frankfort Assembly. This example was speedily
followed by Hanover and Saxony.</p>
<p>It was evident that a decision of the struggle by force of arms could not be
avoided. The hostility of the Governments, the agitation among the people, were
daily showing themselves in stronger colors. The military were everywhere
worked upon by the Democratic citizens, and in the south of Germany with great
success. Large mass meetings were everywhere held, passing resolutions to
support the Imperial Constitution and the National Assembly, if need should be,
with force of arms. At Cologne, a meeting of deputies of all the municipal
councils of Rhenish Prussia took place for the same purpose. In the Palatinate,
at Bergen, Fulda, Nuremberg, in the Odenwald, the peasantry met by myriads and
worked themselves up into enthusiasm. At the same time the Constituent Assembly
of France dissolved, and the new elections were prepared amid violent
agitation, while on the eastern frontier of Germany, the Hungarians had within
a month, by a succession of brilliant victories, rolled back the tide of
Austrian invasion from the Theiss to the Leitha, and were every day expected to
take Vienna by storm. Thus, popular imagination being on all hands worked up to
the highest pitch, and the aggressive policy of the Governments defining itself
more clearly every day, a violent collision could not be avoided, and cowardly
imbecility only could persuade itself that the struggle was to come off
peaceably. But this cowardly imbecility was most extensively represented in the
Frankfort Assembly.</p>

<p class="title">Revolution and Counter-revolution in Germany</p>
<h1>XIV. <br>
The Restoration of Order<br>
—Diet and Chamber</h1>
<h5>APRIL 24th, 1852</h5>
<p class="fst">THE first months of the year 1849 were employed by the Austrian
and Prussian Governments in following up the advantages obtained in October and
November, 1848. The Austrian Diet, ever since the takings of Vienna, had
carried on a merely nominal existence in a small Moravian country-town, named
Kremsir. Here the Slavonian deputies, who, with their constituents. had been
mainly instrumental in raising the Austrian Government from its prostration,
were singularly punished for their treachery against the European Revolution.
As soon as the Government had recovered its strength, it treated the Diet and
its Slavonian majority with the utmost contempt, and when the first successes
of the Imperial arms foreboded a speedy termination of the Hungarian War, the
Diet, on the 4th of March, was dissolved, and the deputies dispersed by
military force. Then at last the Slavonians saw that they were duped, and then
they shouted: "Let us go to Frankfort and carry on there the opposition which
we cannot pursue here!" But it was then too late, and the very fact that they
had no other alternative than either to remain quiet or to join the impotent
Frankfort Assembly, this fact alone was sufficient to show their utter
helplessness.</p>
<p>Thus ended for the present, and most likely for ever, the attempts of the
Slavonians of Germany to recover an independent national existence. Scattered
remnants of numerous nations, whose nationality and political vitality had long
been extinguished, and who in consequence had been obliged, for almost a
thousand years, to follow in the wake of a mightier nation, their conqueror,
the same as the Welsh in England, the Basques in Spain, the Bas-Bretons in
France, and at a more recent period the Spanish and French Creoles in those
portions of North America occupied of late by the Anglo-American
race—these dying nationalities, the Bohemians, Carinthians, Dalmatians,
etc., had tried to profit by the universal confusion of 1848, in order to
restore their political <i>status quo</i> of A. D. 800. The history of a
thousand years ought to have shown them that such a retrogression was
impossible; that if all the territory east of the Elbe and Saale had at one
time been occupied by kindred Slavonians, this fact merely proved the
historical tendency, and at the same time physical and intellectual power of
the German nation to subdue, absorb, and assimilate its ancient eastern
neighbors; that this tendency of absorption on the part of the Germans had
always been, and still was one of the mightiest means by which the civilization
of Western Europe had been spread in the east of that continent; that it could
only cease whenever the process of Germanization had reached the frontier of
large, compact, unbroken nations, capable of an independent national life, such
as the Hungarians, and in some degree the Poles: and that, therefore, the
natural and inevitable fate of these dying nations was to allow this process of
dissolution and absorption by their stronger neighbors to complete itself.
Certainly this is no very flattering prospect for the national ambition of the
Panslavistic dreamers who succeeded in agitating a portion of the Bohemian and
South Slavonian people; but can they expect that history would retrograde a
thousand years in order to please a few phthisical bodies of men, who in every
part of the territory they occupy are interspersed with and surrounded by
Germans, who from time almost immemorial have had for all purposes of
civilization no other language but the German, and who lack the very first
conditions of national existence, numbers and compactness of territory? Thus,
the Panslavistic rising, which everywhere in the German and Hungarian Slavonic
territories was the cloak for the restoration to independence of all these
numberless petty nations, everywhere clashed with the European revolutionary
movements, and the Slavonians, although pretending to fight for liberty, were
invariably (the Democratic portion of the Poles excepted) found on the side of
despotism and reaction. Thus it was in Germany, thus in Hungary, thus even here
and there in Turkey. Traitors to the popular cause, supporters and chief props
to the Austrian Government's cabal, they placed themselves in the position of
outlaws in the eyes of all revolutionary nations. And although nowhere the mass
of the people had a part in the petty squabbles about nationality raised by the
Panslavistic leaders, for the very reason that they were too ignorant, yet it
will never be forgotten that in Prague, in a half-German town, crowds of
Slavonian fanatics cheered and repeated the cry: "Rather the Prussian knout
than German Liberty!" After their first evaporated effort in 1848, and after
the lesson the Austrian Government gave them, it is not likely that another
attempt at a later opportunity will be made. But if they should try again under
similar pretexts to ally themselves to the counter-revolutionary force, the
duty of Germany is clear. No country in a state of revolution and involved in
external war can tolerate a Vendee in its very heart.</p>
<p>As to the Constitution proclaimed by the Emperor at the same time with the
dissolution of the Diet, there is no need to revert to it, as it never had a
practical existence, and is now done away with altogether. Absolutism has been
restored in Austria to all intents and purposes ever since the 4th March,
1849.</p>
<p>In Prussia, the Chambers met in February for the ratification and revision
of the new Charter proclaimed by the King. They sat for about six weeks, humble
and meek enough in their behavior toward the Government, yet not quite prepared
to go the lengths the King and his ministers wished them to go. Therefore, as
soon as a suitable occasion presented itself, they were dissolved.</p>
<p>Thus both Austria and Prussia had for the moment got rid of the shackles of
parliamentary control. The Governments now concentrated all power in
themselves, and could bring that power to bear wherever is was wanted: Austria
upon Hungary and Italy, Prussia upon Germany. For Prussia, too, was preparing
for a campaign by which "order" was to be restored in the smaller States.</p>
<p>Counter-revolution being now paramount in the two great centres of action in
Germany,—in Vienna and Berlin,—there remained only the lesser
States in which the struggle was still undecided, although the balance there,
too, was leaning more and more against the revolutionary interest. These
smaller States, we have said, found a common centre in the National Assembly at
Frankfort. Now, this so-called National Assembly, although its reactionist
spirit had long been evident, so much so that the very people of Frankfort had
risen in arms against it, yet its origin was of more or less revolutionary
nature; it occupied an abnormal, revolutionary position in January; its
competence had never been defined, and it had at last come to the
decision—which, however, was never recognized by the larger
States—that its resolutions had the force of law. Under these
circumstances, and when the Constitutionalist-Monarchial party saw their
positions turned by the recovering Absolutists, it is not to be wondered that
the Liberal, monarchical bourgeoisie of almost the whole of Germany should
place their last hopes upon the majority of this Assembly, just as the petty
shopkeepers in the rest, the nucleus of the Democratic party, gathered in their
growing distress around the minority of that same body, which indeed formed the
last compact Parliamentary phalanx of Democracy. On the other hand, the larger
Governments, and particularly the Prussian Ministry, saw more and more the
incompatibility of such an irregular elective body with the restored
monarchical system of Germany, and if they did not at once force its
dissolution, it was only because the time had not yet come, and because Prussia
hoped first to use it for the furthering of its own ambitious purposes.</p>
<p>In the meantime, that poor Assembly itself fell into a greater and greater
confusion. Its deputations and commissaries had been treated with the utmost
contempt, both in Vienna and Berlin; one of its members, in spite of his
parliamentary inviolability, had been executed in Vienna as a common rebel. Its
decrees were nowhere heeded; if they were noticed at all by the larger powers,
it was merely by protesting notes which disputed the authority of the Assembly
to pass laws and resolutions binding upon their Governments. The Representative
of the Assembly, the Central Executive power, was involved in diplomatic
squabbles with almost all the Cabinets of Germany, and, in spite of all their
efforts, neither Assembly nor Central Government could bring Austria and
Prussia to state their ultimate views, plans and demands. The Assembly, at
last, commenced to see clearly, at least so far, that it had allowed all power
to slip out of its hands, that it was at the mercy of Austria and Prussia, and
that if it intended making a Federal Constitution for Germany at all, it must
set about the thing at once and in good earnest. And many of the vacillating
members also saw clearly that they had been egregiously duped by the
Governments. But what were they, in their impotent position, able to do now?
The only thing that could have saved them would have been promptly and
decidedly to pass over into the popular camp; but the success, even of that
step, was more than doubtful; and then, where in this helpless crowd of
undecided, shortsighted, self-conceited beings, who, when the eternal noise of
contradictory rumors and diplomatic notes completely stunned them, sought their
only consolation and support in the everlastingly repeated assurance that they
were the best, the greatest, the wisest men of the country, and that they alone
could save Germany—where, we say, among these poor creatures, whom a
single year of Parliamentary life had turned into complete idiots, where were
the men for a prompt and decisive resolution, much less for energetic and
consistent action?</p>
<p>At last the Austrian Government threw off the mask. In its Constitution of
the 4th of March, it proclaimed Austria an indivisible monarchy, with common
finances, system of customs-duties, of military establishments, thereby
effacing every barrier and distinction between the German and non-German
provinces. This declaration was made in the face of resolutions and articles of
the intended Federal Constitution which had been already passed by the
Frankfort Assembly. It was the gauntlet of war thrown clown to it by Austria,
and the poor Assembly had no other choice but to take it up. This it did with a
deal of blustering, which Austria, in the consciousness of her power, and of
the utter nothingness of the Assembly, could well afford to allow to pass. And
this precious representation, as it styled itself, of the German people, in
order to revenge itself for this insult on the part of Austria, saw nothing
better before it than to throw itself, hands and feet tied, at the feet of the
Prussian Government. Incredible as it would seem, it bent its knees before the
very ministers whom it had condemned as unconstitutional and antipopular, and
whose dismissal it had in vain insisted upon. The details of this disgraceful
transaction, and the tragicomical events that followed, will form the subject
of our next.</p>

<p class="title">Revolution and Counter-revolution in Germany</p>
<h1>XVIII. <br>
Petty Traders</h1>
<h5>OCTOBER 2, 1852.</h5>
<p class="fst">IN OUR last we showed that the struggle between the German
Governments on the one side, and the Frankfort Parliament on the other, had
ultimately acquired such a degree of violence that in the first days of May, a
great portion of Germany broke out in open insurrection; first Dresden, then
the Bavarian Palatinate, parts of Rhenish Prussia, and at last Baden.</p>
<p>In all cases, the <i>real fighting</i> body of the insurgents, that body
which first took up arms and gave battle to the troops consisted of the
<i>working classes of the towns.</i> A portion of the poorer country
population, laborers and petty farmers, generally joined them after the
outbreak of the conflict. The greater number of the young men of all classes,
below the capitalist class, were to be found, for a time at least, in the ranks
of the insurgent armies, but this rather indiscriminate aggregate of young men
very soon thinned as the aspect of affairs took a somewhat serious turn. The
students particularly, those "representatives of intellect," as they liked to
call themselves, were the first to quit their standards, unless they were
retained by the bestowal of officer's rank, for which they, of course, had very
seldom any qualifications.</p>
<p>The working class entered upon this insurrection as they would have done
upon any other which promised either to remove some obstacles in their progress
towards political dominion and social revolution, or, at least, to tie the more
influential but less courageous classes of society to a more decided and
revolutionary course than they had followed hitherto. The working class took up
arms with a full knowledge that this was, in the direct bearings of the case,
no quarrel of its own; but it followed up its only true policy, to allow no
class that has risen on its shoulders (as the bourgeoisie had done in 1848) to
fortify its class-government, without opening, at least, a fair field to the
working classes for the struggle for its own interests, and, in any case, to
bring matters to a crisis, by which either the nation was fairly and
irresistibly launched in the revolutionary career, or else the <i>status
quo</i> before the Revolution restored as nearly as possible, and, thereby, a
new revolution rendered unavoidable. In both cases the working classes
represented the real and well-understood interest of the nation at large, in
hastening as much as possible that revolutionary course which for the old
societies of civilized Europe has now become a historical necessity, before any
of them can again aspire to a more quiet and regular development of their
resources.</p>
<p>As to country people that joined the insurrection, they were principally
thrown into the arms of the revolutionary party, partly by the relatively
enormous load of taxation, and partly of feudal burdens pressing upon them.</p>
<p>Without any initiative of their own, they formed the tail of the other
classes engaged in the insurrection, wavering between the working men on the
one side, and the petty trading class on the other. Their own private social
position, in almost every case, decided which way they turned; the agricultural
laborer generally supported the city artisan; the small farmer was apt to go
hand in hand with the small shopkeeper.</p>
<p>This class of petty tradesmen, the great importance and influence of which
we have already several times adverted to, may be considered as the leading
class of the insurrection of May, 1849. There being, this time, none of the
large towns of Germany among the center of the movement, the petty trading
class, which in middling and lesser towns always predominates, found the means
of getting the direction of the movement into its hands. We have, moreover,
seen that, in this struggle for the Imperial Constitution, and for the rights
of the German Parliament, there were the interests of this peculiar class at
stake. The Provisional Governments formed in all the insurgent districts
represented in the majority of each of them this section of the people, and the
length they went to may therefore be fairly taken as the measure of what the
German petty bourgeoisie is capable of—capable, as we shall see, of
nothing but ruining any movement that entrusts itself to its hands.</p>
<p>The petty bourgeoisie, great in boasting, is very impotent for action, and
very shy in risking anything. The mesquin <span class="context">[small-minded]
</span>character of its commercial transactions and its credit operations is
eminently apt to stamp its character with a want of energy and enterprise; it
is, then, to be expected that similar qualities will mark its political career.
Accordingly the petty bourgeoisie encouraged insurrection by big words, and
great boasting as to what it was going to do; it was eager to seize upon power
as soon as the insurrection, much against its will, had broken out; it used
this power to no other purpose but to destroy the effects of the insurrection.
Wherever an armed conflict had brought matters to a serious crisis, there the
shopkeepers stood aghast at the dangerous situation created for them; aghast at
the people who had taken their boasting appeals to arms in earnest; aghast at
the power thus thrust into their own hands; aghast, above all, at the
consequences for themselves, for their social positions, for their fortunes, of
the policy in which they were forced to engage themselves. Were they not
expected to risk "life and property," as they used to say, for the cause of the
insurrection? Were they not forced to take official positions in the
insurrection, whereby, in the case of defeat, they risked the loss of their
capital? And in case of victory, were they not sure to be immediately turned
out of office, and to see their entire policy subverted by the victorious
proletarians who formed the main body of their fighting army? Thus placed
between opposing dangers which surrounded them on every side, the petty
bourgeoisie knew not to turn its power to any other account than to let
everything take its chance, whereby, of course, there was lost what little
chance of success there might have been, and thus to ruin the insurrection
altogether. Its policy, or rather want of policy, everywhere was the same, and,
therefore, the insurrections of May, 1849, in all parts of Germany, are all cut
out to the same pattern.</p>
<p>In Dresden, the struggle was kept on for four days in the streets of the
town. The shopkeepers of Dresden, the "communal guard," not only did not fight,
but in many instances favored the proceedings of the troops against the
insurgents. These again consisted almost exclusively of working men from the
surrounding manufacturing districts. They found an able and cool-headed
commander in the Russian refugee Michael Bakunin, who afterwards was taken
prisoner, and now is confined in the dungeons of Munkacs, Hungary. The
intervention of numerous Prussian troops crushed this insurrection.</p>
<p>In Rhenish Prussia the actual fighting was of little importance. All the
large towns being fortresses commanded by citadels, there could be only
skirmishing on the part of the insurgents. As soon as a sufficient number of
troops had been drawn together, there was an end to armed opposition.</p>
<p>In the Palatinate and Baden, on the contrary, a rich, fruitful province and
an entire state fell into the hands of the insurrection. Money, arms, soldiers,
warlike stores, everything was ready for use. The soldiers of the regular army
themselves joined the insurgents; nay, in Baden, they were amongst the foremost
of them. The insurrections in Saxony and Rhenish Prussia sacrificed themselves
in order to gain time for the organization of the South German movement. Never
was there such a favorable position for a provincial and partial insurrection
as this. A revolution was expected in Paris; the Hungarians were at the gates
of Vienna; in all the central States of Germany, not only the people, but even
the troops, were strongly in favor of the insurrection, and only wanted an
opportunity to join it openly. And yet the movement, having once got into the
hands of the petty bourgeoisie, was ruined from its very beginning. The petty
bourgeois rulers, particularly of Baden—Herr Brentano at the head of
them—never forgot that by usurping the place and prerogatives of the
"lawful" sovereign, the Grand Duke, they were committing high treason. They sat
down in their ministerial armchairs with the consciousness of criminality in
their hearts. What can you expect of such cowards? They not only abandoned the
insurrection to its own uncentralized, and therefore ineffective, spontaneity,
they actually did everything in their power to take the sting out of the
movement, to unman, to destroy it. And they succeeded, thanks to the zealous
support of that deep class of politicians, the "Democratic" heroes of the petty
bourgeoisie, who actually thought they were "saving the country," while they
allowed themselves to be led by their noses by a few men of a sharper cast,
such as Brentano.</p>
<p>As to the fighting part of the business, never were military operations
carried on in a more slovenly, more stolid way than under the Baden
General-in-Chief Sigel, an ex-lieutenant of the regular army. Everything was
got into confusion, every good opportunity was lost, every precious moment was
loitered away with planning colossal, but impracticable projects, until, when
at last the talented Pole Mieroslawski, took up the command, the army was
disorganized, beaten, dispirited, badly provided for, opposed to an enemy four
times more numerous, and withal, he could do nothing more than fight, at
Waghäusel, a glorious though unsuccessful battle, carry out a clever retreat,
offer a last hopeless fight under the walls of Rastatt, and resign. As in every
insurrectionary war where armies are mixed of well-drilled soldiers and raw
levies, there was plenty of heroism, and plenty of unsoldierlike, often
unconceivable panic, in the revolutionary army; but, imperfect as it could not
but be, it had at least the satisfaction that four times its number were not
considered sufficient to put it to the rout, and that a hundred thousand
regular troops, in a campaign against twenty thousand insurgents, treated them,
militarily with as much respect as if they had to fight the Old Guard of
Napoleon.</p>
<p>In May the insurrection had broken out; by the middle of July, 1849, it was
entirely subdued, and the first German Revolution was closed.</p>

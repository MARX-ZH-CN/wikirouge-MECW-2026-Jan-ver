<p class="information">Marx was asked in the summer of 1851 by Charles Anderson
Dana, managing editor of the <i>New York Tribune</i>, to write a series of
articles on the German Revolution. Founded in 1842 by Horace Greeley, the
<i>Tribune</i> was the most influential paper in the United States at the
time. These articles were written by Engels at the request of Marx, who was
then busy with his economic studies and felt, besides, that he had not yet
attained fluency in English. Engels wrote the articles in Manchester, where he
was employed, and sent them on to Marx in London to be edited and dispatched to
New York. Thus, although Engels must be rightly considered their author, Marx
took a big part in the preparation, for in their almost daily correspondence
the chief points were discussed thoroughly between them. The articles appeared
under Marx's name, and it was not until much later, when the correspondence
between the two life-long collaborators became available, that the true
circumstances were revealed. The contributions to the <i>Tribune</i> thus
begun continued until 1862, and though Marx himself wrote most of the articles
after 1852, Engels continued to help his friend by writing for him important
articles on political and military affairs. When Marx's daughter, Eleanor,
wrote the preface to the 1896 edition she was still under the impression that
Marx had written the series.<br>

<!-- <hR class="section"> -->
<h1>VII. <br>
The Frankfort National Assembly.</h1>
<h5>FEBRUARY 27, 1852.</h5>
<p class="fst">IT will perhaps be in the recollection of our readers that in
the six preceding papers we followed up the revolutionary movement of Germany
to the two great popular victories of March 13th in Vienna, and March 18th in
Berlin. We saw, both in Austria and Prussia, the establishment of
constitutional governments and the proclamation, as leading rules for all
future policy, of Liberal, or middle class principles; and the only difference
observable between the two great centers of action was this, that in Prussia
the liberal bourgeoisie, in the persons of two wealthy merchants, Messrs.
Camphausen and Hansemann, directly seized upon the reins of power; while in
Austria, where the bourgeoisie was, politically, far less educated, the Liberal
bureaucracy walked into office, and professed to hold power in trust for them.
We have further seen, how the parties and classes of society, that were
heretofore all united in opposition to the old government, got divided among
themselves after the victory, or even during the struggle; and how that same
Liberal bourgeoisie that alone profited from the victory turned round
immediately upon its allies of yesterday, assumed a hostile attitude against
every class or party of a more advanced character, and concluded an alliance
with the conquered feudal and bureaucratic interests. It was in fact, evident,
even from the beginning of the revolutionary drama, that the Liberal
bourgeoisie could not hold its ground against the vanquished, but not
destroyed, feudal and bureaucratic parties except by relying upon the
assistance of the popular and more advanced parties; and that it equally
required, against the torrent of these more advanced masses, the assistance of
the feudal nobility and of the bureaucracy. Thus, it was clear enough that the
bourgeoisie in Austria and Prussia did not possess sufficient strength to
maintain their power, and to adapt the institutions of the country to their own
wants and ideas. The Liberal bourgeois ministry was only a halting-place from
which, according to the turn circumstances might take, the country would either
have to go on to the more advanced stage of Unitarian republicanism, or to
relapse into the old clerico-feudal and bureaucratic regime. At all events, the
real, decisive struggle was yet to come; the events of March had only engaged
the combat.</p>
<p>Austria and Prussia being the two ruling states of Germany, every decisive
revolutionary victory in Vienna or Berlin would have been decisive for all
Germany. And as far as they went, the events of March, 1848 in these two cities
decided the turn of German affairs. It would, then, be superfluous to recur to
the movements that occurred in the minor States; and we might, indeed, confine
ourselves to the consideration of Austrian and Prussian affairs exclusively, if
the existence of these minor states had not given rise to a body which was, by
its very existence, a most striking proof of the abnormal situation of Germany
and of the incompleteness of the late revolution: a body so abnormal, so
ludicrous by its very position, and yet so full of its own importance, that
history will, most likely, never afford a pendant to it. This body was the
so-called <i>German National Assembly</i> at Frankfort-on-Main.</p>
<p>After the popular victories of Vienna and Berlin, it was a matter of course
that there should be a Representative Assembly for all Germany. This body was
consequently elected, and met at Frankfort, by the side of the old Federative
Diet. The German National Assembly was expected, by the people, to settle every
matter in dispute, and to act as the highest legislative authority for the
whole of the German Confederation. But, at the same time, the Diet which had
convoked it had in no way fixed its attributions. No one knew whether its
decrees were to have force of law, or whether they were to be subject to the
sanction of the Diet, or of the individual Governments. In this perplexity, if
the Assembly had been possessed of the least energy, it would have immediately
dissolved and sent home the Diet— than which no corporate body was more
unpopular in Germany—and replaced it by a Federal Government, chosen from
among its own members. It would have declared itself the only legal expression
of the sovereign will of the German people, and thus have attached legal
validity to every one of its decrees. It would, above all, have secured to
itself an organized and armed force in the country sufficient to put down any
opposition on the parts of the Governments. And all this was easy, very easy,
at that early period of the Revolution. But that would have been expecting a
great deal too much from an Assembly composed in its majority of Liberal
attorneys and <i>doctrinaire</i> professors an Assembly which, while it
pretended to embody the very essence of German intellect and science, was in
reality nothing but a stage where old and worn-out political characters
exhibited their involuntary ludicrousness and their impotence of thought, as
well as action, before the eyes of all Germany. This Assembly of old women was,
from the first day of its existence, more frightened of the least popular
movement than of all the reactionary plots of all the German Governments put
together. It deliberated under the eyes of the Diet, nay, it almost craved the
Diet's sanction to its decrees, for its first resolutions had to be promulgated
by that odious body. Instead of asserting its own sovereignty, it studiously
avoided the discussion of any such dangerous question. Instead of surrounding
itself by a popular force, it passed to the order of the day over all the
violent encroachments of the Governments; Mayence <span class="context">[i.e.
Mainz]</span> , under its very eyes, was placed in a state of siege, and the
people there disarmed, and the National Assembly did not stir. Later on it
elected Archduke John of Austria Regent of Germany, and declared that all its
resolutions were to have the force of law; but then Archduke John was only
instituted in his new dignity after the consent of all the Governments had been
obtained, and he was instituted not by the Assembly, but by the Diet; and as to
the legal force of the decrees of the Assembly, that point was never recognized
by the larger Governments, nor enforced by the Assembly itself; it therefore
remained in suspense. Thus we had the strange spectacle of an Assembly
pretending to be the only legal representative of a great and sovereign nation,
and yet never possessing either the will or the force to make its claims
recognized. The debates of this body, without any practical result, were not
even of any theoretical value, reproducing, as they did, nothing but the most
hackneyed commonplace themes of superannuated philosophical and juridical
schools; every sentence that was said, or rather stammered forth, in that
Assembly having been printed a thousand times over, and a thousand times
better, long before.</p>
<p>Thus the pretended new central authority of Germany left everything as it
had found it. So far from realizing the long-demanded unity of Germany, it did
not dispossess the most insignificant of the princes who ruled her; it did not
draw closer the bonds of union between her separated provinces; it never moved
a single step to break down the customhouse barriers that separated Hanover
from Prussia, and Prussia from Austria; it did not even make the slightest
attempt to remove the obnoxious dues that everywhere obstruct river navigation
in Prussia. But the less this Assembly did the more it blustered. It created a
German fleet—upon paper; it annexed Poland and Schleswig; it allowed
German-Austria to carry on war against Italy, and yet prohibited the Italians
from following up the Austrians into their safe retreat in Germany; it gave
three cheers and one cheer more for the French republic, and it received
Hungarian embassies, which certainly went home with far more confused ideas
about Germany than they had come with.</p>
<p>This Assembly had been, in the beginning of the Revolution, the bugbear of
all German Governments. They had counted upon a very dictatorial and
revolutionary action on its part—-on account of the very want of
definiteness in which it had been found necessary to leave its competency.
These Governments, therefore, got up a most comprehensive system of intrigues
in order to weaken the influence of this dreaded body; but they proved to have
more luck than wits, for this Assembly did the work of the Governments better
than they themselves could have done. The chief feature among these intrigues
was the convocation of local Legislative Assemblies, and in consequence, not
only the lesser States convoked their legislatures, but Prussia and Austria
also called constituent assemblies. In these, as in the Frankfort House of
Representatives, the Liberal middle class, or its allies, liberal lawyers, and
bureaucrats had the majority, and the turn affairs took in each of them was
nearly the same. The only difference is this, that the German National Assembly
was the parliament of an imaginary country, as it had declined the task of
forming what nevertheless was its own first condition of existence, viz. a
United Germany; that it discussed the imaginary and never-to-be-carried-out
measures of an imaginary government of its own creation, and that it passed
imaginary resolutions for which nobody cared; while in Austria and Prussia the
constituent bodies were at least real parliaments, upsetting and creating real
ministries, and forcing, for a time at least, their resolutions upon the
princes with whom they had to contend. They, too, were cowardly, and lacked
enlarged views of revolutionary resolutions; they, too, betrayed the people,
and restored power to the hands of feudal, bureaucratic, and military
despotism. But then they were at least obliged to discuss practical questions
of immediate interest, and to live upon earth with other people, while the
Frankfort humbugs were never happier than when they could roam in "the airy
realms of dream," <i>im Luftreich des Traums.</i> <span class="context">[from
Heinrich Heine's <i>Aristophanes</i>]</span> Thus the proceedings of the
Berlin and Vienna Constituents form an important part of German revolutionary
history, while the lucubrations of the Frankfort collective tomfoolery merely
interest the collector of literary and antiquarian curiosities.</p>
<p>The people of Germany, deeply feeling the necessity of doing away with the
obnoxious territorial division that scattered and annihilated the collective
force of the nation, for some time expected to find, in the Frankfort National
Assembly at least, the beginning of a new era. But the childish conduct of that
set of wiseacres soon disenchanted the national enthusiasm. The disgraceful
proceedings occasioned by the armistice of Malmoe (September, 1848,) made the
popular indignation burst out against a body which, it had been hoped, would
give the nation a fair field for action, and which, instead, carried away by
unequalled cowardice, only restored to their former solidity the foundations
upon which the present counter-revolutionary system is built.</p>

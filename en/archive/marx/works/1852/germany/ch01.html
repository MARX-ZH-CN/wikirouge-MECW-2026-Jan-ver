<p class="title">Revolution and Counter-revolution in Germany</p>
<h1>I. <br>
Germany at the Outbreak of the Revolution.</h1>
<h5>OCTOBER 25, 1851.</h5>
<p class="fst">THE first act of the revolutionary drama on the continent of
Europe has closed. The "powers that were" before the hurricane of 1848 are
again the "powers that be," and the more or less popular rulers of a day,
provisional governors, triumvirs, dictators with their tail of representatives,
civil commissioners, military commissioners, prefects, judges, generals,
officers, and soldiers, are thrown upon foreign shores, and "transported beyond
the seas" to England or America, there to form new governments <i>in partibus
infidelium,</i> European committees, central committees, national committees,
and to announce their advent with proclamations quite as solemn as those of any
less imaginary potentates.</p>
<p>A more signal defeat than that undergone by the continental revolutionary
party—or rather parties—upon all points of the line of battle,
cannot be imagined. But what of that? Has not the struggle of the British
middle classes for their social and political supremacy embraced forty-eight,
that of the French middle classes forty years of unexampled struggles? And was
their triumph ever nearer than at the very moment when restored monarchy
thought itself more firmly settled than ever? The times of that superstition
which attributed revolutions to the ill-will of a few agitators have long
passed away. Everyone knows nowadays that wherever there is a revolutionary
convulsion, there must be some social want in the background, which is
prevented, by outworn institutions, from satisfying itself. The want may not
yet be felt as strongly, as generally, as might ensure immediate success; but
every attempt at forcible repression will only bring it forth stronger and
stronger, until it bursts its fetters. If, then, we have been beaten, we have
nothing else to do but to begin again from the beginning. And, fortunately, the
probably very short interval of rest which is allowed us between the close of
the first and the beginning of the second act of the movement, gives us time
for a very necessary piece of work: the study of the causes that necessitated
both the late outbreak and its defeat; causes that are not to be sought for in
the accidental efforts, talents, faults, errors, or treacheries of some of the
leaders, but in the general social state and conditions of existence of each of
the convulsed nations. That the sudden movements of February and March, 1848,
were not the work of single individuals, but spontaneous, irresistible
manifestations of national wants and necessities, more or less clearly
understood, but very distinctly felt by numerous classes in every country, is a
fact recognized everywhere; but when you inquire into the causes of the
counter-revolutionary successes, there you are met on every hand with the ready
reply that it was Mr. This or Citizen That who "betrayed" the people. Which
reply may be very true or not, according to circumstances, but under no
circumstances does it explain anything—not even show how it came to pass
that the "people" allowed themselves to be thus betrayed. And what a poor
chance stands a political party whose entire stock-in-trade consists in a
knowledge of the solitary fact that Citizen So-and-so is not to be trusted.</p>
<p>The inquiry into, and the exposition of, the causes, both of the
revolutionary convulsion and its suppression, are, besides, of paramount
importance from a historical point of view. All these petty, personal quarrels
and recriminations—all these contradictory assertions that it was
Marrast, or Ledru Rollin, or Louis Blanc, or any other member of the
Provisional Government, or the whole of them, that steered the Revolution
amidst the rocks upon which it foundered—of what interest can they be,
what light can they afford, to the American or Englishman who observed all
these various movements from a distance too great to allow of his
distinguishing any of the details of operations? No man in his senses will ever
believe that eleven men, mostly of very indifferent capacity either for good or
evil, were able in three months to ruin a nation of thirty-six millions, unless
those thirty-six millions saw as little of their way before them as the eleven
did. But how it came to pass that thirty-six millions were at once called upon
to decide for themselves which way to go, although partly groping in dim
twilight, and how then they got lost and their old leaders were for a moment
allowed to return to their leadership, that is just the question.</p>
<p>If, then, we try to lay before the readers of <i>The Tribune</i> the
causes which, while they necessitated the German Revolution of 1848, led quite
as inevitably to its momentary repression in 1849 and 1850, we shall not be
expected to give a complete history of events as they passed in that country.
Later events, and the judgment of coming generations, will decide what portion
of that confused mass of seemingly accidental, incoherent, and incongruous
facts is to form a part of the world's history. The time for such a task has
not yet arrived; we must confine ourselves to the limits of the possible, and
be satisfied, if we can find rational causes, based upon undeniable facts, to
explain the chief events, the principal vicissitudes of that movement, and to
give us a clue as to the direction which the next, and perhaps not very
distant, outbreak will impart to the German people.</p>
<p>And firstly, what was the state of Germany at the outbreak of the
Revolution?</p>
<p>The composition of the different classes of the people which form the
groundwork of every political organization was, in Germany, more complicated
than in any other country. While in England and France feudalism was entirely
destroyed, or, at least, reduced, as in the former country, to a few
insignificant forms, by a powerful and wealthy middle class, concentrated in
large towns, and particularly in the capital, the feudal nobility in Germany
had retained a great portion of their ancient privileges. The feudal system of
tenure was prevalent almost everywhere. The lords of the land had even retained
the jurisdiction over their tenants. Deprived of their political privileges, of
the right to control the princes, they had preserved almost all their Medieval
supremacy over the peasantry of their demesnes, as well as their exemption from
taxes. Feudalism was more flourishing in some localities than in others, but
nowhere except on the left bank of the Rhine was it entirely destroyed. This
feudal nobility, then extremely numerous and partly very wealthy was
considered, officially, the first "Order" in the country. It furnished the
higher Government officials, it almost exclusively officered the army.</p>
<p>The bourgeoisie of Germany was by far not as wealthy and concentrated as
that of France or England. The ancient manufactures of Germany had been
destroyed by the introduction of steam, and the rapidly extending supremacy of
English manufactures; the more modern manufactures, started under the
Napoleonic continental system, established in other parts of the country, did
not compensate for the loss of the old ones, nor suffice to create a
manufacturing interest strong enough to force its wants upon the notice of
governments jealous of every extension of non-noble wealth and power. If France
carried her silk manufactures victorious through fifty years of revolutions and
wars Germany, during the same time, all but lost her ancient linen trade. The
manufacturing districts, besides, were few and far between; situated far
inland, and using, mostly, foreign, Dutch, or Belgian ports for their imports
and exports, they had little or no interest in common with the large seaport
towns on the North Sea and the Baltic; they were, above all, unable to create
large manufacturing and trading centres, such as Paris and Lyons, London and
Manchester. The causes of this backwardness of German manufactures were
manifold, but two will suffice to account for it: the unfavorable geographical
situation of the country, at a distance from the Atlantic, which had become the
great highway for the world's trade, and the continuous wars in which Germany
was involved, and which were fought on her soil, from the sixteenth century to
the present day. It was this want of numbers, and particularly of anything like
concentrated numbers, which prevented the German middle classes from attaining
that political supremacy which the English bourgeoisie has enjoyed ever since
1688, and which the French conquered in 1789. And yet, ever since 1815, the
wealth, and with the wealth the political importance of the middle class in
Germany, was continually growing. Governments were, although reluctantly,
compelled to bow, at least to its more immediate material interests. It may
even be truly said that from 1815 to 1830, and from 1832 to 1840 every particle
of political influence, which, having been allowed to the middle class in the
constitutions of the smaller States, was again wrested from them during the
above two periods of political reaction, that every such particle was
compensated for by some more practical advantage allowed to them. Every
political defeat of the middle class drew after it a victory on the field of
commercial legislation. And certainly, the Prussian Protective Tariff of 1818,
and the formation of the Zollverein, were worth a good deal more to the traders
and manufacturers of Germany than the equivocal right of expressing in the
chambers of some diminutive dukedom their want of confidence in ministers who
laughed at their votes. Thus, with growing wealth and extending trade, the
bourgeoisie soon arrived at a stage where it found the development of its most
important interests checked by the political constitution of the country; by
its random division among thirty-six princes with conflicting tendencies and
caprices; by the feudal fetters upon agriculture and the trade connected with
it; by the prying superintendence to which an ignorant and presumptuous
bureaucracy subjected all its transactions. At the same time the extension and
consolidation of the Zollverein, the general introduction of steam
communication, the growing competition in the home trade, brought the
commercial classes of the different States and Provinces closer together,
equalized their interests and centralized their strength. The natural
consequence was the passing of the whole mass of them into the camp of the
Liberal Opposition, and the gaining of the first serious struggle of the German
middle class for political power. This change may be dated from 1840, from the
moment when the bourgeoisie of Prussia assumed the lead of the middle class
movement of Germany. We shall hereafter revert to this Liberal Opposition
movement of 1840-1847.</p>
<p>The great mass of the nation, which neither belonged to the nobility nor to
the bourgeoisie, consisted in the towns of the small trading and shopkeeping
class and the working people, and in the country of the peasantry.</p>
<p>The small trading and shopkeeping class is exceedingly numerous in Germany,
in consequence of the stinted development which the large capitalists and
manufacturers as a class have had in that country. In the larger towns it forms
almost the majority of the inhabitants; in the smaller ones it entirely
predominates, from the absence of wealthier competitors or influence. This
class, a most important one in every modern body politic, and in all modern
revolutions, is still more important in Germany, where, during the recent
struggles, it generally played the decisive part. Its intermediate position
between the class of larger capitalists, traders, and manufacturers, the
bourgeoisie properly so-called, and the proletarian or industrial class,
determines its character. Aspiring to the position of the first, the least
adverse turn of fortune hurls the individuals of this class down into the ranks
of the second. In monarchical and feudal countries the custom of the court and
aristocracy becomes necessary to its existence; the loss of this custom might
ruin a great part of it. In the smaller towns a military garrison, a county
government, a court of law with its followers, form very often the base of its
prosperity; withdraw these, and down go the shopkeepers, the tailors, the
shoemakers, the joiners. Thus eternally tossed about between the hope of
entering the ranks of the wealthier class, and the fear of being reduced to the
state of proletarians or even paupers; between the hope of promoting their
interests by conquering a share in the direction of public affairs, and the
dread of rousing, by ill-timed opposition, the ire of a government which
disposes of their very existence, because it has the power of removing their
best customers; possessed of small means, the insecurity of the possession of
which is in the inverse ratio of the amount,—this class is extremely
vacillating in its views. Humble and crouchingly submissive under a powerful
feudal or monarchical Government, it turns to the side of Liberalism when the
middle class is in the ascendant; it becomes seized with violent democratic
fits as soon as the middle class has secured its own supremacy, but falls back
into the abject despondency of fear as soon as the class below itself, the
proletarians, attempts an independent movement. We shall by and by see this
class, in Germany, pass alternately from one of these stages to the other.</p>
<p>The working class in Germany is, in its social and political development, as
far behind that of England and France as the German bourgeoisie is behind the
bourgeoisie of those countries. Like master, like man. The evolution of the
conditions of existence for a numerous, strong, concentrated, and intelligent
proletarian class goes hand in hand with the development of the conditions of
existence for a numerous, wealthy, concentrated, and powerful middle class. The
working class movement itself never is independent, never is of an exclusively
proletarian character until all the different factions of the middle class, and
particularly its most progressive faction, the large manufacturers, have
conquered political power, and remodelled the State according to their wants.
It is then that the inevitable conflict between the employer and the employed
becomes imminent, and cannot be adjourned any longer; that the working class
can no longer be put off with delusive hopes and promises never to be realized;
that the great problem of the nineteenth century, the abolition of the
proletariat, is at last brought forward fairly and in its proper light. Now, in
Germany the mass of the working class were employed, not by those modern
manufacturing lords of which Great Britain furnishes such splendid specimens,
but by small tradesmen, whose entire manufacturing system is a mere relic of
the Middle Ages. And as there is an enormous difference between the great
cotton lord and the petty cobbler or master tailor, so there is a corresponding
distance from the wide-awake factory operative of modern manufacturing Babylons
to the bashful journeyman tailor or cabinetmaker of a small country town, who
lives in circumstances and works after a plan very little different from those
of the like sort of men some five hundred years ago. This general absence of
modern conditions of life, of modern modes of industrial production, of course
was accompanied by a pretty equally general absence of modern ideas, and it is,
therefore, not to be wondered at if, at the outbreak of the Revolution, a large
part of the working classes should cry out for the immediate re-establishment
of guilds and Mediaeval privileged trades' corporations. Yet from the
manufacturing districts, where the modern system of production predominated,
and in consequence of the facilities of inter-communication and mental
development afforded by the migratory life of a large number of the working
men, a strong nucleus formed itself, whose ideas about the emancipation of
their class were far clearer and more in accordance with existing facts and
historical necessities; but they were a mere minority. If the active movement
of the middle class may be dated from 1840, that of the working class commences
its advent by the insurrections of the Silesian and Bohemian factory operatives
in 1844, and we shall soon have occasion to pass in review the different stages
through which this movement passed.</p>
<p>Lastly, there was the great class of the small farmers, the peasantry, which
with its appendix of farm laborers, constitutes a considerable majority of the
entire nation. Rut this class again sub-divided itself into different
fractions. There were, firstly, the more wealthy farmers, what is called in
Germany <i>Gross </i>and <i>Mittel-Bauern,</i> proprietors of more or less
extensive farms, and each of them commanding the services of several
agricultural laborers. This class, placed between the large untaxed feudal
landowners, and the smaller peasantry and farm laborers, for obvious reasons
found in an alliance with the antifeudal middle class of the towns its most
natural political course. Then there were, secondly, the small freeholders,
predominating in the Rhine country, where feudalism had succumbed before the
mighty strokes of the great French Revolution. Similar independent small
freeholders also existed here and there in other provinces, where they had
succeeded in buying off the feudal charges formerly due upon their lands. This
class, however, was a class of freeholders by name only, their property being
generally mortgaged to such an extent, and under such onerous conditions, that
not the peasant, but the usurer who had advanced the money, was the real
landowner. Thirdly, the feudal tenants, who could not be easily turned out of
their holdings, but who had to pay a perpetual rent, or to perform in
perpetuity a certain amount of labor in favor of the lord of the manor. Lastly,
the agricultural laborers, whose condition, in many large farming concerns was
exactly that of the same class in England, and who in all cases lived and died
poor, ill-fed, and the slaves of their employers. These three latter classes of
the agricultural population, the small freeholders, the feudal tenants, and the
agricultural laborers, never troubled their heads much about politics before
the Revolution, but it is evident that this event must have opened to them a
new career, full of brilliant prospects. To every one of them the Revolution
offered advantages, and the movement once fairly engaged in, it was to be
expected that each, in their turn, would join it. But at the same time it is
quite as evident, and equally borne out by the history of all modern countries,
that the agricultural population, in consequence of its dispersion over a great
space, and of the difficulty of bringing about an agreement among any
considerable portion of it, never can attempt a successful independent
movement; they require the initiatory impulse of the more concentrated, more
enlightened, more easily moved people of the towns.</p>
<p>The preceeding short sketch of the most important of the classes, which in
their aggregate formed the German nation at the outbreak of the recent
movements, will already be sufficient to explain a great part of the
incoherence, incongruence, and apparent contradiction which prevailed in that
movement. When interests so varied, so conflicting, so strangely crossing each
other, are brought into violent collision; when these contending interests in
every district, every province, are mixed in different proportions; when, above
all, there is no great centre in the country, no London, no Paris, the
decisions of which. by their weight, may supersede the necessity of fighting
out the same quarrel over and over again in every single locality; what else is
to be expected but that the contest will dissolve itself into a mass of
unconnected struggles, in which an enormous quantity of blood, energy, and
capital is spent, but which for all that remain without any decisive
results?</p>
<p>The political dismemberment of Germany into three dozen of more or less
important principalities is equally explained by this confusion and
multiplicity of the elements which compose the nation. and which again vary in
every locality. Where there are no common interests there can be no unity of
purpose, much less of action. The German confederation, it is true, was
declared everlastingly indissoluble; yet the Confederation, and its organ, the
Diet, never represented German unity. The very highest pitch to which
centralization was ever carried in Germany was the establishment of the
Zollverein; by this the States on the North Sea were also forced into a Customs
Union of their own, Austria remaining wrapped up in her separate prohibitive
tariff. Germany had the satisfaction to be, for all practical purposes divided
between three independent powers only, instead of between thirty-six. Of course
the paramount supremacy of the Russian Czar, as established in 1814, underwent
no change on this account.</p>
<p>Having drawn these preliminary conclusions from our premises, we shall see,
in our next, how the aforesaid various classes of the German people were set
into movement one after the other, and what character the movement assumed on
the outbreak of the French Revolution of 1848.</p>

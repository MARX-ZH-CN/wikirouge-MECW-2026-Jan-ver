<p class="title">Revolution and Counter-revolution in Germany</p>
<h1>XVII. <br>
Insurrection</h1>
<h5>SEPTEMBER 18, 1852.</h5>
<p class="fst">THE inevitable conflict between the National Assembly of
Frankfort and the States Governments of Germany at last broke out in open
hostilities during the first days of May, 1849. The Austrian deputies, recalled
by their Government, had already left the Assembly and returned home, with the
exception of a few members of the Left or Democratic party. The great body of
the Conservative members, aware of the turn things were about to take, withdrew
even before they were called upon to do so by their respective Governments.
Thus, even independently of the causes which in the foregoing letters have been
shown to strengthen the influence of the Left, the mere desertion of their
posts by the members of the Right, sufficed to turn the old minority into a
majority of the Assembly. The new majority, which, at no former time, had
dreamed of ever obtaining that good fortune, had profited by their places on
the opposition benches to spout against the weakness, the indecision, the
indolence of the old majority, and of its Imperial Lieutenancy. Now all at
once, <i>they</i> were called on to replace that old majority. <i>They</i>
were now to show what they could perform. Of course, their career was to be one
of energy, determination, activity. <i>They,</i> the <i>elite</i> of
Germany, would soon be able to drive onwards the senile Lieutenant of the
Empire, and his vacillating ministers, and in case that was impossible they
would—there could be no doubt about it—by force of the sovereign
right of the people, depose that impotent Government, and replace it by an
energetic, indefatigable Executive, who would assure the salvation of Germany.
Poor fellows! <i>Their</i> rule—if rule it can be named, where no one
obeyed—was a still more ridiculous affair than even the rule of their
predecessors.</p>
<p>The new majority declared that, in spite of all obstacles, the Imperial
Constitution must be carried out, and at once; that on the 15th of July
ensuing, the people were to elect the deputies of the new House of
Representatives, and that this House was to meet at Frankfort on the 15th of
August following. Now, this was an open declaration of war against those
Governments that had not recognized the Imperial Constitution, the foremost
among which were Prussia, Austria, Bavaria, comprising more than three-fourths
of the German population; a declaration of war which was speedily accepted by
them. Prussia and Bavaria, too, recalled the deputies sent from their
territories to Frankfort, and hastened their military preparations against the
National Assembly, while, on the other hand, the demonstrations of the
Democratic party (out of Parliament) in favor of the Imperial Constitution and
of the National Assembly, acquired a more turbulent and violent character, and
the mass of the working people, led by the men of the most extreme party, were
ready to take up arms in a cause which, if it was not their own, at least gave
them a chance of somewhat approaching their aims by clearing Germany of its old
monarchical encumbrances. Thus everywhere the people and the Governments were
at daggers drawn upon this subject; the outbreak was inevitable; the mine was
charged, and it only wanted a spark to make it explode. The dissolution of the
Chambers in Saxony, the calling in of the Landwehr (military reserve) in
Prussia, the open resistance of the Government to the Imperial Constitution,
were such sparks; they fell, and all at once the country was in a blaze. In
Dresden, on the 4th of May, the people victoriously took possession of the
town, and drove out the King, while all the surrounding districts sent
re-inforcements to the insurgents. In Rhenish Prussia and Westphalia the
Landwehr refused to march, took possession of the arsenals, and armed itself in
defence of the Imperial Constitution. In the Palatinate the people seized the
Bavarian Government officials, and the public moneys, and instituted a
Committee of Defence, which placed the province under the protection of the
National Assembly. In Wurtemberg the people forced the King to acknowledge the
Imperial Constitution, and in Baden the army, united with the people, forced
the Grand Duke to flight, and erected a Provincial Government. In other parts
of Germany the people only awaited a decisive signal from the National Assembly
to rise in arms and place themselves at its disposal.</p>
<p>The position of the National Assembly was far more favorable than could have
been expected after its ignoble career. The western half of Germany had taken
up arms in its behalf; the military everywhere were vacillating; in the lesser
States they were undoubtedly favorable to the movement. Austria was prostrated
by the victorious advance of the Hungarians, and Russia, that reserve force of
the German Governments, was straining all its powers in order to support
Austria against the Magyar armies. There was only Prussia to subdue, and with
the revolutionary sympathies existing in that country, a chance certainly
existed of attaining that end. Everything then depended upon the conduct of the
Assembly.</p>
<p>Now, insurrection is an art quite as much as war or any other, and subject
to certain rules of proceeding, which, when neglected, will produce the ruin of
the party neglecting them. Those rules, logical deductions from the nature of
the parties and the circumstances one has to deal with in such a case, are so
plain and simple that the short experience of 1848 had made the Germans pretty
well acquainted with them. Firstly, never play with insurrection unless you are
fully prepared to face the consequences of your play. Insurrection is a
calculus with very indefinite magnitudes, the value of which may change every
day; the forces opposed to you have all the advantage of organization,
discipline, and habitual authority: unless you bring strong odds against them
you are defeated and ruined. Secondly, the insurrectionary career once entered
upon, act with the greatest determination, and on the offensive. The defensive
is the death of every armed rising; it is lost before it measures itself with
its enemies. Surprise your antagonists while their forces are scattering,
prepare new successes, however small, but daily; keep up the moral ascendancy
which the first successful rising has given to you; rally those vacillating
elements to your side which always follow the strongest impulse, and which
always look out for the safer side; force your enemies to a retreat before they
can collect their strength against you; in the words of Danton, the greatest
master of revolutionary policy yet known, <i>de l'audace, de l'audace, encore
de l'audace!</i></p>
<p>What, then, was the National Assembly of Frankfort to do if it would escape
the certain ruin which it was threatened with? First of all, to see clearly
through the situation, and to convince itself that there was now no other
choice than either to submit to the Governments unconditionally, or take up the
cause of the armed insurrection without reserve or hesitation. Secondly, to
publicly recognize all the insurrections that had already broken out, and to
call the people to take up arms everywhere in defence of the national
representation, outlawing all princes, ministers and others who should dare to
oppose the sovereign people represented by its mandatories. Thirdly, to at once
depose the German Imperial Lieutenant, to create a strong, active, unscrupulous
Executive, to call insurgent troops to Frankfort for its immediate protection,
thus offering at the same time a legal pretext for the spread of the
insurrection, to organize into a compact body all the forces at its disposal,
and, in short, to profit quickly and unhesitatingly by every available means
for strengthening its position and impairing that of its opponents.</p>
<p>Of all this the virtuous Democrats in the Frankfort Assembly did just the
contrary. Not content with letting things take the course they liked, these
worthies went so far as to suppress by their opposition all insurrectionary
movements which were preparing. Thus, for instance, did Herr Karl Vogt at
Nuremberg. They allowed the insurrections of Saxony, of Rhenish Prussia, of
Westphalia to be suppressed without any other help than a posthumous,
sentimental protest against the unfeeling violence of the Prussian Government.
They kept up an underhand diplomatic intercourse with the South German
insurrections but never gave them the support of their open acknowledgment.
They knew that the Lieutenant of the Empire sided with the Governments, and yet
they called upon <i>him,</i> who never stirred, to oppose the intrigues of
these Governments. The ministers of the Empire, old Conservatives, ridiculed
this impotent Assembly in every sitting, and they suffered it. And when William
Wolff, <a href="#1" id="a1"><span class="NOTE"><sup class="enote">[1]</sup></span></a> a Silesian deputy and one of the editors of
the <i>New Rhenish Gazette,</i> called upon them to outlaw the Lieutenant of
the Empire—who was, he justly said, nothing but the first and greatest
traitor to the Empire, he was hooted down by the unanimous and virtuous
indignation of those Democratic Revolutionists! In short, they went on talking,
protesting, proclaiming, pronouncing, but never had the courage or the sense to
act; while the hostile troops of the Governments drew nearer and nearer, and
their own Executive, the Lieutenant of the Empire, was busily plotting with the
German princes their speedy destruction. Thus even the last vestige of
consideration was lost to this contemptible Assembly; the insurgents who had
risen to defend it ceased to care any more for it, and when at last it came to
a shameful end, as we shall see, it died without anybody taking any notice of
its unhonored exit.</p>

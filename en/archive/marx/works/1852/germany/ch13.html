<p class="title">Revolution and Counter-revolution in Germany</p>
<h1>XIII. <br>
The Prussian Assembly—The National Assembly</h1>
<h5>APRIL 17th, 1852.</h5>
<p class="fst">ON the 1st of November Vienna fell, and on the 9th of the same
month the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly in Berlin showed how much
this event had at once raised the spirit and the strength of the
Counter-Revolutionary party all over Germany.</p>
<p>The events of the summer of 1848 in Prussia are soon told. The Constituent
Assembly, or rather "the Assembly elected for the purpose of agreeing upon a
Constitution with the Crown," and its majority of representatives of the middle
class interest, had long since forfeited all public esteem by lending itself to
all the intrigues of the Court, from fear of the more energetic elements of the
population. They had confirmed, or rather restored, the obnoxious privileges of
feudalism, and thus betrayed the liberty and the interests of, the peasantry.
They had neither been able to draw up a Constitution, nor to amend in any way
the general legislation. They had occupied themselves almost exclusively with
nice theoretical distinctions, mere formalities, and questions of
constitutional etiquette. The Assembly, in fact, was more a school of
Parliamentary <i>savoir vivre</i> for its members, than a body in which the
people could take any interest. The majorities were, besides, very nicely
balanced, and almost always decided by the wavering centers whose oscillations
from right to left, and <i>vice versa,</i> upset, first the ministry of
Camphausen, then that of Auerswald and Hansemann. But while thus the Liberals,
here as everywhere else, let the occasion slip out of their hands, the Court
reorganized its elements of strength among the nobility, and the most
uncultivated portion of the rural population, as well as in the army and the
bureaucracy. After Hansemann's downfall, a ministry of bureaucrats and military
officers, all staunch reactionists, was formed, which, however, seemingly gave
way to the demands of the Parliament; and the Assembly acting upon the
commodious principle of "measures, not men," were actually duped into
applauding this ministry, while they, of course, had no eyes for the
concentration and organization of Counter-Revolutionary forces, which that same
ministry carried on pretty openly. At last, the signal being given by the fall
of Vienna, the King dismissed its ministers, and replaced them by "men of
action," under the leadership of the present premier, Manteufel. Then the
dreaming Assembly at once awoke to the danger; it passed a vote of no
confidence in the Cabinet, which was at once replied to by a decree removing
the Assembly from Berlin, where it might, in case of a conflict, count upon the
support of the masses, to Brandenburg, a petty provincial town dependent
entirely upon the Government. The Assembly, however, declared that it could not
be adjourned, removed or dissolved, except with its own consent. In the
meantime, General Wrangle entered Berlin at the head of some forty thousand
troops. In a meeting of the municipal magistrates and the officers of the
National Guard, it was resolved not to offer any resistance. And now, after the
Assembly and its Constituents, the Liberal bourgeoisie, had allowed the
combined reactionary party to occupy every important position, and to wrest
from their hands almost every means of defence, began that grand comedy of
"passive and legal resistance" which they intended to be a glorious imitation
of the example of Hampden <span class="context"> [John Hampden, Member of Parliament and central figure of the English Revolution]</span>, and of the first efforts of the Americans in the War
of Independence. Berlin was declared in a state of siege, and Berlin remained
tranquil; the National Guard was dissolved by the Government, and its arms were
delivered up with the greatest punctuality. The Assembly was hunted down during
a fortnight, from one place of meeting to another, and everywhere dispersed by
the military, and the members of the Assembly begged of the citizens to remain
tranquil. At last the Government having declared the Assembly dissolved, it
passed a resolution to declare the levying of taxes illegal, and then its
members dispersed themselves over the country to organize the refusal of taxes.
But they found that they had been woefully mistaken in the choice of their
means. After a few agitated weeks, followed by severe measures of the
Government against the Opposition, everyone gave up the idea of refusing the
taxes in order to please a defunct Assembly that had not even had the courage
to defend itself.</p>
<p>Whether it was in the beginning of November, 1848, already too late to try
armed resistance, or whether a part of the army, on finding serious opposition,
would have turned over to the side of the Assembly, and thus decided the matter
in its favor, is a question which may never be solved. But in revolution as in
war, it is always necessary to show a strong front, and he who attacks is in
the advantage; and in revolution as in war, it is of the highest necessity to
stake everything on the decisive moment, whatever the odds may be. There is not
a single successful revolution in history that does not prove the truth of
these axioms. Now, for the Prussian Revolution, the decisive moment had come in
November, 1848; the Assembly, at the head, officially, of the whole
revolutionary interest, did neither show a strong front, for it receded at
every advance of the enemy; much less did it attack, for it chose even not to
defend itself; and when the decisive moment came, when Wrangle, at the head of
forty thousand men, knocked at the gates of Berlin, instead of finding, as he
and all his officers fully expected, every street studded with barricades,
every window turned into a loophole, he found the Gates open, and the streets
obstructed only by peaceful Berliner burghers, enjoying the joke they had
played upon him, by delivering themselves up, hands and feet tied, unto the
astonished soldiers. It is true, the Assembly and the people, if they had
resisted, might have been beaten; Berlin might have been bombarded, and many
hundreds might have been killed, without preventing the ultimate victory of the
Royalist party. But that was no reason why they should surrender their arms at
once. A well-contested defeat is a fact of as much revolutionary importance as
an easily-won victory. The defeats of Paris in June, 1848, and of Vienna in
October, certainly did far more in revolutionizing the minds of the people of
these two cities than the victories of February and March. The Assembly and the
people of Berlin would, probably have shared the fate of the two towns
above-named; but they would have fallen gloriously, and would have left behind
themselves, in the minds of the survivors, a wish of revenge which in
revolutionary times is one of the highest incentives to energetic and
passionate action. It is a matter of course that, in every struggle, he who
takes up the gauntlet risks being beaten; but is that a reason why he should
confess himself beaten, and submit to the yoke without drawing the sword?</p>
<p>In a revolution he who commands a decisive position and surrenders it,
instead of forcing the enemy to try his hands at an assault, invariably
deserves to be treated as a traitor.</p>
<p>The same decree of the King of Prussia which dissolved the Constituent
Assembly also proclaimed a new Constitution, founded upon the draft which had
been made by a Committee of that Assembly, but enlarging in some points the
powers of the Crown, and rendering doubtful in others those of the Parliament.
This Constitution established two Chambers, which were to meet soon for the
purpose of confirming and revising it.</p>
<p>We need hardly ask where the German National Assembly was during the "legal
and peaceful" struggle of the Prussian Constitutionalists. It was, as usual, at
Frankfort, occupied with passing very tame resolutions against the proceedings
of the Prussian Government, and admiring the "imposing spectacle of the
passive, legal, and unanimous resistance of a whole people against brutal
force." The Central Government sent commissioners to Berlin to intercede
between the Ministry and the Assembly; but they met the same fate as their
predecessors at Olmütz, and were politely shown out. The Left of the National
Assembly, i. e., the so-called Radical party, sent also their commissioners;
but after having duly convinced themselves of the utter helplessness of the
Berlin Assembly, and confessed their own equal helplessness, they returned to
Frankfort to report progress, and to testify to the admirably peaceful conduct
of the population of Berlin. Nay, more; when Herr Bassermann, one of the
Central Government's commissioners, reported that the late stringent measures
of the Prussian ministers were not without foundation, inasmuch as there had of
late been seen loitering about the streets of Berlin sundry, savage-looking
characters, such as always appear previous to anarchical movements (and which
ever since have been named "Bassermannic characters"), these worthy deputies of
the Left and energetic representatives of the revolutionary interest actually
arose to make oath, and testify that such was not the case! Thus within two
months the total impotency of the Frankfort Assembly was signally proved. There
could be no more glaring proofs that this body was totally inadequate to its
task; nay, that it had not even the remotest idea of what its task really was.
The fact that both in Vienna and in Berlin the fate of the Revolution was
settled, that in both these capitals the most important and vital questions
were disposed of, without the existence of the Frankfort Assembly ever being
taken the slightest notice of—this fact alone is sufficient to establish
that the body in question was a mere debating-club, composed of a set of dupes,
who allowed the Governments to use them as Parliamentary puppet, shown to amuse
the shopkeepers and petty tradesmen of petty States and petty towns, as long as
it was considered convenient to divert the attention of these parties. How long
this was considered convenient we shall soon see. But it is a fact worthy of
attention that among all the "eminent" men of this Assembly there was not one
who had the slightest apprehension of the part they were made to perform, and
that even up to the present day ex-members of the Frankfort Club have
invariably organs of historical perception quite peculiar to themselves.</p>

<p class="title">Revolution and Counter-revolution in Germany</p>
<h1>XIX. <br>
The Close of the Insurrection</h1>
<h5>OCTOBER 23, 1852.</h5>
<p class="fst">WHILE the south and west of Germany was in open insurrection,
and while it took the Governments from the first opening of hostilities at
Dresden to the capitulation of Rastatt, rather more than ten weeks, to stifle
this final blazing up of the first German Revolution, the National Assembly
disappeared from the political theater without any notice being taken of its
exit.</p>
<p>We left this august body at Frankfort, perplexed by the insolent attacks of
the Governments upon its dignity, by the impotency and treacherous listlessness
of the Central Power it had itself created, by the risings of the petty trading
class for its defence, and of the working class for a more revolutionary
ultimate end. Desolation and despair reigned supreme among its members; events
had at once assumed such a definite and decisive shape that in a few days the
illusions of these learned legislators as to their real power and influence
were entirely broken down. The Conservatives, at the signal given by the
Governments, had already retired from a body which, henceforth, could not exist
any longer, except in defiance of the constituted authorities. The Liberals
gave the matter up in utter discomfiture; they, too, threw up their commissions
as representatives. Honorable gentlemen decamped by hundreds. From eight or
nine hundred members the number had dwindled down so rapidly that now one
hundred and fifty, and a few days after one hundred, were declared a quorum.
And even these were difficult to muster, although the whole of the Democratic
party remained.</p>
<p>The course to be followed by the remnants of a parliament was plain enough.
They had only to take their stand openly and decidedly with the insurrection,
to give it, thereby, whatever strength legality could confer upon it, while
they themselves at once acquired an army for their own defence. They had to
summon the Central Power to stop all hostilities at once; and if, as could be
foreseen, this power neither could nor would do so, to depose it at once and
put another more energetic Government in its place. If insurgent troops could
not be brought to Frankfort (which, in the beginning, when the State
Governments were little prepared and still hesitating, might have been easily
done), then the Assembly could have adjourned at once to the very center of the
insurgent district. All this done at once, and resolutely, not later than the
middle or end of May, might have opened chances both for the insurrection and
for the National Assembly.</p>
<p>But such a determined course was not to be expected from the representatives
of German shopocracy. These aspiring statesmen were not at all freed from their
illusions. Those members who had lost their fatal belief in the strength and
inviolability of the Parliament had already taken to their heels; the Democrats
who remained, were not so easily induced to give up dreams of power and
greatness which they had cherished for a twelvemonth. True to the course they
had hitherto pursued, they shrank back from decisive action until every chance
of success, nay, every chance to succumb, with at least the honors of war, had
passed away. In order, then, to develop a fictitious, busy-body sort of
activity, the sheer impotency of which, coupled with its high pretension, could
not but excite pity and ridicule, they continued insinuating resolutions,
addresses, and requests to an Imperial Lieutenant, who not even noticed them;
to ministers who were in open league with the enemy. And when at last William
Wolff, member for Striegan, one of the editors of the <i>New Rhenish
Gazette,</i> the only really revolutionary man in the whole Assembly, told
them that if they meant what they said, they had better give over talking, and
declare the Imperial Lieutenant, the chief traitor to the country, an outlaw at
once; then the entire compressed virtuous indignation of these parliamentary
gentlemen burst out with an energy which they never found when the Government
heaped insult after insult upon them.</p>
<p>Of course, for Wolff's proposition was the best sensible word spoken within
the walls of St. Paul's Church; of course, for it was the very thing that was
to be done, and such plain language going so direct to the purpose, could not
but insult a set of sentimentalists, who were resolute in nothing but
irresolution, and who, too cowardly to act, had once for all made up their
minds that in doing nothing, they were doing exactly what was to be done. Every
word which cleared up, like lightning, the infatuated, but intentional
nebulosity of their minds, every hint that was adapted to lead them out of the
labyrinth where they obstinated themselves to take up as lasting an abode as
possible, every clear conception of matters as they actually stood, was, of
course, a crime against the majesty of this Sovereign Assembly.</p>
<p>Shortly after the position of the honorable gentlemen in Frankfort became
untenable, in spite of resolutions, appeals, interpellations, and
proclamations, they retreated, but not into the insurgent districts; that would
have been too resolute a step. They went to Stuttgart, where the Wurtemberg
Government kept up a sort of expectative neutrality. There, at last, they
declared the Lieutenant of the Empire to have forfeited his power, and elected
from their own body a Regency of five. This Regency at once proceeded to pass a
Militia law, which was actually in all due force sent to all the Governments of
Germany.</p>
<p>They the very enemies of the Assembly, were ordered to levy forces in its
defence! Then there was created—on paper, of course—an army for the
defence of the National Assembly. Divisions, brigades, regiments, batteries,
everything was regulated and ordained. Nothing was wanted but reality, for that
army, of course, was never called into existence.</p>
<p>One last scheme offered itself to the General Assembly. The Democratic
population from all parts of the country sent deputations to place itself at
the disposal of the Parliament, and to urge it on to a decisive action. The
people, knowing what the intentions of the Wurtemberg Government were, implored
the National Assembly to force that Government into an open and active
participation with their insurgent neighbors. But no. The National Assembly, in
going to Stuttgart, had delivered itself up to the tender mercies of the
Wurtemberg Government. The members knew it, and repressed the agitation among
the people. They thus lost the last remnant of influence which they might yet
have retained. They earned the contempt they deserved, and the Imperial
Lieutenant put a stop to the Democratic farce by shutting up, on the 18th of
June, 1849, the room where the Parliament met, and by ordering the members of
the Regency to leave the country.</p>
<p>Next they went to Baden, into the camp of the insurrection; but there they
were now useless. Nobody noticed them. The Regency, however, in the name of the
Sovereign German people, continued to save the country by its exertions. It
made an attempt to get recognized by foreign powers, by delivering
<i>passports</i> to anybody who would accept of them. It issued
proclamations, and sent commissioners to insurge those very districts of
Wurtemberg whose active assistance it had refused when it was yet time; of
course, without effect. We have now under our eye an original report, sent to
the Regency by one of these commissioners, Herr Roesler (member for Oels), the
contents of which are rather characteristic. It is dated, Stuttgart, June 30,
1849. After describing the adventures of half a dozen of these commissioners in
a resultless search for cash, he gives a series of excuses for not having yet
gone to his post, and then delivers himself of a most weighty argument
respecting possible differences between Prussia, Austria, Bavaria, and
Wurtemberg, with their possible consequences. After having fully considered
this, he comes, however, to the conclusion that there is no more chance. Next,
he proposes to establish relays of trustworthy men for the conveyance of
intelligence, and a system of espionage as to the intentions of the Wurtemberg
Ministry and the movements of the troops. This letter never reached its
address, for when it was written the "Regency" had already passed entirely into
the "foreign department," viz., Switzerland; and while poor Herr Roesler
troubled his head about the intentions of the formidable ministry of a
sixth-rate kingdom, a hundred thousand Prussian, Bavarian, and Hessian soldiers
had already settled the whole affair in the last battle under the walls of
Rastatt.</p>
<p>Thus vanished the German Parliament, and with it the first and last creation
of the Revolution. Its convocation had been the first evidence that there
actually <i>had been</i> a revolution in January; and it existed as long as
this, the first modern German Revolution, was not yet brought to a close.
Chosen under the influence of the capitalist class by a dismembered, scattered,
rural population, for the most part only awaking from the dumbness of
feudalism, this Parliament served to bring in one body upon the political arena
all the great popular names of 1820-1848, and then to utterly ruin them. All
the celebrities of middle class Liberalism were here collected. The bourgeoisie
expected wonders; it earned shame for itself and its representatives. The
industrial and commercial capitalist class were more severely defeated in
Germany than in any other country; they were first worsted, broken, expelled
from office in every individual State of Germany, and then put to rout,
disgraced and hooted in the Central German Parliament. Political Liberalism,
the rule of the bourgeoisie, be it under a Monarchical or Republican form of
government, is forever impossible in Germany.</p>
<p>In the latter period of its existence, the German Parliament served to
disgrace forever that section which had ever since March, 1848 headed the
official opposition, the Democrats representing the interests of the small
trading, and partially of the farming class. That class was, in May and June,
1849, given a chance to show its means of forming a stable Government in
Germany. We have seen how it failed; not so much by adverse circumstances as by
the actual and continued cowardice in all trying movements that had occurred
since the outbreak of the revolution; by showing in politics the same
shortsighted, pusillanimous, wavering spirit, which is characteristic of its
commercial operations. In May, 1849, it had, by this course, lost the
confidence of the real fighting mass of all European insurrections, the working
class. But yet, it had a fair chance. The German Parliament belonged to it,
exclusively, after the Reactionists and Liberals had withdrawn. The rural
population was in its favor. Two-thirds of the armies of the smaller States,
one-third of the Prussian army, the majority of the Prussian Landwehr (reserve
or militia), were ready to join it, if it only acted resolutely, and with that
courage which is the result of a clear insight into the state of things. But
the politicians who led on this class were not more clear-sighted than the host
of petty tradesmen which followed them. They proved even to be more infatuated,
more ardently attached to delusions voluntarily kept up, more credulous, more
incapable of resolutely dealing with facts than the Liberals. Their political
importance, too, is reduced below the freezing-point, But not having actually
carried their common-place principles into execution, they were, under
<i>very</i> favorable circumstances, capable of a momentary resurrection,
when this last hope was taken from them, just as it was taken from their
colleagues of the "pure Democracy" in France by the <i>coup d'etat</i> of
Louis Bonaparte.</p>
<p>The defeat of the south-west German insurrection, and the dispersion of the
German Parliament, bring the history of the first German insurrection to a
close. We have now to cast a parting glance upon the victorious members of the
counter-revolutionary alliance; we shall do this in our next letter. <a href="#1" id="a1"><span class="NOTE"><sup class="enote">[1]</sup></span></a></p>

<p class="title">Revolution and Counter-revolution in Germany</p>
<h1>II. <br>
The Prussian State.</h1>
<h5>OCTOBER 28th, 1851.</h5>
<p class="fst">THE political movement of the middle class or bourgeoisie, in
Germany, may be dated from 1840. It had been preceded by symptoms showing that
the moneyed and industrial class of that country was ripening into a state
which would no longer allow it to continue apathetic and passive under the
pressure of a half-feudal, half-bureaucratic Monarchism. The smaller princes of
Germany, partly to insure to themselves a greater independence against the
supremacy of Austria and Prussia, or against the influence of the nobility of
their own States, partly in order to consolidate into a whole the disconnected
provinces united under their rule by the Congress of Vienna, one after the
other granted constitutions of a more or less liberal character. They could do
so without any danger to themselves; for if the Diet of the Confederation, this
mere puppet of Austria and Prussia, was to encroach upon their independence as
sovereigns, they knew that in resisting its dictates they would be backed by
public opinion and the Chambers; and if, on the contrary, these Chambers grew
too strong, they could readily command the power of the Diet to break down all
opposition. The Bavarian, Wurtemberg, Baden or Hanoverian Constitutional
institutions could not, under such circumstances, give rise to any serious
struggle for political power, and, therefore, the great bulk of the German
middle class kept very generally aloof from the petty squabbles raised in the
Legislatures of the small States, well knowing that without a fundamental
change in the policy and constitution of the two great powers of Germany, no
secondary efforts and victories would be of any avail. But, at the same time, a
race of Liberal lawyers, professional oppositionists, sprung up in these small
assemblies: the Rottecks, the Welckers, the Roemers, the Jordans, the Stuves,
the Eisenmanns, those great "popular men" (Volksmänner) who, after a more or
less noisy, but always unsuccessful, opposition of twenty years, were carried
to the summit of power by the revolutionary springtide of 1848, and who, after
having there shown their utter impotency and insignificance, were hurled down
again in a moment. These first specimen upon German soil of the trader in
politics and opposition, by their speeches and writings made familiar to the
German ear the language of Constitutionalism, and by their very existence
foreboded the approach of a time when the middle class would seize upon and
restore to their proper meaning political phrases which these talkative
attorneys and professors were in the habit of using without knowing much about
the sense originally attached to them.</p>
<p>German literature, too, labored under the influence of the political
excitement into which all Europe had been thrown by the events of 1830. A crude
Constitutionalism or a still cruder Republicanism, were preached by almost all
writers of the time. It became more and more the habit, particularly of the
inferior sorts of literati, to make up for the want of cleverness in their
productions, by political allusions which were sure to attract attention.
Poetry, novels, reviews, the drama, every literary production teemed with what
was called "tendency," that is with more or less timid exhibitions of an
anti-govermental spirit. In order to complete the confusion of ideas reigning
after 1830 in Germany, with these elements of political opposition there were
mixed up ill-digested university-recollections of German philosophy, and
misunderstood gleanings from French Socialism, particularly Saint-Simonism; and
the clique of writers who expatiated upon this heterogeneous conglomerate of
ideas, presumptuously called themselves "Young Germany," or "the Modern
School." They have since repented their youthful sins, but not improved their
style of writing.</p>
<p>Lastly, German philosophy, that most complicated, but at the same time most
sure thermometer of the development of the German mind, had declared for the
middle class, when Hegel in his "Philosophy of Law" pronounced Constitutional
Monarchy to be the final and most perfect form of government. In other words,
he proclaimed the approaching advent of the middle classes of the country to
political power. His school, after his death, did not stop here. While the more
advanced section of his followers, on one hand, subjected every religious
belief to the ordeal of a rigorous criticism, and shook to its foundation the
ancient fabric of Christianity, they at the same time brought forward bolder
political principles than hitherto it had been the fate of German ears to hear
expounded, and attempted to restore to glory the memory of the heroes of the
first French Revolution. The abstruse philosophical language in which these
ideas were clothed, if it obscured the mind of both the writer and the reader,
equally blinded the eyes of the censor, and thus it was that the "young
Hegelian" writers enjoyed a liberty of the Press unknown in every other branch
of literature.</p>
<p>Thus it was evident that public opinion was undergoing a great change in
Germany. By degrees the vast majority of those classes whose education or
position in life enabled them, under an Absolute Monarchy, to gain some
political information, and to form anything like an independent political
opinion, united into one mighty phalanx of opposition against the existing
system. And in passing judgment upon the slowness of political development in
Germany no one ought to omit taking into account the difficulty of obtaining
correct information upon any subject in a country where all sources of
information were under the control of the Government, where from the Ragged
School and the Sunday School to the Newspaper and University nothing was said,
taught, printed, or published but what had previously obtained its approbation.
Look at Vienna, for instance. The people of Vienna, in industry and
manufactures, second to none perhaps in Germany; in spirit, courage, and
revolutionary energy, proving themselves far superior to all, were yet more
ignorant as to their real interests, and committed more blunders during the
Revolution than any others, and this was due in a very great measure to the
almost absolute ignorance with regard to the very commonest political subjects
in which Metternich's Government had succeeded in keeping them.</p>
<p>It needs no further explanation why, under such a system, political
information was an almost exclusive monopoly of such classes of society as
could afford to pay for its being smuggled into the country, and more
particularly of those whose interests were most seriously attacked by the
existing state of things, namely, the manufacturing and commercial classes.
They, therefore, were the first to unite in a mass against the continuance of a
more or less disguised Absolutism, and from their passing into the ranks of the
opposition must be dated the beginning of the real revolutionary movement in
Germany.</p>
<p>The oppositional pronunciamento of the German bourgeoisie may be dated from
1840, from the death of the late King of Prussia, the last surviving founder of
the Holy Alliance of 1815. The new King was known to be no supporter of the
predominantly bureaucratic and military monarchy of his father. What the French
middle class had expected from the advent of Louis XVI., the German bourgeoisie
hoped, in some measure, from Frederick William IV. of Prussia. It was agreed
upon all hands that the old system was exploded, worn-out, and must be given
up; and what had been borne in silence under the old King now was loudly
proclaimed to be intolerable.</p>
<p>But if Louis XVI., "Louis le Desire," had been a plain, unpretending
simpleton, half conscious of his own nullity, without any fixed opinions, ruled
principally by the habits contracted during his education, "Frederick William
le Desire" was something quite different. While he certainly surpassed his
French original in weakness of character, he was neither without pretensions
nor without opinions. He had made himself acquainted, in an amateur sort of
way, with the rudiments of most sciences, and thought himself, therefore,
learned enough to consider final his judgment upon every subject. He made sure
he was a first-rate orator, and there was certainly no commercial traveller in
Berlin who could beat him either in prolixity of pretended wit, or in fluency
of elocution. And, above all, he had his opinions. He hated and despised the
bureaucratic element of the Prussian Monarchy, but only because all his
sympathies were with the feudal element. Himself one of the founders of, and
chief contributors to, the <i>Berlin Political Weekly Paper,</i> the
so-called Historical School (a school living upon the ideas of Bonald, De
Maistre, and other writers of the first generation of French Legitimists), he
aimed at a restoration, as complete as possible, of the predominant social
position of the nobility. The King, first nobleman of his realm, surrounded in
the first instance by a splendid court of mighty vassals, princes, dukes, and
counts; in the second instance, by a numerous and wealthy lower nobility;
ruling according to his discretion over his loyal burgesses and peasants, and
thus being himself the chief of a complete hierarchy of social ranks or castes,
each of which was to enjoy its particular privileges, and to be separated from
the others by the almost insurmountable barrier of birth, or of a fixed,
inalterable social position; the whole of these castes, or "estates of the
realm" balancing each other at the same time so nicely in power and influence
that a complete independence of action should remain to the King—-such
was the <i>beau ideal</i> which Frederick William IV. undertook to realize,
and which he is again trying to realize at the present moment.</p>
<p>It took some time before the Prussian bourgeoisie, not very well versed in
theoretical questions, found out the real purport of their King's tendency. But
what they very soon found out was the fact that he was bent upon things quite
the reverse of what they wanted. Hardly did the new King find his "gift of the
gab" unfettered by his father's death than he set about proclaiming his
intentions in speeches without number; and every speech, every act of his, went
far to estrange from him the sympathies of the middle class. He would not have
cared much for that, if it had not been for some stern and startling realities
which interrupted his poetic dreams. Alas, that romanticism is not very quick
at accounts, and that feudalism ever since Don Quixote, reckons without its
host! Frederick William IV. partook too much of that contempt of ready cash
which ever has been the noblest inheritance of the sons of the Crusaders. He
found at his accession a costly, although parsimoniously arranged system of
government, and a moderately filled State Treasury. In two years every trace of
a surplus was spent in court festivals, royal progresses, largesses,
subventions to needy, seedy, and greedy noblemen, etc., and the regular taxes
were no longer sufficient for the exigencies of either Court or Government. And
thus His Majesty found himself very soon placed between a glaring deficit on
one side, and a law of 1820 on the other, by which any new loan, or any
increase of the then existing taxation was made illegal without the assent of
"the future Representation of the People." This representation did not exist;
the new King was less inclined than even his father to create it; and if he had
been, he knew that public opinion had wonderfully changed since his
accession.</p>
<p>Indeed, the middle classes, who had partly expected that the new King would
at once grant a Constitution, proclaim the Liberty of the Press, Trial by Jury,
etc., etc.—in short, himself take the lead of that peaceful revolution
which they wanted in order to obtain political supremacy-the middle classes had
found out their error, and had turned ferociously against the King. In the
Rhine Provinces, and more or less generally all over Prussia, they were so
exasperated that they, being short themselves of men able to represent them in
the Press, went to the length of an alliance with the extreme philosophical
party, of which we have spoken above. The fruit of this alliance was the
<i>Rhenish Gazette</i> of Cologne, <a href="#1" id="a1"><span class="NOTE"><sup class="enote">[1]</sup></span></a> a paper which was
suppressed after fifteen months' existence, but from which may be dated the
existence of the Newspaper Press in Germany. This was in 1842.</p>
<p>The poor King, whose commercial difficulties were the keenest satire upon
his Mediaeval propensities, very soon found out that he could not continue to
reign without making some slight concession to the popular outcry for that
"Representation of the People," which, as the last remnant of the
long-forgotten promises of 1813 and 1815 had been embodied in the law of 1820.
He found the least objectionable mode of satisfying this untoward law in
calling together the Standing Committees of the Provincial Diets. The
Provincial Diets had been instituted in 1823. They consisted for every one of
the eight provinces of the kingdom:—(I) Of the higher nobility, the
formerly sovereign families of the German Empire, the heads of which were
members of the Diet by birthright. (2) Of the representatives of the knights,
or lower nobility. (3) Of representatives of towns. (4) Of deputies of the
peasantry, or small farming class. The whole was arranged in such a manner that
in every province the two sections of the nobility always had a majority of the
Diet. Every one of these eight Provincial Diets elected a Committee, and these
eight Committees were now called to Berlin in order to form a Representative
Assembly for the purpose of voting the much-desired loan. It was stated that
the Treasury was full, and that the loan was required, not for current wants,
but for the construction of a State railway. But the united Committees gave the
King a flat refusal, declaring themselves incompetent to act as the
representatives of the people, and called upon His Majesty to fulfil the
promise of a Representative Constitution which his father had given, when he
wanted the aid of the people against Napoleon.</p>
<p>The sitting of the united Committees proved that the spirit of opposition
was no longer confined to the bourgeoisie. A part of the peasantry had joined
them, and many nobles, being themselves large farmers on their own properties,
and dealers in corn, wool, spirits, and flax, requiring the same guarantees
against absolutism, bureaucracy, and feudal restoration, had equally pronounced
against the Government, and for a Representative Constitution. The King's plan
had signally failed; he had got no money, and had increased the power of the
opposition. The subsequent sitting of the Provincial Diets themselves was still
more unfortunate for the King. All of them asked for reforms, for the
fulfilment of the promises of 1813 and 1815, for a Constitution and a Free
Press; the resolutions to this effect of some of them were rather
disrespectfully worded, and the ill-humored replies of the exasperated King
made the evil still greater.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the financial difficulties of the Government went on
increasing. For a time, abatements made upon the moneys appropriated for the
different public services, fraudulent transactions with the "Seehandlung," a
commercial establishment speculating and trading for account and risk of the
State, and long since acting as its money-broker, had sufficed to keep up
appearances; increased issues of State paper-money had furnished some
resources; and the secret, upon the whole, had been pretty well kept. But all
these contrivances were soon exhausted. There was another plan tried: the
establishment of a bank, the capital of which was to be furnished partly by the
State and partly by private shareholders; the chief direction to belong to the
State, in such a manner as to enable the Government to draw upon the funds of
this bank to a large amount, and thus to repeat the same fraudulent
transactions that would no longer do with the "Seehandlung." But, as a matter
of course, there were no capitalists to be found who would hand over their
money upon such conditions; the statutes of the bank had to be altered, and the
property of the shareholders guaranteed from the encroachments of the Treasury,
before any shares were subscribed for. Thus, this plan having failed, there
remained nothing but to try a loan, if capitalists could be found who would
lend their cash without requiring the permission and guarantee of that
mysterious "future Representation of the People." Rothchild was applied to, and
he declared that if the loan was to be guaranteed by this "Representation of
the People," he would undertake the thing at a moment's notice—if not, he
could not have anything to do with the transaction.</p>
<p>Thus every hope of obtaining money had vanished, and there was no
possibility of escaping the fatal "Representation of the People." Rothschild's
refusal was known in autumn, 1846, and in February of the next year the King
called together all the eight Provincial Diets to Berlin, forming them into one
"United Diet." This Diet was to do the work required, in case of need, by the
law of 1820; it was to vote loans and increased taxes, but beyond that it was
to have no rights. Its voice upon general legislation was to be merely
consultative; it was to assemble, not at fixed periods, but whenever it pleased
the King; it was to discuss nothing but what the Government pleased to lay
before it. Of course, the members were very little satisfied with the part they
were expected to perform. They repeated the wishes they had enounced when they
met in the provincial assembles; the relations between them and the Government
soon became acrimonious, and when the loan, which was again stated to be
required for railway constructions, was demanded from them, they again refused
to grant it.</p>
<p>This vote very soon brought their sitting to a close. The King, more and
more exasperated, dismissed them with a reprimand, but still remained without
money. And, indeed, he had every reason to be alarmed at his position, seeing
that the Liberal League, headed by the middle classes, comprising a large part
of the lower nobility, and all the different sections of the lower
orders—that this Liberal League was determined to have what it wanted. In
vain the King had declared, in the opening speech, that he would never, never
grant a Constitution in the modern sense of the word; the Liberal League
insisted upon such a modern, anti-feudal, Representative Constitution, with all
its sequels, Liberty of the Press, Trial by Jury, etc.; and before they got it,
not a farthing of money would they grant. There was one thing evident: that
things could not go on long in this manner, and that either one of the parties
must give way, or that a rupture—a bloody struggle—must ensue. And
the middle classes knew that they were on the eve of a revolution, and they
prepared themselves for it. They sought to obtain by every possible means the
support of the working class of the towns, and of the peasantry in the
agricultural districts, and it is well known that there was, in the latter end
of 1847, hardly a single prominent political character among the bourgeoisie
who did not proclaim himself a "Socialist," in order to insure to himself the
sympathy of the proletarian class. We shall see these "Socialists" at work by
and by.</p>
<p>This eagerness of the leading bourgeoisie to adopt, at least the outward
show of Socialism, was caused by a great change that had come over the working
classes of Germany. There had been ever since 1840 a fraction of German
workmen, who, travelling in France and Switzerland, had more or less imbibed
the crude Socialist or Communist notions then current among the French workmen.
The increasing attention paid to similar ideas in France ever since 1840 made
Socialism and Communism fashionable in Germany also, and as far back as 1843,
all newspapers teemed with discussions of social questions. A school of
Socialists very soon formed itself in Germany, distinguished more for the
obscurity than for the novelty of its ideas; its principal efforts consisted in
the translation of French Fourierist, Saint-Simonian, and other doctrines into
the abstruse language of German philosophy. The German Communist school,
entirely different from this sect, was formed about the same time.</p>
<p>In 1844, there occurred the Silesian weavers' riots, followed by the
insurrection of the calico printers of Prague. These riots, cruelly suppressed,
riots of working men not against the Government, but against their employers,
created a deep sensation, and gave a new stimulus to Socialist and Communist
propaganda amongst the working people. So did the bread riots during the year
of famine, 1847. In short, in the same manner as Constitutional Opposition
rallied around its banner the great bulk of the propertied classes (with the
exception of the large feudal land-holders), so the working classes of the
larger towns looked for their emancipation to the Socialist and Communist
doctrines, although, under the then existing Press laws, they could be made to
know only very little about them. They could not be expected to have any very
definite ideas as to what they wanted; they only knew that the programme of the
Constitutional bourgeoisie did not contain all they wanted, and that their
wants were no wise contained in the Constitutional circle of ideas.</p>
<p>There was then no separate Republican party in Germany. People were either
Constitutional Monarchists, or more or less clearly defined Socialists or
Communists.</p>
<p>With such elements the slightest collision must have brought about a great
revolution. While the higher nobility and the older civil and military officers
were the only safe supports of the existing system; while the lower nobility,
the trading middle classes, the universities, the school-masters of every
degree, and even part of the lower ranks of the bureaucracy and military
officers were all leagued against the Government; while behind these there
stood the dissatisfied masses of the peasantry, and of the proletarians of the
large towns, supporting, for the time being, the Liberal Opposition, but
already muttering strange words about taking things into their own hands; while
the bourgeoisie was ready to hurl down the Government, and the proletarians
were preparing to hurl down the bourgeoisie in its turn; this Government went
on obstinately in a course which must bring about a collision. Germany was, in
the beginning of 1848, on the eve of a revolution, and this revolution was sure
to come, even had the French Revolution of February not hastened it.</p>
<p>What the effects of this Parisian Revolution were upon Germany we shall see
in our next.</p>

<p class="fst"><a href="#a1" id="1"><span class="term">[1]</span></a> "The
Rhenish Gazette." This paper was published at Cologne, as the organ of the
Liberal leaders, Hansemann and Camphausen. Marx contributed certain articles on
the Landtag, which created so great a sensation that he was offered in
1842—although only 21 years of age—the editorship of the paper. He
accepted the offer, and then began his long fight with the Prussian Government.
Of course the paper was published under the supervision of a censor, but he,
good, easy man, was hopelessly outwitted by the young firebrand. So the
Government sent a second "special" censor from Berlin, but the double
censorship proved unequal to the task, and in 1843 the paper was suppressed.</p>

<h1>XII. <br>
The Storming of Vienna—The Betrayal of Vienna</h1>
<h5>APRIL 9th, 1852.</h5>
<p class="fst">WHEN at last the concentrated army of Windisgratz commenced the
attack upon Vienna, the forces that could be brought forward in defence were
exceedingly insufficient for the purpose. Of the National Guard only a portion
was to be brought to the entrenchments. A Proletarian Guard, it is true, had at
last been hastily formed, but owing to the lateness of the attempt to thus make
available the most numerous, most daring. and most energetic part of the
population, it was too little inured to the use of arms and to the very first
rudiments of discipline to offer a successful resistance. Thus the Academic
Legion, three to four thousand strong, well exercised and disciplined to a
certain degree, brave and enthusiastic, was, militarily speaking, the only
force which was in a state to do its work successfully. But what were they,
together with the few reliable National Guards, and with the confused mass of
the armed proletarians, in opposition to the far more numerous regulars of
Windischgratz, not counting even the brigand hordes of Jellachich, hordes that
were, by the very nature of their habits, very useful in a war from house to
house, from lane to lane? And what but a few old, outworn, ill-mounted, and
ill-served pieces of ordnance had the insurgents to oppose to that numerous and
well-appointed artillery, of which Windischgratz made such an unscrupulous
use?</p>
<p>The nearer the danger drew, the more grew the confusion in Vienna. The Diet,
up to the last moment, could not collect sufficient energy to call in for aid
the Hungarian army of Perczel, encamped a few leagues below the capital. The
committee passed contradictory resolutions, they themselves being, like the
popular armed masses, floated up and down with the alternately rising and
receding tide of rumors and counter-rumors. There was only one thing upon which
all agreed—to respect property; and this was done in a degree almost
ludicrous for such times. As to the final arrangement of a plan of defence,
very little was done. Bem, the only man present who could have saved Vienna, if
any could then in Vienna, an almost unknown foreigner, a Slavonian by birth,
gave up the task, overwhelmed as he was by universal distrust. Had he
persevered, he might have been lynched as a traitor. Messenhauser, the
commander of the insurgent forces, more of a novel-writer than even of a
subaltern officer, was totally inadequate to the task; and yet, after eight
months of revolutionary struggles, the popular party had not produced or
acquired a military man of more ability than he. Thus the contest began. The
Viennese considering their utterly inadequate means of defence, considering
their utter absence of military skill and organization in the ranks, offered a
most heroic resistance. In many places the order given Bem, when he was in
command, "to defend that post to the last man," was carried out to the letter.
But force prevailed. Barricade after barricade was swept away by the imperial
artillery in the long and wide avenues which form the main streets of the
suburbs; and on the evening of the second day's fighting the Croats occupied
the range of houses facing the glacis of the Old Town. A feeble and disorderly
attack of the Hungarian army had been utterly defeated; and during an
armistice, while some parties in the Old Town capitulated, while others
hesitated and spread confusion, while the remnants of the Academic Legion
prepared fresh intrenchments, an entrance was made by the imperialists, and in
the midst of the general disorder the Old Town was carried.</p>
<p>The immediate consequences of this victory, the brutalities and executions
by martial law, the unheard-of cruelties and infamies committed by the
Slavonian hordes let loose upon Vienna, are too well known to be detailed here.
The ulterior consequences, the entirely new turn given to German affairs by the
defeat of the revolution in Vienna, we shall have reason to notice hereafter.
There remain two points to be considered in connection with the storming of
Vienna. The people of that capital had two allies—the Hungarians and the
German people. Where were they in the hour of trial?</p>
<p>We have seen that the Viennese, with all the generosity of a newly freed
people, had risen for a cause which, though ultimately their own, was in the
first instance, and above all, that of the Hungarians. Rather than suffer the
Austrian troops to march upon Hungary, they would draw their first and most
terrific onslaught upon themselves. And while they thus nobly came forward for
the support of their allies, the Hungarians, successful against Jellachich,
drove him upon Vienna, and by their victory strengthened the force that was to
attack that town. Under these circumstances it was the clear duty of Hungary to
support, without delay, and with all disposable forces, not the Diet of Vienna,
not the Committee of Safety or any other official body at Vienna, but the
<i>Viennese</i> revolution. And if Hungary should even have forgotten that
Vienna had fought the first battle of Hungary, she owed it to her own safety
not to forget that Vienna was the only outpost of Hungarian independence, and
that after the fall of Vienna nothing could meet the advance of the imperial
troops against herself. Now, we know very well all the Hungarians can say and
have said in defence of their inactivity during the blockade and storming of
Vienna: the insufficient state of their own force, the refusal of the Diet or
any other official body in Vienna to call them in, the necessity to keep on
constitutional ground, and to avoid complications with the German central
power. But the fact is, as to the insufficient state of the Hungarian army,
that in the first days after the Viennese revolution and the arrival of
Jellachich, nothing was wanted in the shape of regular troops, as the Austrian
regulars were very far from being concentrated; and that a courageous,
unrelenting following up of the first advantage over Jellachich, even with
nothing but the <i>Land Sturm </i>that had fought at Stuhlweissenburg, would
have sufficed to effect a junction with the Viennese, and to adjourn to that
day six months every concentration of an Austrian army. In war, and
particularly in revolutionary warfare, rapidity of action until some decided
advantage is gained is the first rule, and we have no hesitation in saying that
upon <i>merely military grounds</i> Perczel ought not to have stopped until
his junction with the Viennese was affected. There was certainly some risk, but
who ever won a battle without risking something? And did the people of Vienna
risk nothing when they drew upon themselves—they, a population of four
hundred thousand—the forces that were to march to the conquest of twelve
millions of Hungarians? The military fault committed by waiting until the
Austrians had united, and by making the feeble demonstration at Schwechat which
ended, as it deserved to do, in an inglorious defeat—this military fault
certainly incurred more risks than a resolute march upon Vienna against the
disbanded brigands of Jellachich would have done.</p>
<p>But, it is said, such an advance of the Hungarians, unless authorized by
some official body, would have been a violation of the German territory, would
have brought on complications with the central power at Frankfort, and would
have been, above all, an abandonment of the legal and constitutional policy
which formed the strength of the Hungarian cause. Why, the official bodies in
Vienna were nonentities! Was it the Diet, was it the popular committees, who
had risen for Hungary, or was it the people of Vienna, and they alone, who had
taken to the musket to stand the brunt of the first battle for Hungary's
independence? It was not this nor that official body in Vienna which it was
important to uphold; all these bodies might, and would have been, upset very
soon in the progress of the revolutionary development; but it was the
ascendancy of the revolutionary movement, the unbroken progress of popular
action itself, which alone was in question, and which alone could save Hungary
from invasion. What forms this revolutionary movement afterwards might take,
was the business of the Viennese, not of the Hungarians, so long as Vienna and
German Austria at large continued their allies against the common enemy. But
the question is, whether in this stickling of the Hungarian government for some
quasi-legal authorization, we are not to see the first clear symptom of that
pretence to a rather doubtful legality of proceeding, which, if it did not save
Hungary, at least told very well, at a later period, before the English middle
class audiences.</p>
<p>As to the pretext of possible conflicts with the central power of Germany at
Frankfort, it is quite futile. The Frankfort authorities were <i>de facto</i>
upset by the victory of the counter-revolution at Vienna; they would have been
equally upset had the revolution there found the support necessary to defeat
its enemies. And lastly,the great argument that Hungary could not leave legal
and constitutional ground, may do very well for British free-traders, but it
will never be deemed sufficient in the eyes of history. Suppose the people of
Vienna had stuck to "legal and constitutional means" on the 13th of March, and
on the 6th of October, what then of the "legal and constitutional" movement,
and of all the glorious battles which, for the first time, brought Hungary to
the notice of the civilized world? The very legal and constitutional ground
upon which it is asserted the Hungarians moved in 1848 and 1849 was conquered
for them by the exceedingly illegal and unconstitutional rising of the people
of Vienna on the 13th March. It is not to our purpose here to discuss the
revolutionary history of Hungary, but it may be deemed proper if we observe
that it is utterly useless to professedly use merely legal means of resistance
against an enemy who scorns such scruples; and if we add, that had it not been
for this eternal pretence of legality which Gorgey seized upon and turned
against the Government, the devotion of Gorgey's army to its general, and the
disgraceful catastrophe of Villagos, would have been impossible. And when, at
last, to save their honor, the Hungarians came across the Leitha, in the latter
end of October, 1848, was not this quite as illegal as any immediate and
resolute attack would have been?</p>
<p>We are known to harbor no unfriendly feeling toward Hungary. We stood by her
during the struggles; we may be allowed to say that our paper, the <i>Neue
Rheinische Zeitung,</i> <a href="#1" id="a1"><span class="NOTE"><sup class="enote">[1]</sup></span></a> has done more than any other to render the
Hungarian cause popular in Germany, by explaining the nature of the struggle
between the Magyar and Slavonian races, and by following up the Hungarian war
in a series of articles which have had paid them the compliment of being
plagiarized in almost every subsequent book upon the subject, the works of
native Hungarians and "eyewitnesses" not excepted. We even now, in any future
continental convulsion, consider Hungary as the necessary and natural ally of
Germany. But we have been severe enough upon our own countrymen, to have a
right to speak out upon our neighbors; and then we have here to record facts
with historical impartiality, and we must say that in this particular instance,
the generous bravery of the people of Vienna was not only fat more noble, but
also more far-sighted than the cautious circumspection of the Hungarian
Government. And, as a German, we may further be allowed to say, that not for
all the showy victories and glorious battles of the Hungarian campaign, would
we exchange that spontaneous, single-handed rising, and heroic resistance of
the people of Vienna, our countrymen, which gave Hungary the time to organize
the army that could do such great things.</p>
<p>The second ally of Vienna was the German people. But they were everywhere
engaged in the same struggle as the Viennese. Frankfort, Baden, Cologne, had
just been defeated and disarmed. In Berlin and Breslau the people were at
daggers-drawn with the army, and daily expected to come to blows. Thus it was
in every local center of action. Everywhere questions were pending that could
only be settled by the force of arms; and now it was that for the first time
were severely felt the disastrous consequences of the continuation of the old
dismemberment and decentralization of Germany. The different questions in every
State, every province, every town, were fundamentally the same; but they were
brought forward everywhere under different shapes and pretexts, and had
everywhere attained different degrees of maturity. Thus it happened that while
in every locality the decisive gravity of the events at Vienna was felt, yet
nowhere could an important blow be struck with any hope of bringing the
Viennese succor, or making a diversion in their favor; and there remained
nothing to aid them but the Parliament and Central Power of Frankfort; they
were appealed to on all hands; but what did they do?</p>
<p>The Frankfort Parliament and the bastard child it had brought to light by
incestuous intercourse with the old German Diet, the so-called Central Power,
profited by the Viennese movement to show forth their utter nullity. This
contemptible Assembly, as we have seen, had long since sacrificed its
virginity, and young as it was, it was already turning grey-headed and
experienced in all the artifices of painting and pseudo-diplomatic
prostitution. Of the dreams and illusions of power, of German regeneration and
unity, that in the beginning had pervaded it, nothing remained but a set of
Teutonic clap-trap phraseology, that was repeated on every occasion, and a firm
belief of each individual member in his own importance, as well as in the
credulity of the public. The original naivety was discarded; the
representatives of the German people had turned practical men, that is to say,
they had made it out that the less they did, and the more they prated, the
safer would be their position as the umpires of the fate of Germany. Not that
they considered their proceedings superfluous; quite the contrary. But they had
found out that all really great questions, being to them forbidden ground, had
better be let alone, and there, like a set of Byzantine doctors of the Lower
Empire, they discussed with an importance and assiduity worthy of the fate that
at last overtook them, theoretical dogmas long ago settled in every part of the
civilized world, or microscopical practical questions which never led to any
practical result. Thus, the Assembly being a sort of Lancastrian School for the
mutual instruction of members, and being, therefore, very important to
themselves, they were persuaded it was doing ever more than the German people
had a right to expect, and looked upon everyone as a traitor to the country who
had impudence to ask them to come to any result.</p>
<p>When the Viennese insurrection broke out, there was a host of
interpellations, debates, motions, and amendments upon it, which, of course,
led to nothing. The Central Power was to interfere. It sent two commissioners,
Welcker, the ex-Liberal, and Mosle, to Vienna. The travels of Don Quixote and
Sancho Panza form matter for an Odyssey in comparison with the heroic feats and
wonderful adventures of those two knight-errants of German Unity. Not daring to
go to Vienna, they were bullied by Windischgratz, wondered at by the idiot
Emperor, and impudently hoaxed by the Minister Stadion. Their despatches and
reports are perhaps the only portion of the Frankfort transactions that will
retain a place in German literature; they are a perfect satirical romance,
ready cut and dried, and an eternal monument of disgrace for the Frankfort
Assembly and its Government.</p>
<p>The left side of the Assembly had also sent two commissioners to Vienna, in
order to uphold its authority there—Froebel and Robert Blum. Blum, when
danger drew near, judged rightly that here the great battle of the German
Revolution was to be fought, and unhesitatingly resolved to stake his head on
the issue. Froebel, on the contrary, was of opinion that it was his duty to
preserve himself for the important duties of his post at Frankfort. Blum was
considered one of the most eloquent men of the Frankfort Assembly; he certainly
was the most popular. His eloquence would not have stood the test of any
experienced Parliamentary Assembly; he was too fond of the shallow declamations
of a German dissenting preacher, and his arguments wanted both philosophical
acumen and acquaintance with practical matters of fact. In politics he belonged
to "Moderate Democracy," a rather indefinite sort of thing, cherished on
account of this very want of definiteness in its principles. But with all this
Robert Blum was by nature a thorough, though somewhat polished, plebeian, and
in decisive moments his plebeian instinct and plebeian energy got the better of
his indefiniteness, and, therefore, indecisive political persuasion and
knowledge. In such moments he raised himself far above the usual standard of
his capacities.</p>
<p>Thus, in Vienna, he saw at a glance that here, not in the midst of the
would-be elegant debates of Frankfort, the fate of his country would have to be
decided. He at once made up his mind, gave up all idea of retreat, took a
command in the revolutionary force, and behaved with extraordinary coolness and
decision. It was he who retarded for a considerable time the taking of the
town, and covered one of its sides from attack by burning the Tabor Bridge over
the Danube. Everybody knows how, after the storming, he was arrested, tried by
court-martial, and shot. He died like a hero. And the Frankfort Assembly,
horrorstruck as it was, yet took the bloody insult with a seeming good grace. A
resolution was carried, which, by the softness and diplomatic decency of its
language, was more an insult to the grave of the murdered martyr than a damning
stain upon Austria. But it was not to be expected that this contemptible
Assembly should resent the assassination of one of its members, particularly of
the leader of the Left.</p>

<p class="fst"><a href="#a1" id="1"><span class="NOTE">[1]</span></a> "Die
Neue Rheinische Zeitung" (The New Rhenish Gazette). After the March revolution,
1848, Marx returned from Paris to Germany, and settling down—for the time
being—at Cologne, founded this paper. Although the "Neue Rheinische
Zeitung" never went in for propounding "Communist schemes," as Mr. Dawson, e.
g., says it did, it became a very nightmare to the Government. Reactionaries
and Liberals alike denounced the "Gazette," especially after Marx's brilliant
defence of the Paris Insurrection of June. The state of siege being declared in
Cologne, the "Gazette" was suspended for six weeks—only to appear with a
bigger reputation and bigger circulation than before. After the Prussian "coup
d'etat" in November, the "Gazette" published at the head of every issue an
appeal to the people to refuse to pay taxes, and to meet force by force. For
this and certain other articles the paper was twice prosecuted. On the first
occasion the accused were Marx, Engels, and Korff; on the second and more
important trial, they were Marx, Schapper, and Schneider. The accused were
charged with "inciting the people to armed resistance against the Government
and its officials." Marx mainly conducted the defence, and delivered a
brilliant speech. "Marx refrains" (in this speech) "from all oratorical
flourish; he goes straight to the point, and without any peroration ends with a
summary of the political situation. Anyone would think that Marx's own
personality was to deliver a political lecture to the jury. And, in fact, at
the end of the trial, one of the jurors went to Marx to thank him, in the name
of his colleagues, for the instructive lecture he had given them." (See
Bernstein's work, "Ferdinand Lassalle.") The accused were unanimously acquitted
by the jury. Among the better known of the contributors of the "New Rhenish
Gazette," edited by Marx, were Engels, W. Wolff, Werth, Lassalle; while
Freiligrath wrote for it his splendid revolutionary poems. Perhaps one of the
grandest of these is the celebrated "Farewell of the "Rhenish Gazette"." when
on the 19th May, l849, the final number of the paper—suppressed by the
Government—appeared, printed in red type.</p>
<p class="quoteb">"When the last of crowns like glass shall break,<br>
On the scene our sorrows have haunted.<br>
And the people the last dread 'Guilty' shall speak, <br>

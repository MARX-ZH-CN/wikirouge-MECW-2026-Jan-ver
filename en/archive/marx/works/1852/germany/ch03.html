<p class="title">Revolution and Counter-revolution in Germany</p>
<h1>III. <br>
The Other German States.</h1>
<h5>NOVEMBER 6th, 1851.</h5>
<p class="fst">IN our last we confined ourselves almost exclusively to that
State which, during the years 1840 to 1848, was by far the most important in
the German movement, namely, to Prussia. It is, however, time to pass a rapid
glance over the other States of Germany during the same period.</p>
<p>As to the petty States, they had, ever since the revolutionary movements of
1830, completely passed under the dictatorship of the Diet, that is of Austria
and Prussia. The several Constitutions, established as much as a means of
defence against the dictates of the larger States, as to insure popularity to
their princely authors, and unity to heterogeneous Assemblies of Provinces,
formed by the Congress of Vienna, without any leading principle
whatever—these Constitutions, illusory as they were, had yet proved
dangerous to the authority of the petty princes themselves during the exciting
times of 1830 and 1831. They were all but destroyed; whatever of them was
allowed to remain was less than a shadow, and it required the loquacious
self-complacency of a Welcker, a Rotteck, a Dahlmann, to imagine that any
results could possibly flow from the humble opposition, mingled with degrading
flattery, which they were allowed to show off in the impotent Chambers of these
petty States.</p>
<p>The more energetic portion of the middle class in these smaller States, very
soon after 1840, abandoned all the hopes they had formerly based upon the
development of Parliamentary government in these dependencies of Austria and
Prussia. No sooner had the Prussian bourgeoisie and the classes allied to it
shown a serious resolution to struggle for Parliamentary government in Prussia,
than they were allowed to take the lead of the Constitutional movement over all
non-Austrian Germany. It is a fact which now will not any longer be contested,
that the nucleus of those Constitutionalists of Central Germany, who afterwards
seceded from the Frankfort National Assembly, and who, from the place of their
separate meetings, were called the Gotha party, long before 1848 contemplated a
plan which, with little modification, they in 1849 proposed to the
representatives of all Germany. They intended a complete exclusion of Austria
from the German Confederation, the establishment of a new confederation with a
new fundamental law, and with a federal parliament,
<!-- text was missing here mh captured from marx2mao.com -->under the
protection of Prussia, and, the incorporation of the more insignificant states
into the larger ones. <!-- end of insertion -->All this was to be carried out
the moment Prussia entered into the ranks of Constitutional Monarchy,
established the Liberty of the Press, assumed a policy independent from that of
Russia and Austria, and thus enabled the Constitutionalists of the lesser
States to obtain a real control over their respective Governments. The inventor
of this scheme was Professor Gervinus, of Heidelberg (Baden). Thus the
emancipation of the Prussian bourgeoisie was to be the signal for that of the
middle classes of Germany generally, and for an alliance, offensive and
defensive of both against Russia and Austria, for Austria was, as we shall see
presently, considered as an entirely barbarian country, of which very little
was known, and that little not to the credit of its population; Austria,
therefore, was not considered as an essential part of Germany.</p>
<p>As to the other classes of society, in the smaller States they followed,
more or less rapidly, in the wake of their equals in Prussia. The shopkeeping
class got more and more dissatisfied with their respective Governments, with
the increase of taxation, with the curtailments of those political
sham-privileges of which they used to boast when comparing themselves to the
"slaves of despotism" in Austria and Prussia; but as yet they had nothing
definite in their opposition which might stamp them as an independent party,
distinct from the Constitutionalism of the higher bourgeoisie. The
dissatisfaction among the peasantry was equally growing, but it is well known
that this section of the people, in quiet and peaceful times, will never assert
its interests and assume its position as an independent class, except in
countries where universal suffrage is established. The working classes in the
trades and manufactures of the towns commenced to be infected with the "poison"
of Socialism and Communism, but there being few towns of any importance out of
Prussia, and still fewer manufacturing districts, the movement of this class,
owing to the want of centres of action and propaganda, was extremely slow in
the smaller States.</p>
<p>Both in Prussia and in the smaller States the difficulty of giving vent to
political opposition created a sort of religious opposition in the parallel
movements of German Catholicism and Free Congregationalism. History affords us
numerous examples where, in countries which enjoy the blessings of a State
Church, and where political discussion is fettered, the profane and dangerous
opposition against the worldly power is hid under the more sanctified and
apparently more disinterested struggle against spiritual despotism. Many a
Government that will not allow of any of its acts being discussed, will
hesitate before it creates martyrs and excites the religious fanaticism of the
masses. Thus in Germany, in 1845, in every State, either the Roman Catholic or
the Protestant religion, or both, were considered part and parcel of the law of
the land. In every State, too, the clergy of either of those denominations, or
of both, formed an essential part of the bureaucratic establishment of the
Government. To attack Protestant or Catholic orthodoxy, to attack priestcraft,
was then to make an underhand attack upon the Government itself. As to the
German Catholics, their very existence was an attack upon the Catholic
Governments of Germany, particularly Austria and Bavaria; and as such it was
taken by those Governments. The Free Congregationalists, Protestant Dissenters,
somewhat resembling the English and American Unitarians, openly professed their
opposition to the clerical and rigidly orthodox tendency of the King of Prussia
and his favourite Minister for the Educational and Clerical Department, Mr.
Eickhorn. The two new sects, rapidly extending for a moment, the first in
Catholic, the second in Protestant countries, had no other distinction but
their different origin; as to their tenets, they perfectly agreed upon this
most important point that all definite dogmas were nugatory. This want of any
definition was their very essence; they pretended to build that great temple
under the roof of which all Germans might unite; they thus represented, in a
religious form, another political idea of the day—that of German unity,
and yet they could never agree among themselves.</p>
<p>The idea of German unity, which the above-mentioned sects sought to realize,
at least, upon religious ground, by inventing a common religion for all
Germans, manufactured expressly for their use, habits, and taste—this
idea was, indeed, very widely spread, particularly in the smaller States. Ever
since the dissolution of the German Empire by Napoleon, the cry for a union of
all the <i>disjecta membra</i> of the German body had been the most general
expression of discontent with the established order of things, and most so in
the smaller States, where costliness of a court, an administration, an army, in
short, the dead weight of taxation, increased in a direct ratio with the
smallness and impotency of the State. But what this German unity was to be when
carried out was a question upon which parties disagreed. The bourgeoisie, which
wanted no serious revolutionary convulsion, were satisfied with what we have
seen they considered "practicable," namely a union of all Germany, exclusive of
Austria, under the supremacy of a Constitutional Government of Prussia; and
surely, without conjuring dangerous storms, nothing more could, at that time,
be done. The shopkeeping class and the peasantry, as far as these latter
troubled themselves about such things, never arrived at any definition of that
German unity they so loudly clamoured after; a few dreamers, mostly feudalist
reactionists, hoped for the reestablishment of the German Empire; some few
ignorant, <i>soi-disant</i> Radicals, admiring Swiss institutions, of which
they had not yet made that practical experience which afterwards most
ludicrously undeceived them, pronounced for a Federated Republic; and it was
only the most extreme party which, at that time, dared pronounce for a German
Republic, one and indivisible. Thus, German unity was in itself a question big
with disunion, discord, and, in the case of certain eventualities, even civil
war.</p>
<p>To resume, then: this was the state of Prussia, and the smaller States of
Germany, at the end of 1847. The middle class, feeling their power, and
resolved not to endure much longer the fetters with which a feudal and
bureaucratic despotism enchained their commercial transactions, their
industrial productivity, their common action as a class; a portion of the
landed nobility so far changed into producers of mere marketable commodities,
as to have the same interests and to make common cause with the middle class;
the smaller trading class, dissatisfied, grumbling at the takes, at the
impediments thrown in the way of their business, but without any definite plan
for such reforms as should secure their position in the social and political
body; the peasantry, oppressed here by feudal exactions, there by
money-lenders, usurers, and lawyers; the working people of the towns infected
with the general discontent, equally hating the Government and the large
industrial capitalists, and catching the contagion of Socialist and Communist
ideas; in short, a heterogeneous mass of opposition, springing from various
interests, but more or less led on by the bourgeoisie, in the first ranks of
which again marched the bourgeoisie of Prussia, and particularly of the Rhine
Province. On the other hand, Governments disagreeing upon many points,
distrustful of each other, and particularly of that of Prussia, upon which yet
they had to rely for protection; in Prussia a Government forsaken by public
opinion, forsaken by even a portion of the nobility, leaning upon an army and a
bureaucracy which every day got more infected by the ideas, and subjected to
the influence, of the oppositional bourgeoisie—a Government, besides all
this, penniless in the most literal meaning of the word, and which could not
procure a single cent to cover its increasing deficit, but by surrendering at
discretion to the opposition of the bourgeoisie. Was there ever a more splendid
position for the middle class of any country, while it struggled for power
against the established Government?</p>

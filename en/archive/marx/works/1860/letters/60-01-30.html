<h4>London, 30 January 1860</h4>
<p>Dear Lassalle,</p>
<p>I was very glad to get your letter. For I had believed — and had written to tell Engels so — that your reason for not writing was pique at my last letter.</p>
<p>I can only spare a minute or two since I have a leader to write today for the <i>New-York Tribune</i>. Quite briefly then:</p>
<p>1. I shall send you the pamphlet on the ‘Communist Trial’ straight away. So far as I am aware, you have already had one from me.</p>
<p>2. Vogt has been careful not to let his <i>Telleringian </i>concoction — i.e. the first version — reach us here. Neither Freiligrath (whom I have just seen) nor Kinkel, nor the <i>Hermann, </i>nor <i>any of the booksellers over here </i>have had it. The imperial rascal wishes, <strong>of course</strong>, to steal a march on me.</p>
<p>What I know, I have learned from the <i>National-Zeitung. </i>A pack of <i>Stieberian </i>lies. I have written and told my <i>lawyer in Berlin </i>to sue the N-Z. for <i>libel. </i>What do you think of this? Let me know <i>by return.</i></p>
<p>From your letter I see that Vogt himself admits having been bought <i>indirectly </i>by Bonaparte, for I <i>know </i>about the <i>manoeuvres </i>of your revolutionary Hungarians. I denounced them in London in an <i>English </i>paper and had five <strong>copies</strong> sent to Mr Kossuth. He kept his trap shut. In New York, and elsewhere, <i>Hungarian refugees </i>have adopted resolutions <i>censuring him.</i></p>
<p>Your reasoning <i>ad vocem </i>Vogt eludes me. I shall <i>write a pamphlet </i>as soon as I get hold of his rubbish. But I shall begin by saying in the foreword that I <i>don’t give a damn </i>about the opinion of <i>your German public.</i></p>
<p><i>Liebknecht</i> is an upright man. The Augsburg <i>Allgemeine Zeitung </i>is — to <i>my </i>mind — just as good as the <i>N-Z. </i>and the <i>Volks-Zeitung.</i></p>
<p>To judge by the excerpts I have seen in the <i>N-Zeitung, </i>Vogt is some kind of Chenu or de la Hodde.</p>
<p>3. About my work on political economy — the second instalment, when it appears, will contain only the conclusion of section 1, Book 1, and there are six books. Hence you cannot wait <i>until it is finished </i>. However, you would, in <i>your own interests, </i>be well-advised to await the next instalment which contains the <i>quintessence. </i>Appalling circumstances are to blame for the fact that it isn’t yet in Berlin.</p>
<p class="sig">Salut.<br>
K. M.</p>

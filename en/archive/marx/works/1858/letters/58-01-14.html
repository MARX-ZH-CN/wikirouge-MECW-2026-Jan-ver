<h4>Manchester, 14 January 1858<br>
7 Southgate</h4>
<p>Dear Marx,</p>
<p>Herewith the article, though it has just occurred to me that by a ludicrous slip I have written Wilson throughout instead of <i>Inglis</i>; perhaps you would alter this as there’s no time to do so now.</p>
<p>I shall do a few more C’s for Tuesday, and finish ‘Cavalry’, which should make a good article and also be somewhat longer.</p>
<p>Apropos, have you done ‘Coehoorn’ (Baron)? If not I have some excellent material.</p>
<p>NB. I've <i>no material whatever </i>on ‘<i>Catapults</i>’ — there should be something in Ersch and Gruber.</p>
<p>The Lucknow garrison’s greatest act of heroism consisted in the fact <strong>that they had to face every day the ‘coarse beef’ cooked by the ladies</strong>, ‘<strong>entirely unaided</strong>’. Must have been damned badly cooked. The <i>Daily News </i>has something on Windham, but not enough.</p>
<p>Kindest regards to your wife and children.</p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
F. E.</p>
<p>My health is good. The sores have all been healed for the last 6 weeks. Heckscher is very satisfied with the way the thing is progressing, but he’s still limiting what I eat and drink — not so much in quantity as in kind.</p>

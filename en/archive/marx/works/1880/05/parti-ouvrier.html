<p class="title">Karl Marx and Jules Guesde 1880</p>
<h1>The Programme of the Parti Ouvrier</h1>
<hr class="end"/>
<p class="information">
This document was drawn up in May 1880, when French workers'
leader Jules Guesde came to visit Marx in London. The Preamble
was dictated by Marx himself, while the other two parts of minimum
political and economic demands were formulated by Marx and Guesde,
with assistance from Engels and Paul Lafargue, who with Guesde
was to become a leading figure in the Marxist wing of French socialism.
The programme was adopted, with certain amendments, by the founding
congress of the Parti Ouvrier (PO) at Le Havre in November 1880.</p>
<p class="information">
Concerning the programme Marx wrote: “this very brief
document in its economic section consists solely of demands that
actually have spontaneously arisen out of the labour movement
itself. There is in addition an introductory passage where the
communist goal is defined in a few lines.” 
<a href="#n1"><sup class="enote">[1]</sup></a> Engels described the first, maximum
section, as “a masterpiece of cogent argumentation rarely
encountered, clearly and succinctly written for the masses; I
myself was astonished by this concise formulation” <a href="#n2"><sup class="enote">[2]</sup></a> and he later recommended the economic
section to the German social democrats in his critique of the
draft of the 1891 Erfurt Programme. <a href="#n3"><sup class="enote">[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class="information">
After the programme was agreed, however,
a clash arose between Marx and his French supporters arose over
the purpose of the minimum section. Whereas Marx saw this as a
practical means of agitation around demands that were achievable
within the framework of capitalism, Guesde took a very different
view: “Discounting the possibility of obtaining these reforms
from the bourgeoisie, Guesde regarded them not as a practical
programme of struggle, but simply ... as bait with which to lure
the workers from Radicalism.” The rejection of these reforms
would, Guesde believed, “free the proletariat of its
last reformist illusions and convince it of the impossibility
of avoiding a workers ’89.”
<a href="#n4"><sup class="enote">[4]</sup></a> Accusing Guesde and Lafargue of “revolutionary
phrase-mongering” and of denying the value of reformist struggles,
Marx made his famous remark that, if their politics represented
Marxism, “<i>ce qu'il y a de certain c'est que moi, je ne suis pas
Marxiste</i>” (“what is certain is that I myself am not
a Marxist”). <a href="#n5"><sup class="enote">[5]</sup></a> </p>
<p class="information">
The introductory, maximum section of the PO programme appears
in the Penguin collection of Marx's political writings, <i>The
First International and After,</i> in a translation from the German
text in the <i>Marx-Engels Werke</i>. So far as we know the rest
of the programme has not been published in English before. The
translation which appears here is from the original French version
in Jules Guesde, <i>Textes Choisis, 1867-1882, </i>Editions sociales,
1959, pp.117-9. We are grateful to Bernie Moss for providing a

<h3>The Programme of the Workers Party</h3>
<h3>Preamble</h3>
<p class="fst">
Considering,</p>
<p class="fst">
That the emancipation of the productive class is that of all
human beings without distinction of sex or race;</p>
<p class="fst">
That the producers can be free only when they are in possession
of the means of production <a href="#n9"><sup class="enote">[NB]</sup></a>;</p>
<p class="fst">
That there are only two forms under which the means of production
can belong to them</p>
<ol class="numbered">
<li>The individual form which has never existed in a general
 state and which is increasingly eliminated by industrial progress;</li>
<li>The collective form the material and intellectual elements
 of which are constituted by the very development of capitalist
 society;</li>
</ol>
<p class="fst">
Considering,</p>
<p class="fst">
That this collective appropriation can arise only from the
revolutionary action of the productive class – or proletariat
- organized in a distinct political party;</p>
<p class="fst">
That a such an organization must be pursued by all the means
the proletariat has at its disposal including universal suffrage
which will thus be transformed from the instrument of deception
that it has been until now into an instrument of emancipation;</p>
<p class="fst">
The French socialist workers, in adopting as the aim of their
efforts the political and economic expropriation of the capitalist
class and the return to community of all the means of production,
have decided, as a means of organization and struggle, to enter
the elections with the following immediate demands:</p>
<h3>A. Political Section<a href="#n10"><sup class="enote">[NB2]</sup></a></h3>
<ol class="numbered">
<li>Abolition of all laws over the press, meetings and associations
and above all the law against the International Working Men's
Association. Removal of the livret, 
<a href="#n6"><sup class="enote">[6]</sup></a> that administrative control over the
working class, and of all the articles of the Code 
<a href="#n7"><sup class="enote">[7]</sup></a> establishing the inferiority of the
worker in relation to the boss, and of woman in relation to man;</li>
<li>Removal of the budget of the religious orders and the return
to the nation of the 'goods said to be mortmain, movable and immovable'
(decree by the Commune of 2 April 1871), including all the industrial
and commercial annexes of these corporations;</li>
<li>Suppression of the public debt;</li>
<li>Abolition of standing armies and the general arming of
the people;</li>
<li>The Commune to be master of its administration and its
police.</li>
</ol>
<h3>B. Economic Section</h3>
<ol class="numbered">
<li>One rest day each week or legal ban on employers imposing
work more than six days out of seven. - Legal reduction of the
working day to eight hours for adults. - A ban on children under
fourteen years working in private workshops; and, between fourteen
and sixteen years, reduction of the working day from eight to
six hours;</li>
<li>Protective supervision of apprentices by the workers' organizations;</li>
<li>Legal minimum wage, determined each year according to the
local price of food, by a workers' statistical commission;</li>
<li>Legal prohibition of bosses employing foreign workers at
a wage less than that of French workers;</li>
<li>Equal pay for equal work, for workers of both sexes;</li>
<li>Scientific and professional instruction of all children,
with their maintenance the responsibility of society, represented
by the state and the Commune;</li>
<li>Responsibility of society for the old and the disabled;</li>
<li>Prohibition of all interference by employers in the administration
of workers' friendly societies, provident societies, etc., which
are returned to the exclusive control of the workers;</li>
<li>Responsibility of the bosses in the matter of accidents,
guaranteed by a security paid by the employer into the workers'
funds, and in proportion to the number of workers employed and
the danger that the industry presents;</li>
<li>Intervention by the workers in the special regulations
of the various workshops; an end to the right usurped by the bosses
to impose any penalty on their workers in the form of fines or
withholding of wages (decree by the Commune of 27 April 1871);</li>
<li>Annulment of all the contracts that have alienated public
property (banks, railways, mines, etc.), and the exploitation
of all state-owned workshops to be entrusted to the workers who
work there;</li>
<li>Abolition of all indirect taxes and transformation of
all direct taxes into a progressive tax on incomes over 3,000
francs. Suppression of all inheritance on a collateral line 
<a href="#n8"><sup class="enote">[8]</sup></a> and of
all direct inheritance over 20,000 francs.</li>

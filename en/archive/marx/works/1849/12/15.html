<h5>The Neue Rheinische Zeitung Politisch-Ökonomische Revue<br>
edited by<br>
Karl Marx</h5>
<h5>will appear in January 1850.</h5>
<p>The periodical bears the title of the newspaper of which it is to be considered the continuation. One of its tasks will consist in returning in retrospect to the period which has elapsed since the suppression of the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung.</i></p>
<p>The greatest interest of a newspaper, its daily intervention in the movement and speaking directly from the heart of the movement, its reflecting day-to-day history in all its amplitude, the continuous and impassioned interaction between the people and its daily press, this interest is inevitably lacking in a review. On the other hand, a review provides the advantage of comprehending events in a broader perspective and having to dwell only upon the more important matters. It permits a comprehensive and scientific investigation of the economic conditions which form the foundation of the whole political movement.</p>
<p>A time of apparent calm such as the present must be employed precisely for the purpose of elucidating the period of revolution just experienced, the character of the conflicting parties, and the social conditions which determine the existence and the struggle of these parties.</p>
<p>The review will be published in monthly issues of at least <i>five</i> printers’ sheets at a subscription price of 24 silver groschen per quarter, payable upon delivery of the first issue. Single issues 10 sgr. Messrs. <i>Schuberth</i> and Co., in Hamburg, will attend to retail distribution through <i>bookshops.</i></p>
<p>Friends of the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung </i>are requested to circulate subscription lists in their respective areas and to send them without delay to the undersigned. Literary contributions and likewise news items for discussion in the review will be accepted only post-paid.</p>

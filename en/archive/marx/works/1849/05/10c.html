<h1>The House of Hohenzollern</h1>
<h2>by Karl Marx</h2>
<p class="fst"><b>Cologne, May 9</b> — IN THE LAST DAYS of its and the Prussian state's
existence, the government of Herr von Hohenzollern seems again to verify
fully the old reputation of the Prussian and Hohenzollern name.</p>
<p>Who does not know their character from Heine's poem:</p>
<p class="quoteb">A child with a big pumpkin head,
<br>with long sideburns and gray pigtails,
<br>with spidery-long but strong little arms,
<br>with a gigantic gizzard but short entrails,
<br>A monster ....</p>
<p class="fst">
Who does not know the breaches of faith, the perfidies, the legacy buntings
by which this family of corporals bearing the name of Hohenzollern became
great?</p>
<p>We know how the so-called Great Elector (as if an elector could
be great!) committed his first treachery against Poland in that he, Poland's
ally against Sweden, suddenly went over to the Swedes, the better to plunder
Poland in the Peace of Oliva. <span class="context">[At the Peace of Oliva, concluded between
Sweden on the one side and Poland, Austria, and Brandenburg on the other,
on May 3, 1660, Poland finally relinquished sovereignty over East Prussia.
-- ed.]</span></p>
<p>We know the tasteless figure of Frederick I, the brutal coarseness
of Frederick William I.</p>
<p>We know how Frederick II, the founder of patriarchal despotism,
the friend of the Enlightenment via flogging, auctioned off his country
to the highest-bidding French entrepreneurs. We know how he allied with
Russia and Austria to rape Poland, <span class="context">[In 1772 Poland was first partitioned
between Prussia, Austria, and Russia. — ed.]</span> an act which even now,
after the Revolution of 1848, continues to be an unremoved stain on German
history.</p>
<p>We know how Frederick William II helped to complete the rape of
Poland, when he squandered the usurped Polish national and church estates
on his courtiers.</p>
<p>We know how, in 1792, he formed a coalition with Austria and England
to suppress the glorious French Revolution and to invade France; we also
know how his "splendid army," covered with insult and shame, was driven
out of France.</p>
<p>We know how he then left his allies in the lurch and hastened
to make peace with the French Republic. <span class="context">[In 1795 Prussia and France concluded
a separate peace at Basel. — ed.]</span></p>
<p>We know how he, who used to pretend to enthusiasm for the King
of France and Navarre, bought cheaply from the French Republic this same
King's crown diamonds, and thus profited from the misfortune of his "Beloved
Brother."</p>
<p>We know how he, whose whole life has been a real Hohenzollernish
mixture of luxury and mysticism, of senile lasciviousness and childish
superstition, trampled on freedom of speech in the Bischoffwerder Edicts.
<span class="context">[In the edict on religion, of July 9, 1788, and on censorship, of December
19 1788, issued at the suggestion of Frederick William II's favorite, Johann
Rudolf von Bischoffwerder, religious and press freedom were restricted.
— ed.]</span></p>
<p>We know how his successor, Frederick William III, the "Just,"
betrayed his allies to Napoleon, having been tossed Hanover as bait.</p>
<p>We know how he thereupon immediately betrayed Napoleon to these
quondam allies when he, in the pay of England and Russia, attacked the
French Revolution embodied in the person of Napoleon.</p>
<p>We know what success that attack had: the unheard-of defeat of
the "splendid army" at Jena; the sudden outbreak of a moral lice disease
throughout the Prussian body politic; a series of betrayals, vilenesses,
and cringings on the part of Prussian officials, from whom Napoleon and
his generals turned away in disgust.</p>
<p>We know how, in 1813, Frederick William III, by means of fine
words and splendid promises, brought the Prussian people to the point that
they came to believe in a "war of liberty" against the French, although
what was really involved was a suppression of the French Revolution and
a restoration of the old order by the grace of God.</p>
<p>We know how the fine promises were forgotten as soon as the Holy
Alliance marched into Paris on March 30, 1814.</p>
<p>We know how, by the time of Napoleon's return from Elba, the enthusiasm
of the people was already so cooled that the Hohenzollern had to revive
their extinguished zeal with the promise of a constitution (Edict of May
22, 1815) four weeks before the battle of Waterloo.</p>
<p>We recall the promises of the German Federal Acts and of the Vienna
Curtain Acts: freedom of the press, a constitution, etc. <span class="context">[These Acts
were passed by the Congress of Vienna, in June 1815, confirming German
federal constitutions. — ed.]</span></p>
<p>We know how the "Just" Hohenzollern kept his word: the Holy Alliance
and congresses for the suppression of nations, Carlsbad Decrees, <span class="context">[the
decrees passed by the ministers of the German federal states in August
1819, establishing rigid censorship and surveillance of students and universities.
-- ed.]</span> censorship, police despotism, rule by aristocracy, bureaucratic
arbitrariness, justice by cabinets, demagogic persecutions, mass condemnations,
financial waste — and no constitution.</p>
<p>We know how in 1820 the nation was assured of no increase in taxes
and no rise in the national debt, and how the Hohenzollern kept his word:
expansion of the Maritime Commerce Association into a secret state credit
bank.</p>
<p>We know how the Hohenzollern replied to the appeal of the French
people in the July Revolution: massing troops on the frontier, keeping
down his own people, suppressing the movement in the smaller German states,
and finally enslaving these states under the knout of the Holy Alliance.</p>
<p>We know how this same Hohenzollern violated neutrality in the
Russo-Polish War, letting the Russians pass through his territory and thereby
get at the back of the Poles, putting the Prussian arsenals and magazines
at the disposal of the Russians, offering a secure haven in Prussia to
every defeated Russian army corps. <span class="context">[On January 31, I831, Czar Nicholas
I began a war against Poland, which ended on September 7, 1831, with the
Russian occupation of Warsaw. — ed.]</span></p>
<p>We know that the whole effort of the Hohenzollern Underlord, in
accord with the objectives of the Holy Alliance, was directed at strengthening
the aristocracy, the bureaucracy, and the military in their rule, and suppressing
with brutal force all freedom of expression and all influence of the "limited
intelligence of the subjects" on the government, not only in Prussia but
also in the rest of Germany.</p>
<p>We know that there has rarely been a period when such laudable
intentions have been carried out in a more brutal way than in the period
of Frederick William III, especially between 1815 and 1840. Nowhere have
so many people ever been condemned and sentenced, nowhere have the fortresses
ever been so full of political prisoners, as under the "just" ruler. And
having achieved this, one comes to realize what innocent blockheads these
demagogues were<a id="history">.</a></p>
<p>Shall we revert also to the Hohenzollern who, according to the
Monk of Lehnin, <span class="context">[in the so-called Vaticiniun Lehninense (Lehnin Prophecy),
a monk named Hermann, living in Lehnin, a cloister near Potsdam, prophesied
in the year 1300 the decline of the House of Hohenzollern in the eleventh
generation. — ed.]</span> "would be the last of his race"? Shall we speak
of the rebirth of Christian-Germanic grandeur and the resurrection of pallid
financial distress, of the Order of the Swan, <span class="context">[In 1843 Frederick William
IV vainly tried to restore the knightly Order of the Swan, established
in 1443 — ed.]</span> of the Chief Censorship Court, of the United Diet,
<span class="context">[The first United Diet sat from April 11 to June 26, 1847; it was dissolved
after it would not vote a loan demanded by the King. The second United
Diet, meeting on April 7, 1848, was dissolved on April 10, 1848, after
it voted a loan of 25,000,000 taler. — ed.]</span> of the General Synod,
of the "piece of paper," <span class="context">[in a speech at the opening of the Diet, on
April 11, 1847, Frederick William IV refereed to a constitution as a "piece
of paper." — ed.]</span> of the vain efforts to borrow money, and all the
rest of the achievements of the glorious epoch of 1840-48? Shall we prove
from Hegel that it takes a comedian to see the end of the Hohenzollern
line?</p>
<p>It will not be necessary. The above-mentioned data fully suffices
to characterize the Hohenzollern-Prussian name. It is true that the luster
of this name was dimmed for a moment, but since the Pleiades of Manteuffel
&amp; Co. have surrounded the crown, the ancient grandeur has returned
again. Once more, Prussia is, as of yore, a vice-kingdom under the Russian
suzerainty; once more the Hohenzollern is the underlord of the Autocrat
of all the Russians and the overlord of all the little boyars of Saxony,
Bavaria, Hesse-Homburg, Waldeck, etc.; once more the limited understanding
of the subjects is restored to its old right of obeying orders. "My splendid
army," so long as the Pravoslavny <span class="context">[Orthodox]</span> Czar does not use it himself,
is to restore, in Saxony, Baden, Hesse, and the Palatinate, the kind of
order that has prevailed in Warsaw for eighteen years, and to glue together,
in its own country and in Austria, the cracked crown with the blood of
the subjects. The word spoken in anxiety and in the distress of the heart
concerns us as little as our forefathers resting with God; and as soon
as we are finished at home we will move, with martial music and flying
flags, against France, conquer the country which grows champagne, and destroy
the great Babel, the mother of all sins!</p>
<p>These are the plans of our exalted rulers; this is the haven to
which the noble Hohenzollern is steering us. Hence the piled-up edicts
and strokes of violence; hence the repeated kicks at the cowardly Frankfurt
Assembly; hence the states of siege, the arrests and the persecutions;
hence the invasion of Dresden and South Germany by Prussian soldiery.</p>
<p>But there is still one power, which of course gets little attention
from the gentlemen in Sans Souci, but which nevertheless will speak with
the voice of thunder. The PEOPLE — the people who, in Paris as well as
on the Rhine, in Silesia as well as in Austria, with teeth gnashing in
anger, are awaiting the moment of revolt, and who knows how soon all the
Hohenzollerns and all underlords and overlords will get what they deserve.</p>

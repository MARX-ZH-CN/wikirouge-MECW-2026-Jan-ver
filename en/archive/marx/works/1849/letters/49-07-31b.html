<h4>Paris, end of July 1849</h4>
<p>Dear Weydemeyer,</p>
<p>I have heard from Dronke that it’s no go with the Westphalian lady.  Well, it can’t be helped.</p>
<p>Now I should appreciate your advice as to how best to publish pamphlets.</p>
<p>I should like to start with the pamphlet on <i>wages </i>of which only the beginning appeared in the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung. </i><span class="context">[Wage Labour and Capital]</span><i> </i>I would write a short political foreword to it on the present <i>status quo</i>. Do you think that, e.g., Leske would be agreeable? But he would have to pay, as soon as he had the manuscript in his hands, and pay well, since I know that this pamphlet will attract and will find a mass of subscribers in advance. My present financial condition will not permit me to settle my outstanding account with Leske. <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#276" target=_blank>[276]</a></sup></p>
<p>Were Leske then to find that the thing is well received, we could continue in this way.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had a letter from Engels; he is in Switzerland and, as Willich’s adjutant, has taken part in four encounters.</p>
<p>The sword of Damocles still hangs over my head; my expulsion has neither been rescinded nor, for the moment, is it being enforced.</p>
<p>Awkward though the present state of affairs may be for our personal circumstances, I am nevertheless among the satisfied. Things are going very well and the Waterloo suffered by official democracy may be regarded as a victory.<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#277" target=_blank>[277]</a></sup> ‘Governments by grace of God’ are taking it upon themselves to avenge us on the bourgeoisie, and to chastise them.</p>
<p>One of these days I may perhaps send you a short article for your paper <span class="context">[Neue Deutsche Zeitung]</span> on the state of affairs in England.<sup class="enote"> <a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#278" target=_blank>[278]</a></sup> Just now I find it too boring, having already discussed the matter in a number of private letters.</p>
<p>Write to me <i>direct</i> and to <i>my own</i> address: 45, rue de Lille, Monsieur Ramboz.</p>
<p>My best regards to your wife and yourself from my wife and me. The former very poorly, the natural consequence of her all too interesting condition. Good-bye, my friend, and reply soon.</p>
<p>Your<br>
K. M.</p>

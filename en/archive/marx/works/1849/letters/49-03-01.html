<h4>Cologne, 1 March 1849</h4>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I would have replied to you before now had I not first had to consult various other people about your matter. I do not think it advisable for you to make any sort of public appearance here; out of craving for advancement, the chief of police here is <i>capable de tout</i> as we have experienced only today in the unjustified expulsion of a local Polish refugee. I would further advise you, should your passport not be <i>absolutely impeccable, </i>to choose any route to Paris other than via Cologne and Brussels. You would get through Cologne well enough, but you would undoubtedly he arrested at the Belgian border and transported by prison van to the French border, after having, perhaps, spent several days in prison. I myself experienced this 5 months ago, <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#233" target=_blank>[233]</a></sup> and every day fresh reports reach us of these infamies perpetrated against the refugees by the Belgians. You even run the risk of having all your money taken from you by the scoundrels and not getting a farthing back, as happened to the refugee, von Hochstetter.</p>
<p>If I can be of service to you in any other way, it would be a pleasure.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully<br>
F. Engels</p>

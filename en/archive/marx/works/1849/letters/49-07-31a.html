<h4>Paris, end of July 1849</h4>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>I have suffered a great deal of anxiety on your account and was truly delighted when yesterday I received a letter in your own hand. I had got Dronke (who is here) to write to your brother-in-law asking for news of you. He, of course, knew nothing.</p>
<p>My whole family is here <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#263" target=_blank>[263]</a></sup>; the government wanted to banish me to Morbihan, the Pontine marshes of Brittany.<sup class="enote"> <a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#272" target=_blank>[272]</a></sup> So far I have frustrated their intention. But if I am to write to you in greater detail, both about my own circumstances here and about affairs in general, you must let me have a safer address, for things are really appalling here.</p>
<p>You now have the best opportunity to write a history of or a pamphlet on the Baden-Palatinate revolution. <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#273" target=_blank>[273]</a></sup> Had you not taken part in the actual fighting, we couldn’t have put forward our views about that frolic. It would be a splendid chance for you to define the position of the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> vis-à-vis the democratic party generally. I am positive that the thing will sell and bring you money.</p>
<p>I have embarked on negotiations with a view to starting a politico-economic (monthly) periodical in Berlin which would have to be largely written by us two.<sup class="enote"> <a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#274" target=_blank>[274]</a></sup></p>
<p>Lupus <span class="context">[Wilhelm Wolff]</span> is also in Switzerland, I believe in Berne. Weerth was here yesterday; he is setting up an agency in Liverpool. Red Wolff is living here with me. Finances are, of course, in a state of chaos.</p>
<p>Freiligrath is in Cologne now as heretofore. If my wife were not in an all too interesting condition, I would gladly leave Paris as soon as it was financially possible to do so.</p>
<p>Farewell. Convey my kindest regards to Willich and write by return to the address: M. Ramboz, rue de Lille, 45.</p>
<p>Your<br>
K. M.</p>

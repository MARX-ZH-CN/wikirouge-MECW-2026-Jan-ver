<b>Cologne, January 21.</b> With the sly petty cunning of an experienced
horse-dealer, Montesquieu LVI seeks to sell the "gift horse", the imposed
constitution, to the primary voters. He is the Montesquieu of the horse-fair.

<p>Anyone not wanting the imposed constitution wants a republic,
and not just a republic, but a red republic! Unfortunately, the issue in
our elections is least of all a republic, or a red republic; it is simply
this:

<p>Do you want the old absolutism together with a refurbished system
of social estates, or do you want a bourgeois system of representation?
Do you want a political constitution in keeping with the "existing social
relations" of past centuries, or do you want a political constitution in
keeping with the "existing social relations" of your century?

<p>In this case, therefore, it is least of all a matter of fighting
against bourgeois property relations similar to the struggle that is taking
place in France and is in the offing in England; rather it is a question
of a struggle against a political constitution which endangers "bourgeois
property relations" by surrendering the helm of state to the representatives
of "feudal property relations", to the King by the grace of God, the army,
the bureaucracy, the country squires, and a few financial magnates and
philistines who are allied with them.

<p>Beyond a doubt, the imposed constitution has solved the social
question in keeping with the views of these gentlemen.

<p>What is the "social question" as understood by the civil servant?
It is the maintenance of his salary and his present position, which is
superior to the people.

<p>What is the "social question" as understood by the nobility and
its big landowners? It is the maintenance of the hitherto existing feudal
rights of the landowners, seizure of the most lucrative posts in the army
and civil service by the families of the landed nobility, and finally direct
alms from the public purse. Apart from these palpable material and therefore
"most sacred" interests of the gentlemen "with God for King and Country",
it is for them, of course, also a question of preserving those social privileges
which distinguish their species from the inferior species of the bourgeois,
peasants and plebeians. The old National Assembly was dispersed because
it dared to touch these c 4 most sacred interests". As we have already
indicated, these gentlemen, by "revision" of the imposed constitution,
understand simply the introduction of a system of social estates, that
is to say, a form of political constitution representing the "social" interests
of the feudal aristocracy, the bureaucracy and the monarchy by the grace
of God.

<p>We repeat, there is not the slightest doubt that the imposed constitution
solves the "social question" according to the ideas of the aristocracy
and bureaucracy, in other words, it presents these gentlemen with a form
of government which ensures the exploitation of the people by these demigods.

<p>But has the imposed constitution solved the "social question"
from the standpoint of the bourgeoisie? In other words, does the bourgeoisie
receive a political form enabling it freely to run matters concerning its
class as a whole, i.e., the interests of commerce, industry and agriculture,
to make the most productive use of public funds, to manage the state apparatus
as cheaply as possible, to protect national labor effectively abroad, and
within the country to open up all springs of national wealth silted by
feudal mud?

<p>Does history provide a single example showing that under a king
imposed by the grace of God, the bourgeoisie ever succeeded in attaining
a form of government in keeping with its material interests?

<p>In order to establish a constitutional monarchy it was twice compelled
to get rid of the Stuarts in Britain, and the hereditary Bourbons in France
and to expel William of Orange from Belgium. [158]

<p>What is the reason?

<p>A hereditary king by the grace of God is not a particular individual
but the physical representative of the old society within the new society.
Political power in the hands of a king by the grace of God is political
power in the hands of the old society existing now merely as a ruin; it
is political power in the hands of the feudal estates, whose interests
are profoundly antagonistic to those of the bourgeoisie.

<p>But it is the "King by the grace of God" who forms the basis of
the imposed constitution. 

<p>Just as the feudal strata of society regard the monarchy by divine right
as their political apex, so does the monarchy by divine right regard the
feudal estates as its social foundation, the well-known "monarchical wall".

<p>Therefore, whenever the interests of the feudal lords and of the
army and bureaucracy controlled by them clash with the interests of the
bourgeoisie, the monarchy by divine right will invariably be impelled to
a coup d'etat and a revolutionary or counter-revolutionary crisis will
arise.

<p>Why was the National Assembly ejected? Only because it upheld
the interests of the bourgeoisie as against the interests of feudalism;
because it wanted to abolish feudal relations, which impede agriculture,
to subordinate the army and bureaucracy to trade and industry, to stop
the squandering of public funds and abolish aristocratic and bureaucratic
titles. 

<p>All these matters chiefly and directly affected the interests of the
bourgeoisie. 

<p>Thus, coup d'etats and counter-revolutionary crises are vital to the
existence of the monarchy by the grace of God, which the March and similar
events compelled to eat humble pie and reluctantly to accept a pseudo-bourgeois
monarchy. 

<p>Can credit ever revive again under a form of government whose inevitable
climax are coup d'etats, counter-revolutionary crises and states of siege?

<p>What a delusion!

<p>Bourgeois industry must burst the chains of absolutism and feudalism.
A revolution against both only demonstrates that bourgeois industry has
reached a level when it must either secure an appropriate political form
or perish.

<p>The system of bureaucratic tutelage consolidated by the imposed
constitution spells death for industry. It is sufficient to look at the
Prussian administration of mines, the factory regulations, etc. When an
English manufacturer compares his costs of production. with those of a
Prussian manufacturer, he will always first of all note the time losses
which the Prussian manufacturer incurs because he has to observe bureaucratic
rules.

<p>What sugar-refiner does not remember the Prussian trade agreement
with the Netherlands in 1839? [159] What Prussian factory owner does not
blush at the memory of 1846, when the Prussian government in deference
to the Austrian government banned exports to Galicia for a whole province,
and when one bankruptcy after another occurred in Breslau the Prussian
government declared with astonishment that it had had no idea that so important
an export trade was carried with Galicia, etc.!

<p>Men of the same type are placed at the helm of state by the imposed
constitution, and this "gift" itself comes from the same men. Consequently,
examine it twice.

<p>The Galicia adventure draws our attention to another point.

<p>At that time the counter-revolutionary Prussian government in
league with Austria and Russia sacrificed Silesian industry and Silesian
trade. This maneuver will be constantly repeated. The banker of the Prussian-Austrian-Russian
counter-revolution, from which the monarchy by the grace of God with its
monarchical walls will always have to seek outside support, is England.
The same England is German industry's most dangerous opponent. These two
facts, we believe, speak for themselves.

<p>At home, an industry fettered by bureaucracy and an agriculture
fettered by feudal privileges; abroad, a trade sold by the counter-revolution
to England -- such is the fate of Prussia's national wealth under the aegis
of the imposed constitution.

<p>The report of the "Financial Commission" of the dispersed National
Assembly has thrown sufficient light on the divine management of national
wealth.

<p>The report however mentions only by way of example the sums taken
from the treasury to support the tottering monarchical walls and gild foreign
pretenders to the absolute monarchy (Don Carlos). But this money, purloined
from the pockets of the rest of the citizens to enable the aristocracy
to live in appropriate style and to keep the "pillars" of the feudal monarchy
well buttressed, is only of secondary importance compared with the state
budget imposed simultaneously with Manteuffel's constitution. The main
features of the imposed state budget are, first of all, a strong army to
enable the minority to rule the majority; as large an army as possible
of officials so that as many of them as possible, by virtue of their private
interests, are alienated from the common interest; unproductive employment
of public funds in order that wealth, as the Neue Preussische Zeitung says,
should not make the subjects presumptuous; immobilization wherever possible
of public funds instead of employing them in industry in order that at
predictable moments of crisis the government by divine right independently
confront the people. The basic principle of the imposed Prussian constitution
is to use the taxes for maintaining the state as an oppressive, independent
and sacred force contraposed to industry, commerce and agriculture, instead
of degrading it by turning it into a profane tool of bourgeois society.

<p>The gift is worthy of the donor. The constitution is of a piece
with the present Prussian government that presented it. To get an idea
of this government's hostility towards the bourgeoisie it is sufficient
to point to its proposed trade regulations. On the pretext of advancing
towards association the government attempts to return to the guild system.
Competition compels the manufacturer to produce as cheaply as possible
and therefore on a constantly increasing scale, i.e., with more capital,
with a continuously expanding division of labor and constantly increasing
use of machinery. Every new division of labor depreciates the traditional
skill of the craftsmen, every new machine ousts hundreds of workers, production
on a - larger scale, that. is, with more capital, ruins small trade and
petty-bourgeois enterprise. The government promises to protect the handicrafts
against the factories, acquired skills against division of labor, and small
capital against big capital, by means of feudal guild practices. Thus,
the German nation, particularly the Prussian, which is barely able to withstand
English competition, is to become its defenseless prey, forced to accept
a form of trade organization that is incompatible with modern means of
production and is already burst wide open by modern industry.

<p>We are certainly the last people to desire the rule of the bourgeoisie.
We were the first in Germany to raise our voice against the bourgeoisie
when today's "men of action" were spending their time complacently in petty
squabbles.

<p>But we say to the workers and the petty bourgeois: it is better
to suffer in the contemporary bourgeois society, whose industry creates
the means for the foundation of a new society that will liberate you all,
than to revert to a bygone society, which, on the pretext of saving your
classes, thrusts the entire nation back into medieval barbarism.

<p>But medieval estates and conditions are, as we have seen, the
social foundation of the government by the grace of God. This government
is unsuitable for modern bourgeois society. It necessarily tries to create
a society in its own image. It is entirely consistent, when it attempts
to replace free competition by the guild system, mechanical spinning by
the spinning-wheel and the steam plough by the hoe.

<p>Why is it then that, under these circumstances, the Prussian bourgeoisie,
in contrast to its French, English and Belgian predecessors, proclaims
as its shibboleth the imposed constitution (and with it the monarchy by
divine right, the bureaucracy and the landowning nobility)?

<p>The commercial and industrial sections of the bourgeoisie throw
themselves into the arms of the counter- revolution for fear of the revolution.
As though counter-revolution were not the overture to revolution.

<p>There is moreover a section of the bourgeoisie that, quite indifferent
to the interests of its class as a whole, pursues its own particular interests,
which may even be inimical to those of its class.

<p>These are financial magnates, big creditors of the state, bankers,
and rentiers, whose wealth increases proportionately to the poverty of
the people, and finally men whose business depends on the old political
structure, e.g., Dumont and his literary lumpenproletariat. These are also
ambitious professors, lawyers and similar persons, who can only hope to
obtain respectable posts in a state where betrayal of the people's interests
to the government is a lucrative business.

<p>These are certain manufacturers who do well out of their transactions
with the government; contractors whose considerable profits depend on the
general exploitation of the people; philistines who would lose their importance
if political life were conducted on a larger scale; local councilors who
under cover of the old institutions arrange their private shady affairs
at the expense of the public; oil-merchants who at the price of their betrayal
of the revolution have become Excellencies and Knights of the Eagle; bankrupt
cloth-merchants and speculators in railway-shares who have become royal
bank directors, [160] etc., etc.

<p>"It is they who are the advocates of the imposed constitution."
If the bourgeoisie has a sympathetic heart for these poor brothers and
if it wants to be worthy of the respect of Montesquieu LVI, then it should
elect delegates in keeping with the imposed constitution.

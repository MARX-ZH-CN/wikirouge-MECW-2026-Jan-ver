<b>Cologne, December 31.</b> Never was a revolutionary movement opened
with such an edifying overture as the revolutionary movement of 1848. The
Pope gave it the blessing of the Church, and Lamartine's aeolian harp vibrated
with tender philanthropical tunes on the words of fraternity, the brotherhood
of members of society and nations.

<p class="quoteb">
Welcome all ye myriad creatures!
<br>Brethren, take the kiss of love! [150]

<p class="fst">
Driven out of Rome, the Pope at present is staying at Gaeta under the protection
of the tigerish idiot Ferdinand; Italy's "iniciatore" [151] conspires against
Italy with Austria, Italy's traditional mortal enemy, whom in happier days
he threatened to excommunicate. The recent French presidential elections
have given statistical proof of the unpopularity of Lamartine, the traitor.
There has been no event more philanthropic, humane, and weak than the February
and March revolutions, nothing more brutal than the inevitable consequences
of this humanity of weakness. The proofs are Italy, Poland, Germany, and
above all, those who were defeated in June.

<p>But the defeat of the French workers in June was the defeat of
the June victors themselves. Ledru- Rollin and the other men of the Mountain
[152] were ousted by the party of the National, the party of the bourgeois
republicans; the party of the National was ousted by Thiers-Barrot, the
dynastic opposition; these in turn would have had to make way for the legitimists
if the cycle of the three restorations had not come to an end, and if Louis
Napoleon was something more than an empty ballot-box by means of which
the French peasants announced their entry into the revolutionary social
movement, and the French workers their condemnation of all leaders of the
preceding periods -- Thiers-Barrot, Lamartine and Cavaignac-Marrast. But
let us note the fact that the inevitable consequence of the defeat of the
revolutionary French working class was the defeat of the republican French
bourgeoisie, to which it had just succumbed.

<p>The defeat of the working class in France and the victory of the
French bourgeoisie at the same time signified the renewed suppression of
the nationalities, who had responded to the crowing of the Gallic cock
with heroic attempts to liberate themselves. Prussian, Austrian and English
Sbirri once more plundered, ravished and murdered in Poland, Italy and
Ireland. The defeat of the working class in France and the victory of the
French bourgeoisie was at the same time the defeat of the middle classes
in all European countries where the middle classes, united for the moment
with the people, responded to the crowing of the Gallic cock with sanguinary
insurrections against feudalism. Naples, Vienna, Berlin. The defeat of
the working class in France and the victory of the French bourgeoisie was
at the same time a victory of East over West, the defeat of civilization
by barbarism. The suppression of the Romanians by the Russians and their
tools, the Turks, began in Wallachia; Croats, pandours, Czechs, serezhans
[Mounted troops in the Austrian army who were notorious for their cruelty.
-- Ed.] and similar rabble throttled German liberty in Vienna, and the
Tsar is now omnipresent in Europe. The overthrow of the bourgeoisie in
France, the triumph of the French working class, and the liberation of
the working class in general is therefore the rallying-cry of European
liberation.

<p>But England, the country that turns whole nations into her proletarians,
that spans the whole world with her enormous arms, that has already once
defrayed the cost of a European Restoration, the country in which class
contradictions have reached their most acute and shameless form -- England
seems to be the rock which breaks the revolutionary waves, the country
where the new society is stifled before it is born. England dominates the
world market. Any upheaval in economic relations in any country of the
European continent, in the whole European continent without England, is
a storm in a teacup. Industrial and commercial relations within each nation
are governed by its intercourse with other nations, and depend on its relations
with the world market. But the world market is dominated by England and
England is dominated by the bourgeoisie.

<p>Thus, the liberation of Europe, whether brought about by the struggle
of the oppressed nationalities for their independence or by overthrowing
feudal absolutism, depends on the successful uprising of the French working
class. Every social upheaval in France, however, is bound to be thwarted
by the English bourgeoisie, by Great Britain's industrial and commercial
domination of the world. Every partial social reform in France or on the
European continent as a whole, if designed to be lasting, is merely a pious
wish. Only a world war can break old England, as only this can provide
the Chartists, the party of the organized English workers, with the conditions
for a successful rising against their powerful oppressors. Only when the
Chartists head the English government will the social revolution pass from
the sphere of utopia to that of reality. But any European war in which
England is involved is a world war, waged in Canada and Italy, in the East
Indies and Prussia, in Africa and on the Danube. A European war will be
the first result of a successful workers' revolution in France. England
will head the counter-revolutionary armies, just as she did during the
Napoleonic period, but the war itself will place her at the head of the
revolutionary movement and she will repay the debt she owes to the revolution
of the eighteenth century.

the French working class, world war.

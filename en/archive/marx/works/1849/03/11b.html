<i>Cologne,</i> March 10. The Frankfurt so-called "March Association" <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume09/footnote.html#29" target=_blank>[29]</a></sup> of the Frankfurt so-called "Imperial Assembly" <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume09/footnote.html#30" target=_blank>[30]</a></sup> has had the insolence to send us the following lithographed letter:
</p>
<p class="quote">
"The March Association has decided to compile a list of all newspapers which have given us space in their columns and to distribute it to all associations with which we are connected in order that with the assistance of these associations the newspapers indicated will be given preference in being supplied with any relevant <i>announcements.</i></p>
<p class="quote">
"In informing you herewith of this list, we believe it is unnecessary to draw your attention to the importance of the paid '<i>announcements</i>' of a newspaper as a source of income for the whole enterprise.</p>
<p class="quote">
"Further, the Central March Association has decided to recommend the associations to favour with their support the <i>Teutsches Volksblatt,</i> a democratic-constitutional newspaper appearing in Würzburg, edited by Dr. Eisenmann, in view of the fact that this newspaper is under the threat of succumbing to the competition of anti-democratic newspapers, and the editor has stated that he is not in a position to make further sacrifices over and above those he has already made. Frankfurt, end of February 1849.</p>
<p class="quote">
The Managing Committee of the Central March Association"
</p>
<p>
In the enclosed list of newspapers which "have given space in their columns to the March Association" and to which the supporters of the "March Association" should give preference in supplying "relevant announcements", one finds also the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung,</i> which, in addition, is given the honour of an asterisk.</p><p>
 We hereby announce to all the left-handed and the extreme left-handed members <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume09/footnote.html#31" target=_blank>[31]</a></sup> of this so-called "March Association" of the <i>ci-devant</i> "Imperial Assembly" that the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> has never consented to become the organ of a parliamentary party, least of all of a party of the comical Frankfurt imperial club, that our newspaper has never given space in its columns to the so-called
"March Association" of this club, and that in general the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> has no knowledge of any "March Association". If, therefore, the "March Association" in its lithographed report to those newspapers which have really given it space in their columns designates our newspaper as one of its organs, this is simply calumny against the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> and absurd boasting on the part of the "March Association". No doubt the patriotic upright men of the "March Association" will know how to reconcile this with their "conscience".</p><p>
 The reference of the "March Association" to our newspaper becomes still more ill-mannered owing to the "decision" of the Association to recommend the "democratic-constitutional" newspaper (the Germanic periodical: <i>Teutsches Volksblatt)</i> of "Dr. Eisenmann". Who would not be touched by the sad fate of the great "Germanic" primeval martyr Eisenmann! What upright man will not feel it as a blow that "Dr." Eisenmann, who sold his prison reminiscences to the "democratic-constitutional" King of Bavaria for 12,000 guldens, cannot make "further sacrifices" and is under the threat of succumbing to the publishing "competition" of the ordinary newspapers that are not imposed and that are against the "March Association"? We leave it to the patriots to calculate into what deep neglect the <i>Teutsches Volksblatt</i> must have fallen if Eisenmann, the martyr with 12,000 guldens and deputy with a 5-taler salary, has to appeal for public "support". In any case, things must have gone badly, very badly, with the "democratic-constitutional" Eisenmanns if they produce a fictitious begging letter from the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung,</i> the only newspaper in Germany which has always attacked the "shameless, mean beggars" from among the patriots and imperial-beggarly assemblies.</p><p>
 To the dirty remark of the profit-greedy competition-goaded patriots about "the importance of the paid announcements of a newspaper as a<i> source of income for the whole</i> enterprise", we, of course, do not reply. The <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i> has always differed from the patriots not only generally but also in that it has never regarded political movements as a territory for swindlers or a source of income.

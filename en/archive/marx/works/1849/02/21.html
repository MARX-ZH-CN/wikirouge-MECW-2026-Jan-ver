The Italian Constituent Assembly is quite unlike the Frankfurt National
Assembly. The Italians know that the unity of a country split into feudal
principalities can only be established by abolishing dynastic rule. The
Italians led the dance in 1848, and they are leading again in 1849. But
what progress! Italy no longer has Pius IX nor France her Lamartine. The
fantastic period of the European revolution, the period of enthusiasm,
goodwill and florid orations, was fittingly concluded with fire-balls,
massacres on a grand scale and deportations. Austrian Notes, Prussian Notes
and Russian Notes were the most relevant replies to Lamartine's proclamations.

<p>From their Pythian tripod of thoroughness and perseverance the
Germans are in ' the habit of looking down with haughty disdain on the
superficiality of the Italians. A comparison between the Italian 1848 and
the German 1848 would provide the most striking answer. In drawing this
comparison one would have to take into account that revolutionary Italy
was kept in check by Germany and France, whereas revolutionary Germany
was not restricted in her movements.

<p>The republic in Rome is the beginning of the revolutionary drama
of 1849.

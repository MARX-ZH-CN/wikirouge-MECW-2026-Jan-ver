<h4>[London,] 27 June 1867</h4>
<p><strong>Dear Fred</strong>,</p>
<p>The children send you their best thanks.</p>
<p>I have written to Meissner today that the ‘Leipzig’ method cannot continue in this fashion.  I've had <i>nothing</i> since Monday. The proofs  have been reaching me most irregularly throughout, so that I am for ever being interrupted in other work and am for ever kept quite pointlessly on tenterhooks. Having perhaps received 1 sheet in a whole week, <i>on Saturday</i> <i>evening </i>I at last get a successor which is too late for me to send off. I have written to Meissner that Wigand must send a <i>minimum</i> of 3 sheets <i>on certain agreed days, </i>but that he is always welcome to send <i>more</i> at <strong>anytime</strong>.</p>
<p>If I get 13th and 14th sheets of the corrected copy in time, you shall have them on Sunday. I would have liked you to see my dressing-down of Senior and my introduction to the analysis of the <i>working day</i> before your departure.  Incidentally, the section on the ‘Working Day’ occupies 5 printed sheets, which do, of course, contain predominantly factual material. To show you how closely I have followed your advice in my treatment of the appendix, I'll now copy out for you the divisions, sections, headings, etc., of same appendix.</p>
<h4>Appendix to Chapter I, 1</h4>
<h4>The Form of Value</h4>
<h5>I. Simple Form of Value</h5>
<p>§ 1. The two poles of the expression of value: relative form and equivalent form of value.</p>
<p>a. Inseparability of the two forms.</p>
<p>b. Polarity of the two forms.</p>
<p>c. Relative value and equivalent, both being but forms of value.</p>
<p>§ 2. The relative form of value.</p>
<p>a. The relation of equality.</p>
<p>b. Value-relations.</p>
<p>c. Qualitative content of the relative form of value implied in value-relations.</p>
<p>d. Quantitative determination of the relative form of value implied in value-relations.</p>
<p>e. The relative form of value considered as a whole.</p>
<p>§ 3. The equivalent form.</p>
<p>a. The form of direct exchangeability.</p>
<p>b. Quantitative determination not contained in the equivalent form.</p>
<p>c. The peculiarities of the equivalent form.</p>
<p><span class="greek">a</span>. First peculiarity: use-value becomes the form of appearance of its opposite, value.</p>
<p><span class="greek">b</span>. Second peculiarity: concrete labour becomes the form of appearance of its opposite, abstract human labour.</p>
<p><span class="greek">c</span>. Third peculiarity: private labour takes the form of its opposite, namely, labour in its directly social form.</p>
<p><span class="greek">d</span>. Fourth peculiarity: the fetishism of the commodity-form more striking in the equivalent form than in the relative value-form.</p>
<p>§ 4. The form of value or independent manifestation of value = exchange value.</p>
<p>§ 5. Simple form of value of the commodity-- simple manifestation of the contradictions it contains within itself between use-value and value.</p>
<p>§ 6. Simple form of value of the commodity =simple form of an object as commodity.</p>
<p>§ 7. Relationship between commodity-form and money-form.</p>
<p>§ 8. Simple relative form of value and individual equivalent form.</p>
<p>§ 9. Transition of the simple into the expanded form of value.</p>
<h5>II. Total or Expanded Form of Value</h5>
<p>§ 1. The endless series -of relative expressions of value.</p>
<p>§ 2. Sequential determination implied in the expanded relative form of value.</p>
<p>§ 3. Defects of the expanded relative form of value.</p>
<p>§ 4. Expanded relative form of value and specific equivalent form.</p>
<p>§ 5. Transition to the general form of value.</p>
<h5>III. The General Form of Value</h5>
<p>§ 1. Altered character of the relative form of value.</p>
<p>§ 2. Altered character of the equivalent form.</p>
<p>§ 3. Concurrent development of relative form of value and equivalent form.</p>
<p>§ 4. Development of the polarity between relative form of value and equivalent form.</p>
<p>§ 5. Transition from the general form of value to the money-form.</p>
<h5>IV. The Money-Form</h5>
<p>(The following on the money-form is simply for the sake of continuity — perhaps barely half a page.)</p>
<p>§ 1. How the transition from the general form of value to the money-form differs from the previous transitions in the development. </p>
<p>§ 2. Transformation of the relative form of value into the price form. </p>
<p>§ 3. The simple form of commodity is the secret of the money-form. </p>
<p>You may sprinkle sand on this!</p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. Moro</p>
<p>Don’t forget to drop a line to Borkheim before you depart, so that no ‘misunderstanding’ is possible.</p>
<p>Regarding the <i>English translation</i> <span class="context">[of <i>Capital</i>]</span>, I am trying to track down a fellow in London who will <i>pay decently, </i>so that both Moro as translator and I as author get our due. If I am successful, <strong>Mrs</strong> Lizzy shall also receive her share (you <strong>must in that case</strong> allow me that pleasure — but the bird is not yet in the hand) in the form of a London <strong>dress</strong>. I have some expectations, as Mssrs Harrison et Co. are most desirous to study the book <i>in</i> <i>English.  </i>Eccarius has, of course, told them that he is <strong>a humble</strong> Pupil <strong>of mine — </strong>(his critique of Mill has impressed them hugely, they having previously been believers in Mill) — and that the Prophet Himself is <strong>just now</strong> having the quintessence of all wisdom published, that is printed, in Germany.</p>
<p>I am quite sickened by the <strong>report</strong> on the <strong>Fenians</strong>.  These swine boast of their English humanity in not treating political prisoners <i>worse </i>than murderers, street-thieves, forgers and pederasts! And this O'Donovan Rossa, what ‘<strong>a queer fellow’,</strong> because as a <strong>felony convict</strong> he refused to grovel before his worst enemies! <strong>A queer fellow indeed</strong>! Incidentally, would even the Prussians have been capable of acting in a more bureaucratic fashion than these emissaries of the <strong>weeping willow</strong>, that Knox (read ox) and Pollock (<strong>bull-dog</strong>), who naturally accept the evidence given by the <strong>subordinate ‘warder’ </strong>as unimpeachable. But if you don’t believe the <strong>warders</strong>, you have the word of Wermuth, the chief of police!</p>
<p><strong>Mrs</strong> S O'Donovan Rossa has written the ‘<strong>International’ a very flattering and very graceful letter</strong> on her departure for America.</p>
<p>The fury of that Bismarck-oracle, the <i>Norddeutsche, </i>at Stanley’s and Derby’s statements about the Luxemburg <strong>Treaty</strong> has quite cured my nausea.  That jackass Brass calls it an innovation! Palmerston has <strong>laid down</strong> once and for all the principle that <strong>common treaties</strong> impose only the right and not by any means <i>the </i>duty of intervention <strong>for any state</strong>. And if that were not so, whatever <strong>became</strong> of the <strong>obligations</strong> which England assumed at the Congress of Vienna with regard to <i>Poland</i>, in respect of both Prussia and Russia, and France ditto?</p>

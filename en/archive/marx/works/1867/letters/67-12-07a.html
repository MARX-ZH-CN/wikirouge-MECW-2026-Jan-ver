<h3>Karl Marx to Ludwig Kugelmann, 7 December 1867</h3>

<p class="fst">Dear Kugelmann</p>
<p>Were there six people of your calibre in Germany, the resistance of the philistine mass and the <i>conspiration de silence </i><sup class="enote"><a href="#n1">[1]</a></sup> of the experts and newspaper crowd would have been so far broken down that at least some serious discussion would have begun. <i>Mais il faut attendre! </i><sup class="enote"><a href="#n2">[2]</a></sup> In these words lies the whole secret of <i>Russian policy</i>. I am enclosing a letter (please return it) from a German-Russian worker (a tanner). <sup class="enote"><a href="#n3">[3]</a></sup> Engels remarks, quite rightly, that the autodidactic philosophy  –  pursued by workers themselves  –  has made great progress in the case of this tanner in comparison with the cobbler Jakob Böhm; <sup class="enote"><a href="#n4">[4]</a></sup> also that only ‘German workers’ are capable of such cerebral work.</p>
<p>Borkheim <sup class="enote"><a href="#n5">[5]</a></sup> asked me yesterday who had written the article in the <i>Zukunft </i>(he is a subscriber). It must come from one of our people, since you had sent him a copy of it. I said <i>I did not know</i>. <i>Nota bene! </i>One should not put all one’s cards on the table.</p>
<p>My most cordial thanks to your dear wife for the trouble she took in copying the letter. You should not exploit her so much for ‘surplus labour’.</p>
<p>Bucher, <sup class="enote"><a href="#n6">[6]</a></sup> as, if I am not mistaken, I have already told you, has himself asked me to be the <i>economic correspondent of the Royal Prussian Staatszeitung</i>. So you see that if I <i>wanted </i>to make use of such sources, I could do so without the mediation of a third person.</p>
<p>My illness is the old one  –  nothing dangerous, but troublesome. </p>
<p>With best greetings to your dear wife and Fränzchen.</p>
<p class="sig">Yours<br>
K Marx</p>

<p class="title">Brentano vs Marx, Engels 1891</p>
<h1>II</h1>
<p class="fst">Marx's reply (<i>Der Volksstaat</i>, August 7, 1872, <a href="2-docs.html#d6" target=_blank>Documents,
No. 6</a>) is good-natured enough to deal with all the stir created by
Mr. Brentano about Professor Beesly, <i>The Theory of the Exchanges</i>,
etc.; we leave this aside as being of secondary importance. In conclusion,
however, it produces another two facts which are absolutely decisive for
the main issue. The "lyingly added" passage is to be found, besides in
the <i>Times</i> report, in the reports of two other London morning papers
of April 17, 1863. According to <i>The Morning Star</i>, Gladstone stated:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"This augmentation" -- which had just been described as an intoxicating
augmentation of wealth and power -- "is an augmentation entirely confined
to the classes possessed of property."</p>
<p class="fst">
According to <i>The Morning Advertiser:</i></p>
<p class="quoteb">"The augmentation stated" -- an intoxicating augmentation of wealth
and power -- "is an augmentation entirely confined to the classes possessed
of property."</p>
<p class="fst">
For any other opponent, these proofs would be "absolutely devastating".
Not, however, for the anonymous Brentano. His reply (<i>Concordia</i>,
August 22, 1872, <a href="2-docs.html#d7" target=_blank>Documents,
No. 7</a>), which betrays undiminished impudence, was never seen by Marx,
since numbers of <i>Concordia</i> later than that dated July 11 were not
sent to him. I myself first read this reply in Brentano's reprint (<i>Meine
Polemik, etc.</i>, 1890), and must therefore take note of it here, for
better or for worse.</p>
<p class="quoteb">"The <i>dogged mendacity</i> with which he" (Marx) "clings to the distorted
quotation ... is astonishing even for someone for whom no means are too
base for his subversive plans."</p>
<p class="fst">
The quotation remains "forged", and the <i>Times</i> report "shows the
exact opposite, since <i>The Times</i> and Hansard fully coincide". The
confidence of this declaration is, however, simply child's play compared
to the "impudence" with which Mr. Brentano suddenly gives us the following
information:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"Marx's second method of obscuring the <i>Times</i> report was simply
to suppress, in his German translation, the relative clause which showed
that Gladstone had only said that the augmentation of wealth, which was
shown by the income tax returns, <i>was confined to the classes of property</i>,
since the working classes were not subject to income tax, and that thus
nothing about the increase in the prosperity of the working classes could
be learned from the income tax returns; not, however, that the working
classes in reality had been excluded from the extraordinary augmentation
of national wealth."</p>
<p class="fst">
Thus when <i>The Times</i> says that the oft-mentioned augmentation is
confined to the classes of property, then it says the opposite of the "lyingly
added" sentence, which says the same. As regards the "simply suppressed
relative clause", we shall not allow Mr. Brentano to get away with that,
if he will bear with us for a moment. And now he has happily survived the
first great leap, it is easier for him to assert that black is white, and
white black. Now that he has managed to deal with <i>The Times, The Morning
Star</i> and <i>The Morning Advertiser</i> will give him little trouble.</p>
<p class="quoteb">"For these papers, even as he" (Marx) "quotes them, speak for us. After
Gladstone has said, according to both papers, that he does <i>not</i> believe"
(which, as we know, Mr. Brentano claims) <i>"this</i> intoxicating augmentation
of wealth and power is confined to the classes which find themselves in
pleasant circumstances, he continued: <i>'This</i> great increase of wealth
<i>takes no cognizance at all</i> of the condition of the labouring population.
<i>The augmentation which I have described is an augmentation entirely
confined to the classes possessed of property.'</i> The context and the
use of the expression 'take cognizance' show clearly that this increase
and the augmentation of the increase cited, and the citing," (<i>sic!)</i>
"are intended to indicate those discernible in the income tax returns."</p>
<p class="fst">
The Jesuit who originated the saying <i>Si duo faciunt idem, non est idem</i>
was a bungler compared to the anonymous Brentano. When <i>The Times, The
Morning Star</i> and <i>The Morning Advertiser</i> declare unanimously
that the sentence which Brentano claims Marx had "lyingly added" was actually
uttered by Gladstone, then these papers speak unanimously "for" Mr. Brentano.
And when Marx quotes this sentence verbatim, this is a "lying quotation",
"impudent mendacity , complete forgery", "a lie", etc. And if Marx cannot
appreciate this, that passes the understanding of our Anonymous, alias
Lujo Brentano, and he finds it "simply nefarious".</p>
<p>But let us deal with the alleged "lying addition" once and for
all by quoting the reports on our passage in all London morning papers
on April 17, 1863.</p>
<p>We have already had <i>The Times, The Morning Star</i> and <i>The
Morning Advertiser.</i></p>
<p><i>Daily Telegraph:</i></p>
<p class="quoteb">"I may say for one, that I should look almost with apprehension and
alarm on <i>this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power</i> if it
were my belief that it was confined to the masses who are in easy circumstances.
This question to wealth takes no cognizance at all of the condition of
the labouring population. <i>The augmentation stated is an augmentation
entirely confined to the classes possessed of property."</i></p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Morning Herald:</i></p>
<p class="quoteb">"I may say that I for one would look with fear and apprehension at
<i>this intoxicating increase of wealth</i> if I were of opinion that it
is confined to the classes in easy circumstances. <i>This great increase
of wealth</i> which I have described, and which is founded on accurate
returns <i>is confined entirely to the augmentation of Capital</i>, and
takes no account of the poorer classes."</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Morning Post:</i></p>
<p class="quoteb">"I may say, I for One, would look with fear and apprehension when I
consider this great increase of wealth if I believed that its benefits
were confined to the classes in easy circumstances. <i>This augmentation
of wealth</i> which I have described, and which is founded on accurate
returns <i>is confined entirely to the augmentation of Capital</i>, and
takes no account of the augmentation of wealth of the poorer classes."</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>Daily News:</i></p>
<p class="quoteb">"I may say that I for one would look with fear and apprehension when
I consider <i>this great increase of wealth</i> if I believed that its
benefits were confined to the classes in easy circumstances. <i>This augmentation
of wealth</i> which I have described, and which is founded upon accurate
returns, <i>is confined entirely to the augmentation of Capital</i>, and

<p class="fst">
<i>Standard:</i></p>
<p class="quoteb">"I may say that I for one would look with fear and apprehension at
<i>this intoxicating increase of wealth</i> if I were of the opinion that

<p class="fst">
The eight newspapers cited here were, as far as I know, the only morning
papers published in London at that time. Their testimony is "convincing".
Four of them -- <i>The Times, The Morning Star, The Morning Advertiser,
Daily Telegraph</i> -- give the sentence in exactly the form which Marx
had "lyingly added". The augmentation described earlier as an intoxicating
augmentation of wealth and power <i>"is entirely confined to classes of
property".</i> The four others -- <i>Morning Herald, Morning Post, Daily
News</i> and <i>Standard</i> -- give it in an "only formally more contracted"
version, by which it is further reinforced; this augmentation <i>"is confined
entirely to the augmentation of Capital".</i></p>
<p>The eight newspapers cited all have their separate complete staff
of parliamentary reporters. They are thus the same number of witnesses,
fully independent of one another. In addition they are in their totality
impartial, since they adhere to the most diverse party tendencies. And
both of the two versions of the irrepressible sentence are vouched for
by Tories and Whigs and radicals. According to four of them, Gladstone
said: entirely confined to classes of property. According to four others
he said: entirely confined to the augmentation of Capital. Eight irreproachable
witnesses thus testify that Gladstone really uttered the sentence. The
only question is whether this was in the milder version used by Marx, or
in the stronger version given in four of the reports.</p>
<p>Against them all, in isolated grandeur stands -- Hansard. But
Hansard is not irreproachable like the morning papers. Hansard's reports
are subject to censorship, the censorship of the speakers themselves. And
precisely for this reason "it is the custom to quote according to Hansard.</p>
<p>Eight non-suspect witnesses against one suspect witness! But what
does that worry our victory-confident Anonymous? Precisely <i>because</i>
the reports of the eight morning papers put "that notorious passage" in
Gladstone's mouth, precisely <i>because of this</i>, they "speak for" our
Anonymous, precisely <i>by this</i> they prove even more that Marx "lyingly
added" it.</p>
<p>Indeed, nothing actually exceeds the "impudence" of the anonymous
Brentano.</p>

<p class="title">Brentano vs Marx, Engels 1891</p>
<h1>Preface</h1>
<p class="fst">In my Preface to the fourth edition of the first volume of Marx's <i>Capital</i>
found myself obliged to return to a polemic against Marx, initiated by
Anonymous in the Berlin <i>Concordia</i> in 1872, and taken up again by
Mr. Sedley Taylor of Cambridge in <i>The Times</i> in 1883. Anonymous,
revealed by Mr. Taylor as Mr. Lujo Brentano, had accused Marx of falsifying
a quotation. The short report on the affair which I gave in my Preface
(it is printed amongst the attached <a href="2-docs.html#d12" target=_blank>Documents,
No.12</a>), certainly was not intended to be pleasant to Mr. Brentano;
nothing was more natural than that he should answer me. And this took place
in a pamphlet: <i>Meine Polemik mit Karl Marx. Zugleich em Beitrag zur
Frage des Fortschritts der Arbeiterkiasse und seiner Ursachen.</i> Von
Lujo Brentano, Berlin, Walther &amp; Apolant, 1890.</p>
<p><a id="unions">This pamphlet gives us too much and too little</a>. Too much, because
it "also" gives us at length Mr. Brentano's views on "the advance of the
working class and its causes". These views have absolutely nothing to do
with the point at issue. I remark only this: Mr. Brentano's constantly
repeated declaration that labour protection legislation and trade association
organisations are fitted to improve the condition of the working class
is by no means his own discovery. From the <i>Condition of the Working
Class in England</i> and <i>The Poverty of Philosophy</i> to <i>Capital</i>
and down to my most recent writings, Marx and I have said this a hundred
times, though with very sharp reservations. Firstly, the favourable effects
of the resisting trade associations are confined to periods of average
and brisk business; in periods of stagnation and crisis they regularly
fail; Mr. Brentano's claim that they "are capable of paralysing the fateful
effects of the reserve army" is ridiculous boasting. And secondly — ignoring
other less important reservations -- neither the protection legislation
nor the resistance of the trade associations removes the main thing which
needs abolishing: Capitalist relations, which constantly reproduce the
contradiction between the Capitalist class and the class of wage labourers.
The mass of wage labourers remain condemned to life-long wage labour; the
gap between them and the Capitalists becomes ever deeper and wider the
more modern large-scale industry takes over all branches of production.
But since Mr. Brentano would gladly convert wage-slaves into <i>contented</i>
wage-slaves, he must hugely exaggerate the advantageous effects of labour
protection, the resistance of trade associations, social piecemeal legislation,
etc.; and as we are able to confront these exaggerations with the simple
facts -- hence his fury.</p>
<p>The pamphlet in question gives too little, since it gives, of
the documents in the polemic, only the items exchanged between Mr. Brentano
and Marx, and not those which have appeared since with regard to this question.
So in order to place the reader in a position to form an overall judgement,
I give, in the appendix: 1. the incriminated passages from the Inaugural
Address of the General Council of the International and from <i>Capital</i>;
2. the polemic between Mr. Brentano and Marx; 3. that between Mr. Sedley
Taylor and Eleanor Marx; 4. my Preface to the 4th edition of <i>Capital</i>
and Mr. Brentano's reply to it; and 5. passages relevant to Gladstone's
letters to Mr. Brentano. It goes without saying that I thereby omit all
those passages of Brentano's argument which do not touch upon the question
of falsification of quotation, but only constitute his "contribution to
the advance", etc.</p>

<p class="title">Brentano vs Marx, Engels 1891</p>
<h1>IV</h1>
<p class="fst">Here ends the first act of our song and dance. Mr.
Brentano, mysterious though not yet a privy councillor, [Play on words:
"geheimnisvoll" -- mysterious, "Geheimrat" -- privy councillor.-- <i>Trans</i>]
had achieved what he could scarcely have hoped to achieve. Admittedly,
things had gone badly enough for him regarding the sentence allegedly "lyingly
added"; and in fact he had dropped this original charge. But he had sought
out a new line of defence, and on this line -- he <i>had had the last word</i>,
and with that you can, in the world of German professordom, claim you have
stood your ground. And with this he could brag, at least amongst his own,
that he had victoriously repelled Marx's onslaught, and slain Marx himself
in the literary world. The luckless Marx, however, never heard a dying
word about his slaughter in the <i>Concordia</i>; on the contrary, he had
the "impudence" to live on for another eleven years, eleven years of mounting
success for him, eleven years of uninterrupted growth in the numerical
strength of his supporters in all countries, eleven years of constantly
growing recognition of his merits.</p>
<p>Mr. Brentano and consorts wisely refrained from freeing the blinded
Marx of his self-deception, or making it clear to him that he had actually
been dead for a long time. But after he really did die in 1883, they could
no longer contain themselves, their fingers itched too much. And now Mr.
Sedley Taylor appeared on the scene, with a letter to <i>The Times</i>
(<a href="2-docs.html#d8" target=_blank>Documents, No. 8</a>).</p>
<p>He provoked things himself, if he or his friend Brentano, as it
almost appears, had not actually concocted it with M. Émile de Laveleye
[see É. de Laveleye, "To the Editor of <i>The Times</i>, Liège,
November 16". <i>The Times</i>, No. 30987, November 26, 1883. -- <i>MECW
Ed</i>]. In that stilted style which betrays a certain recognition of his
dubious cause, he states that it appears to him</p>
<p class="quoteb">"extremely singular that it was reserved for Professor Brentano to
expose, eight years later, the <i>mala fides"</i> of Marx.</p>
<p class="fst">
And then begin the vainglorious phrases about the masterly conduct of the
attack by the godlike Brentano, and the speedily ensuring deadly shifts
of the notorious Marx, etc. What things were like in reality our readers
have already seen. All that fell into deadly shifts was only Brentano's
claim about the lying addition of the sentence in question.</p>
<p>And finally in conclusion:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"On Brentano's showing, by a detailed comparison of texts, that the
reports of <i>The Times</i> and of "Hansard" agreed in utterly excluding
the meaning which craftily isolated quotation had put upon Mr. Gladstone's
words, Marx withdrew from further controversy under the plea of want of
time!"</p>
<p class="fst">
The "detailed comparison of texts" is simply farcical. Anonymous Brentano
quotes <i>only</i> Hansard. Marx supplies him with the <i>Times</i> report,
which includes verbatim the controversial sentence missing in Hansard.
Mr. Brentano now also quoted the <i>Times</i> report, and this three lines
further than Marx quoted it. These three lines are supposed to show that
<i>The Times</i> and Hansard fully agree, and thus that the sentence allegedly
"lyingly added" by Marx is <i>not</i> in the <i>Times</i> report, although
it stands there word for word; or at the very least, if it should stand
there, that it then means the opposite of what it says in plain words.
Mr. Taylor calls this daredevil operation a "detailed comparison of texts".</p>
<p>Further. It is simply not true that Marx then withdrew under the
plea of want of time. And Mr. Sedley Taylor knew this, or it was his business
to know it. We have seen that before this Marx delivered proof to the anonymous
godlike Brentano that the reports in <i>The Morning Star</i> and <i>The
Morning Advertiser</i> also contained the "lyingly added" sentence. Only
after this did he declare that he could waste no more time on Anonymous.</p>
<p>The further polemic between Mr. Sedley Taylor and Eleanor Marx
(Documents, Nos <a href="2-docs.html#d9" target=_blank>9</a>,
<a href="2-docs.html#d10" target=_blank>10</a> and <a href="2-docs.html#d11" target=_blank>11</a>) showed in
the first place that he did not try for a moment to maintain the original
charge about the lying addition of a sentence. He went so far as to claim
that this was "of very subordinate importance." Once again the direct
disavowal of a fact which he knew, or which it was his business to know.</p>
<p>In any case we take note of his admission that this charge does
not hold water, and congratulate his friend Brentano on this.</p>
<p>So what is the charge now? Simply that of Mr. Brentano's second
line of defence that Marx had wished to distort the sense of Gladstone's
speech -- a new charge of which, as we have noted, Marx never knew anything.
In any case, this brings us to a completely different field. What was concerned
to begin with was a definite fact: did Marx lyingly add this sentence or
not? It is now no longer denied that Marx victoriously rebuffed this charge.
The new charge of distorted quotation, however, leads us into the field
of subjective opinions, which necessarily vary. <i>De gustibus non est
disputandum.</i> [There can be no argument about taste. -- <i>MECW Ed</i>.]
One person may regard as unimportant -- intrinsically or for the purpose
of quotation -- something which another person declares to be important
and decisive. The conservative will [never] quote acceptably for the liberal,
the liberal never for the conservative, the socialist never for one of
them or both of them. The party man whose own comrade is quoted against
him by an opponent regularly discovers that the essential passage, the
passage determining the real sense, has been omitted in quotation. This
is such an everyday occurrence, something permitting so many individual
viewpoints, that nobody attaches the slightest significance to such charges.
Had Mr. Brentano utilised his anonimity to level this charge, and this
charge alone, against Marx, then Marx would scarcely have regarded it as
worth the trouble of a single word in reply.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish this new twist with that elegance peculiar
to him alone, Mr. Sedley Taylor finds it necessary to repudiate thrice
his friend and comrade Brentano. He repudiates him first when he drops
his originally sole charge of "lying addition", and even denies its existence
as original and sole. He repudiates him further when he summarily discards
the infallible Hansard, to quote exclusively from which is the "custom"
of the ethical Brentano, [Play on words: "Sitte" -- custom, "sittlich"
-- ethical.-- <i>MECW Ed.</i>] and uses instead the <i>Times</i> report,
which the selfsame Brentano calls "necessarily bungling". Thirdly, he repudiates
him, and his own first letter to <i>The Times</i> into the bargain, by
seeking the "quotation in dispute" no longer in the Inaugural Address but
in <i>Capital</i> And this for the simple reason that he had never laid
his hand upon the Inaugural Address, to which he "had the hardihood" to
refer in his letter to <i>The Times!</i></p>
<p>Shortly after his controversy with Eleanor Marx he vainly sought
this Address in the British Museum, and was introduced there to his opponent,
whom he asked whether <i>she</i> could not obtain a copy for him. Whereupon,
I sought out a copy amongst my papers, and Eleanor sent it to him. The
"detailed comparison of texts" which this enabled him to make apparently
convinced him that silence was the best reply.</p>
<p>And in fact it would be superfluous to add a single word to Eleanor
Marx's retort (<a href="2-docs.html#d11" target=_blank>Documents, No. 11</a>)</p>

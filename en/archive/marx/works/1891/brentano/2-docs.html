<h3>I. The Incriminated Quotations</h3>
<p class="fst">
The original edition is entitled: "Address and Provisional Rules of the
Working Men's International Association, established September 28, 1864,
at a Public Meeting held at St. Martin's Hall, Long Acre, London." Price
one penny. Printed at the "Bee-Hive" Newspaper Office, 10, Bolt Court,
Fleet Street, 1864. * The address begins: "It is a great fact that the
misery of the working masses has not diminished from 1848 to 1864, and
yet this period is unrivalled for the development of its industry and the
growth of its commerce." By way of proof, facts are quoted from the <i>PUBLIC
HEALTH Reports</i> about the poor nutrition of various groups of urban
workers and agricultural day labourers in the country. It then continues:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"Such are the official statements published by order of Parliament
in 1864, during the millennium of free trade, at a time when the Chancellor
of the Exchequer told the House of Commons that</p>
<p class="quoteb" style="margin-left: 100px;">
"'the average condition of the British labourer has improved in a degree
we know to be extraordinary and unexampled in the history of any country
or any age.'</p>
<p class="quoteb">
"Upon these official congratulations jars the dry remark of the official
<i>Public Health Report:</i></p>
<p class="quoteb">"'The public health of a country means the health of its masses, and
the masses will scarcely be healthy unless, to their very base, they be
at least moderately prosperous.'</p>
<p class="quoteb">
"Dazzled by the 'Progress of the Nation' statistics dancing before his
eyes, the Chancellor of the Exchequer exclaims in wild ecstasy:</p>
<p class="quoteb">'From 1842 to 1852 the taxable income of the country increased by 6
per cent; in the eight years from 1853 to 1861, it has increased from the
basis taken in 1853, 20 per cent! The fact is so astonishing as to be almost
incredible!... This intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power,' adds
Mr. Gladstone, 'is entirely confined to classes of property.'" *</p>

CAPITAL</h3>
<h4>MARX, <i>CAPITAL</i>, VOLUME 1, 3RD EDITION, pp. 670-672</h4>
<p class="fst">After these few examples one understands the cry of triumph of the Registrar-General
of the British people:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"Rapidly as the population has increased, it has not kept pace with
the progress of industry and wealth." [101]</p>
<p class="fst">
Let us turn now to the direct agents of this industry, or the producers
of this wealth, to the working class.</p>
<p class="quoteb">"It is one of the most melancholy features in the social state of this
country," says Gladstone, "that while there was a decrease in the consuming
power of the people, and while there was an increase in the privations
and distress of the labouring class and operatives, there was at the same
time a constant accumulation of wealth in the upper classes, and a constant
increase of Capital." [102]</p>
<p class="fst">
Thus spoke this unctuous minister in the House of Commons of February 13th,
1843. On April 16th, 1863, 20 years later, in the speech in which he introduced
his Budget:

<p class="quoteb">"From 1842 to 1852 the taxable income of the country increased by 6
per cent.... In the 8 years from 1853 to 1861, it had increased from the
basis taken in 1853, by 20 per cent! The fact is so astonishing as to be
almost incredible ... this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power
... entirely confined to classes of property ... must be of indirect benefit
to the labouring population because it cheapens the commodities of general
consumption. While the rich have been growing richer, the poor have been
growing less poor. At any rate, whether the extremes of poverty are less,
I do not presume to say." [104]

<p class="fst">
How lame an anti-climax! If the working class has remained "poor", only
"less poor" in proportion as it produces for the wealthy class "an intoxicating
augmentation of wealth and power", then it has remained relatively just
as poor. If the extremes of poverty have not lessened, they have increased,
because the extremes of wealth have. As to the cheapening of the means
of subsistence, the official statistics, e. g. the accounts of the LONDON
ORPHAN ASYLUM, show an increase in price of 20% for the average of the
three years 1860-1862, compared with 1851-1853. In the following three
years, 1863-1865, there was a progressive rise in the price of meat, butter,
milk,, sugar, salt, coals, and a number of other necessary means of subsistence.
Gladstone's next budget speech of April 7th, 1864, is a Pindaric dithyrambus
on the advance of surplus-value-making and the happiness of the people
"tempered by poverty". He speaks of masses "on the border of pauperism",
of branches of trade in which "wages have not increased", and finally sums
up the happiness of the working-class in the words: "human life is but,
in nine cases out of ten, a struggle for existence". Professor Fawcett,
not bound like Gladstone by official considerations, declares roundly:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"I do not, of course, deny that money wages have been augmented by
this increase of Capital" (in the last ten years), "but this apparent advantage
is to a great extent lost, because many of the necessaries of life are
becoming dearer" (he believes because of the fall in value of the precious
metals) "...THE RICH GROW RAPIDLY RICHER, whilst there is no perceptible
advance in the comfort enjoyed by the industrial classes.... They (the
labourers) become almost the slaves of the tradesman, to whom they owe
money.")</p>
<p class="fst">

STATISTICS OF THE UN. KINGDOM", PART VI, LONDON, 1866, pp. 260-273, passim.
An addition to the second edition. Instead of the statistics of orphan
asylums &amp;c., the declamations of the ministerial journals in recommending
dowries for the Royal children might also serve. The greater dearness of
the means of subsistence 15 never forgotten there.</p>

REGION (PAUPERISM)", "WAGES... IN OTHERS NOT INCREASED ... HUMAN LIFE IS

OF COMMONS, 7th April, 1864). The continual crying contradictions in Gladstone's
budget speeches of 1863 and 1864 were characterised by an English writer
by the following quotation from Molière:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"Voila' l'homme en effet. Il va du blanc au noir.

<i>How Karl Marx Quotes</i></h4>
<p class="fst">
The following passage may be found in the Inaugural Address [<i>note by
Brentano</i>: Reprinted in the <i>Volksstaat</i>, No. 5 of January 17,
1872] of the International Working Men's Association written by Karl Marx.</p>
<p class="quoteb">"Dazzled by the 'Progress of the Nation' statistics dancing before
his eyes, the Chancellor of the Exchequer exclaims in wild ecstasy: 'From
1842 to 1852 the taxable income of the country increased by 6 per cent;
in the eight years from 1853 to 1861, it has increased from the basis taken
in 1853,20 per cent! The fact is so astonishing as to be almost incredible!...
<i>This intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power,' adds Mr. Gladstone,
'is entirely confined to classes of property.'"</i></p>
<p class="fst">
This quotation by Marx has become famous. We have discovered it in a considerable
number of writings. However, the authors rarely quoted the Inaugural Address
of the International as the source upon which they had drawn. They inferred
that they had themselves read Gladstone's budget speech. To what extent
this was the case may be seen from the following comparison with Gladstone's
speech (see Hansard, <i>Parliamentary Debates</i>, 3rd Series, Vol. 170,
p.243 ff.):</p>
<p class="quoteb">"The Income Tax, at <i>7d.</i> in the pound, in the year 1842 3, attaching
to Great Britain only, and in Great Britain only to incomes of £150
and upwards, was assessed upon an aggregate amount of income in the schedules
I have named reaching £156,000,000. Upon the very same area, with
the same limitations, in 1860-1 the amount of assessed income was £221,000,000.
Further, I am not aware that there has been any change in the machinery
of the tax, or any improvement in the powers of levying the tax, as compared
with the powers of escaping it, that will in any way account for the difference.
On the contrary, certain concessions and relaxations have from time to
time been enacted by the Legislature, which, as far as they go, would rather
tell in the opposite direction. The difference, however, amounts to no
less than £65,000,000 of annual income, or two-sevenths of the whole
annual taxable income of the country within the area described. That is
a most remarkable result; but there is a certain feature of that result
which, when carefully examined, is yet more remarkable; and that is the
accelerated rate of increase in the latter portion of that period. I again
invite the attention of the Committee for a few minutes. I compare two
periods -- one of them before 1853, and the other since 1853, the year
when the basis was altered. In eight years from 1842 to 1852 inclusive,
the liable to tax income of the country, as nearly as we can make out,
increased by 6 per cent; but in eight years, from 1853 to 1861, the income
of the country again increased upon the basis taken by 20 per cent. That
is a fact so singular and striking as to seem almost incredible. [...]</p>
<p class="quoteb">"Such, Sir, is the State of the case as regards the general progress
of accumulation; but, for one, <i>I must say that</i> I <i>should look
with some degree of pain, and with much apprehension, upon this extraordinary
and almost intoxicating growth, if it were my belief that it is confined
to the class of persons who may be described as in easy circumstances</i>
The figures which I have quoted take little or no cognizance of the condition
of those who do not pay income tax; or, in other words, sufficiently accurate
for general truth, they do not take cognizance of the property of the labouring
population, or of the increase of its income. Indirectly, indeed, the mere
augmentation of Capital is of the utmost advantage to the labouring class,
because that augmentation cheapens the commodity which in the whole business
of production comes into direct competition with labour. <i>But, besides
this, a snare direct and a larger benefit has, it may safely be asserted,
been conferred upon the mass of the people of the country. It is matter
of profound and inestimable consolation to reflect, that while the rich
have been growing richer, the poor have become less poor.</i> I will not
presume to determine whether the wide interval which separates the extremes
of wealth and poverty is less or more wide than it has been in former times.
<i>But if we look to the average condition of the British labourer</i>,
whether peasant, or miner, or operative, or <b>artisan, we know from varied
and indubitable evidence that during the last twenty years such an addition
has been made to his means of subsistence as we may almost pronounce to
be without example in the history of any country and of any age."</b></p>
<p class="fst">
What is the relationship between this speech and the quotation by Marx?
Gladstone first makes the point that there has undoubtedly been a colossal
increase in the income of the country. This is proved for him by the income
tax. But income tax takes notice only of incomes of 150 pounds sterling
and over. Persons with lower incomes pay no income tax in England. The
fact that Gladstone mentions this so that his yardstick can be properly
appreciated is utilised by Marx to have Gladstone say: <i>"This intoxicating
augmentation of wealth and power is entirely confined to classes of property."</i>
Yet this sentence is nowhere to be found in Gladstone's speech. It says
quite the opposite. Marx has added the <i>sentence lyingly, both in form
and in content!</i></p>

Karl Marx's Reply</h3>
<h4><i>Der Volksstaat</i>, No. 44. Saturday, June 1, 1872</h4>
<p class="fst">
A friend has sent me, from Germany, <i>Concordia. Zeitschrift für
die Arbeiterfrage</i>, No. 10, dated March 7, in which this "organ of the
German Manufacturers' Association" publishes an editorial entitled <i>"How
Karl Marx Quotes".</i></p>
<p>In the Inaugural Address of the International Working Men's Association
I quote, amongst other material, a portion of</p>
<p>Gladstone's budget speech of April 16, 1863, which is not contained
in Hansard's semi-official report of parliamentary debates. On this basis,
with comfortable manufacturers' logic the <i>Concordia</i> concludes: "This
sentence is nowhere to be found in Gladstone's speech", and jubilates in
the fullness of its heart with this mocking sentence in manufacturers'
German, printed in mocking bold face:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><b>"Marx has added the sentence lyingly, both in form and in content!"</b></p>
<p class="fst">
It would, in fact, be extremely strange if the Inaugural Address, originally
printed in English in London under Gladstone's very eyes, had placed in
his mouth a sentence interpolated by me, a sentence that, for seven and
a half years, circulated unchallenged in the London press, to be finally
detected by the "learned men" of the German Manufacturers' Association
in Berlin.</p>
<p>The sentence in question of the Inaugural Address reads as follows:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"This intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power is entirely confined
to classes of property" (p.6, Inaugural Address etc.). (In the German translation
literally: )</p>
<p class="fst">
In an article in <i>The Fortnightly Review</i> (November 1870), which attracted
great attention and was discussed by all the London press, Mr. Beesly,
Professor of History at the university here, quoted as follows, p. 518:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>"An intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power, as Mr. Gladstone
observed, entirely confined to classes of property."</i> (In the German
translation: )</p>
<p class="fst">
Yet Professor Beesly's article appeared six years later than the Inaugural
Address! Good! Let us now take a specialised publication, intended solely
for the City and published not only <i>before</i> the appearance of <i>the
Inaugural Address</i>, but even <i>before the International Working Men's
Association was founded</i> It is entitled: <i>The Theory of Exchanges.
The Bank Charter Act of 1844</i> London 1864, published by T. Cautley Newby,
30, Welbeck Street. It examines Gladstone's budget speech at length and
p. 134 gives the following quotation from this speech:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"This intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power is entirely confined
to classes of property." (In the German translation: ...)</p>
<p class="fst">
That is, word for word, exactly what I quoted.</p>
<p>This proves irrefutably that the German Manufacturers' Association
<i>"lied both in form and in content"</i> in decrying this "sentence as
a fabrication "by me"!</p>
<p>Incidentally: honest old <i>Concordia</i> printed in bold face
another passage, in which Gladstone prattled about an elevation of the
English working class, over the last 20 years, that was supposedly "extraordinary
and unparalleled in all countries and in all periods". The bold-face type
is supposed to indicate that I had suppressed this passage. On the contrary!
In the Inaugural Address I emphasised most strongly the screaming contrast
between this shameless phrase and the "APPALLING STATISTICS" as Professor
Beesly rightly calls them, contained in the official English reports on
the same period. [<i>Marx note</i>: Other whimsical apologetics from the
same speech are dealt with in my work <i>Capital</i> (p.638, 639).]</p>
<p>The author of <i>The Theory of the Exchanges</i> quoted, like
myself, not from Hansard, but from a London newspaper which, on April 17,
published the April 16 budget speech. In my collectanea of cuttings for
1863, I have searched in vain for the relevant extract and thus, also,
for the name of the newspaper that published it. This is, however, not
important. Although the parliamentary reports of the London newspapers
always differ from one another, I was certain that none of them could completely
suppress such a striking quotation from Gladstone. So I consulted <i>The
Times</i> of April 17, 1863 -- it was then, as now, Gladstone's organ --
and there I found, on p.7, column 5, in the report on the budget speech:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"That is the state of the case as regards the <i>wealth of this country.</i>
I must say for one, I should look almost with apprehension and with pain
upon <i>this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power</i>, if it were
my belief that it was confined to <i>classes who are in easy circumstances.</i>
[<i>Marx note</i>: The words "EASY CLASSES", "CLASSES IN EASY CIRCUMSTANCES"
were apparently first introduced <i>by Wakefield</i> for the really rich
portion of the propertied class.] This takes no cognizance at all of the
condition of the labouring population. <i>The augmentation I have described</i>,
and which is founded, I think, upon accurate returns. n <i>an augmentation
entirely confined to classes of property."</i></p>
<p class="fst">
In the German translation: ...</p>
<p>So, on April 16, 1863, Mr. Gladstone declared <i>"both in form
and in content"</i> in the House of Commons, as reported in his own organ,
<i>The Times</i>, on April 17, 1863 that <i>"this intoxicating augmentation
of wealth and power is entirely confined to the classes possessed of property"</i>,
and his apprehension gives him a sort of shiver, but only because of his
scruples that this was confined to one part of this class, the part in
really easy circumstances.</p>
<p><i>Italiam, Italiam!</i> Finally we arrive at <i>Hansard</i> In
its edition, here botchily corrected, Mr. Gladstone was bright enough clumsily
to excise the passage that would be, after all, compromising on the lips
of an English Chancellor of the Exchequer. This is, incidentally, traditional
English parliamentary practice, and by no means the invention of little
Lasker versus Bebel. A careful comparison of Gladstone's speech itself,
as it appeared in <i>The Times</i>, and its subsequent form, as distorted
by the same Gladstone, would provide an amusing description of this unctuous,
phrase-mongering, quibbling and strictly-religious bourgeois hero, who
timidly displays his piousness and his liberal "ATTITUDES OF MIND".</p>
<p>One of the most infuriating things in my work <i>Capital</i> consists
in the masses of official proof describing how manufacturers work, something
in which no scholar could previously find a thing wrong. In the form of
a rumour this even reached the ears of the gentlemen of the German Manufacturers'
Association, but they thought:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"Was kein Verstand der Verstländigen sieht,
<br>Das über in Einfalt ein kindlich' Gemüt."</p>
<p class="fst">
No sooner said than done. They find a suspicious-looking quotation in the
Inaugural Address and turn for information to a business friend in London,
the first best Mundella, and he, being a manufacturer himself, rushes to
despatch overseas, in black and white, the extract from Hansard's Parliamentary
Debates. Now they have my fabrication secret. I manufacture not only the
text, but the quotations too. Drunk with victory, they trumpet out to the
world <i>"How Karl Marx Quotes!"</i> So my wares were discredited, once
and for all, and, as is fitting for manufacturers, in the way of normal
business, without the expense of Teamed men.</p>
<p>The irksome subsequent events will perhaps teach the Manufacturing
Associates that, however well they may know how to forge goods, they are
as well fitted to judge literary goods as a donkey is to play the lute.</p>

RETORT BY ANONYMOUS</h3>
<h4><i>CONCORDIA</i>, No. 27, July 4, 1872<br>
<i>HOW KARL MARX DEFENDS HIMSELF</i></h4>
<h5>I</h5>
<p class="fst">
Our readers will perhaps recall the article "How Karl Marx Quotes" in No.
10 of this paper on March 7 this year. In it we dealt with a passage from
the Inaugural Address of the International, written by Karl Marx, a passage
which has won a certain fame and is frequently quoted by the Social Democrats
as convincing proof of the irrevocable ruin of the working class should
the state and social conditions of today persist. Here Marx quotes Gladstone's
budget speech of April 16, 1863. In this speeds Gladstone first notes that
there has been "an extraordinary and almost intoxicating growth" of the
income of the country, and he uses the increase in income tax [revenue]
to prove this. But the figures he quotes for this purpose "take little
or no cognizance of the condition of those who do not pay income tax";
they "do not take cognizance of the property of the labouring population,
or of the increase of its income". Persons with an income under 150 pounds
sterling, in fact, pay no income tax in England. And the fact that Gladstone
had mentioned this to allow a proper appreciation of his yardstick was
utilised by Marx in order to have Gladstone say: "This intoxicating augmentation
of wealth and power is entirely confined to classes of property. However,
this sentence is nowhere to be found in Gladstone's speech. On the contrary,
Gladstone said that he did <i>not</i> believe this augmentation "had been
confined to the class of persons who may be described as in easy circumstances".
And indignant at the impudence with which Marx quoted distortingly, we
exclaimed: "Marx has added the sentence lyingly, both in form and in content!"</p>
<p>This was a serious charge; combined with the convincing evidence
provided, it was absolutely devastating for the widespread trust amongst
our Social Democrats in the unparalleled and thorough learnedness, truthfulness
and infallibility of the London oracle. It could therefore not be allowed
to pass without a refutation, or at least something which looked like a
refutation. In number 44 of the <i>Volksstaat</i> dated June l, * Marx
attempted to give such a refutation. But our opponent has by no means been
able to wash himself clean of the charge of <i>mala fides</i> in his quotations.
In fact, the ways and means of his defence are more suitable than anything
to prove his <i>mala fides.</i> The brazenness, namely, with which he once
again abuses the fact that the readers of the <i>Volksstaat</i> have no
possibility of checking his claims, this brazenness even exceeds his frivolity
in quotation.</p>
<p>* [Brentano note: That is almost a full three months after the
article appeared in the <i>Concordia</i> Despite this, the <i>Volksstaat</i>
was impudent enough scarcely 14 days after carrying Marx's rebuttal to
accuse us of "heroically silencing" this rebuttal. We believe that the
<i>Volksstaat</i> had no reason to press so hard for the second, and sharper,
treatment of its lord and master. Incidentally, the reason for the delay
in our reply is partly due to the fact that one of the sources cited by
Marx was not available here and had to be obtained from England, partly
to the fact that the elucidation of this quotation demanded lengthy extracts
from the relevant sources and consequently the above article became unusually
long, so that, for reasons of space, we were obliged to postpone publication
several times. <i>The editors of the "Concordia".</i>]</p>
<p>Marx naturally does not go so far as to challenge the correctness
of our quotation from the shorthand report of Parliament. His immediate
aim is to prove his <i>bona fides</i> in quotation, and to this end he
refers to the fact that others have quoted like he did. He writes:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"In an article in <i>The Fortnightly Review</i> (November 1870), which
attracted great attention and was discussed by all the London press, Mr.
Beesly, Professor of History at the university here, quoted as follows,
p. 518: 'An intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power, as Mr. Gladstone
observed, entirely confined to classes of property.' -- Yet Professor Beesly's
article appeared six years later than the Inaugural Address!"</p>
<p class="fst">
Quite right! Only the addition of another "yet" has been forgotten. This
article by Professor Beesly deals, in fact, with the history of the International,
and as the author himself informs every enquirer, was written on the basis
of material provided him by Marx. And there is still more. At this point
it is not Beesly who is quoting Gladstone at all; he is merely saying that
the Inaugural Address of the International contains this quotation. "From
this alarming statistics," Beesly writes, "the <i>Address</i> turns to
the income-tax returns, which show that the taxable incomes of the country
have increased by 20% in eight years, 'an intoxicating augmentation of
wealth and power', as Mr. Gladstone observed, entirely confined" etc. --
A fine way of proof indeed! You trick some person who does not know your
dishonesty into accepting a lying statement; this person repeats it in
good faith; and then you cite this and the honesty of the person who repeated
the statement in order to prove the correctness of the statement and your
own honesty. -- Marx continues his defence:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"Let us now take a specialised publication, intended solely for the
City and published not only before the appearance of the Inaugural Address,
but even before International Working Men's Association was founded. It
is entitled: <i>The Theory of Exchanges. The Bank Charter Act of 1844</i>,
London 1864, published by T. Cautley Newby, 30, Welbeck Street. It examines
Gladstone's budget speech at length and p. 134 gives the following quotation
from this speech: 'This intoxicating augmentation' etc., that is, word
for word, exactly what I quoted. -- This proves irrefutably that the German
Manufacturers' Association 'lied in form' in decrying this 'sentence' as
a fabrication 'by me'!... The author of <i>The Theory of the Exchanges,"</i>
Marx then continued, "quoted, like myself, not from Hansard, but from a
London newspaper which, on April 17, published the April 16 budget speech."</p>
<p class="fst">
And in fact the author of this hook, which incidentally is a vulgar diatribe,
quoted from Hansard just as little as did Marx. But Marx, as we shall soon
show, also did not even quote from a London newspaper. First, however,
it must be noted here that when we stated that Marx had lyingly added the
sentence in question to Gladstone's speech, we did not claim, either "in
form or In content", that he himself had also fabricated it. This would
only be the case if Marx himself had been the fabricator of that still
very obscure book, though one might be tempted to believe this on account
of the ghastly style in which it is written. The source from which Marx
quotes this sentence is actually this book itself, and this is also the
reason why, as he claims in his "collectanea of cuttings for 1863", he
has "searched in vain for the relevant extract and thus, also, for the
name of the newspaper that published it"! This origin of Marx's quotation
is shown clearly by a comparison of the passage in <i>Capital</i>, his
book in which Marx reviews Gladstone's budget speech, and <i>The Theory
of the Exchanges</i> There, on p. 639, particularly in Note 103,a this
speech is quoted in the absolutely senseless version given verbatim by
that book on p. 134. And the glosses too, which Marx bases on the contradiction
contained in this version, are already contained in that book, in particular
also the quotation from Molière given in Note 105 on p. 640 of <i>Capital</i>;
and in the same way the statement of the LONDON ORPHAN ASYLUM about the
rising prices of foodstuffs quoted by Marx appears on p. 135 of that book,
though Marx bases his claim for its correctness not on that book, but on
that book's sources (see <i>Capital</i>, p. 640, Note 104).</p>
<p>Now we ask; does anyone tell a lie only when he himself invents
an untruth, or does he not tell a lie quite as much when he repeats it
contrary to what he knows, or is hound to know better? We believe that
the answer is beyond doubt. And secondly, when Marx repeated the untruth
contained in <i>The Theory of the Exchanges</i>, did he not do this contrary
to his better knowledge, or should he at least not have known better? The
answer here is also simple. The first rule for any interpretation, a rule
undoubtedly known to Mr. Marx, is to interpret passages which at first
glance contain contradictions -- and thus make no sense -- in such a way
that the contradiction disappears; and if the available text appears to
make this impossible, one should make a textual criticism rather than believe
in the presence of a contradiction. And this was all the more imperative
in the case of a speech which aroused the interest and admiration of the
entire educated world, notably through its mastery of the material and
its clarity. And finally it was an act of frivolity bordering upon the
criminal to act in any other way than scrupulously when intending to tear
Out of context a passage which provides one half of the contradiction in
this version and to cast it as a denunciation of the propertied amongst
the propertyless all over the world. Karl Marx should have taken umbrage
at this version if only on the basis of general learning, science and conscientiousness;
and the criminal frivolity with which he accepts this lying quotation is
completely inexcusable in his case, since the full text of Gladstone's
speech was available to him. On the one hand, the English newspapers reproduced
this speech the day after it was delivered, and, if Dot true to the word,
then true to the sense. And then, immediately after the delivery of the
speech, Gladstone published it verbatim in his book <i>Financial Statements</i>,
London, 1863, which attracted great attention; and on p.403 of that book
the speech is printed just as we quoted it. Finally, Marx could refer to
the shorthand report of this speech in <i>Hansard's Parliamentary Debates</i>,
and it is the custom to always quote a speech to Parliament from the shorthand
report, even if it contains no contradictions to the necessarily bungling
newspaper reports.</p>
<p>But here we come, to be sure, to Marx's third line of defence,
and this far exceeds, in its impudent mendacity, anything which came before.
Marx actually does not shrink from citing <i>The Times</i> of April 17,
1863 as proof of the correctness of his quotation. <i>The Times</i> of
April 17, 1863, p.7, col. 5, line 17ff, reports, however, the speech as
follows:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"That is the state of the case as regards the wealth of this country.
<b>I must say for one, I should look almost with apprehension </b>and <b>with
pain upon this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power, if it were
my belief that </b>it was <b>confined to classes finding themselves in
pleasant circumstances.</b> This takes no cognizance at all of the condition
of the labouring population. The augmentation I have described, <i>and
the figures of which are based, I think, upon accurate returns</i>, * is
entirely confined to classes of property." (Marx quotes <i>The Times</i>
to this point; we quote further.) "Now, the augmentation of Capital is
of indirect benefit to the labourer, because it cheapens the commodity
which in the business of production comes into direct competition with
labour. (<i>Hear, hear!)</i> But we have this profound, and, I must say,
inestimable consolation, that, while the rich have been growing richer,
the poor have been growing less poor. -- Whether the extremes of poverty
are less extreme than they were I do not presume to say, <i>but the average
condition of the British labourer, we have the happiness to know, has improved
during the last 20 years in a degree which we know to be extraordinary,
and which we may almost pronounce to be unexampled in the history of any
country and of any age. (Cheers)"</i></p>
<p class="fst">
* (<i>Note by Brentano</i>: In his German quotation in the <i>Volksstaat</i>
Marx omits this relative clause and instead inserts: "which he" (Gladstone)
"had just described as 'this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power'."
This omission and this insertion too are designed to mislead the reader
about the sense of Gladstone's words. The omitted relative clause and in
addition the general context show that the sense of the speech is as follows:
The augmentation of wealth shown by the income tax returns is certainly
confined to the classes of property (since this tax is only imposed upon
persons with an income of 150 pounds sterling and over), but with regard
to the labouring class, we know, etc.)</p>
<p>A comparison of this <i>Times</i> report with the report after
Hansard in the <i>Concordia</i> of March 7 will show that both reports
fully coincide materially. The report in <i>The Times</i> just gives, formally
more contracted, what the shorthand report by Hansard gives verbatim. Yet
despite the fact that the <i>Times</i> report contains the direct opposite
of that notorious passage in the Inaugural Address, and the fact that according
to the <i>Times</i> report, too, Mr. Gladstone said he believed this intoxicating
augmentation of wealth and power <i>not</i> to be confined to classes in
easy circumstances, Marx has the impudence to write in the <i>Volksstaat</i>
of June 1:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"So, on April 16, 1863, Mr. Gladstone declared 'both in form and in
content' that 'this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power is entirely
confined to the classes possessed of property'."</p>
<p class="fst">
But even more. Since we had already presented to the public the complete
text of the speech from Hansard, and this text completely excluded the
possibility of any distortion, an attempt is made to delete this very embarrassing
circumstance with the phrase in the Hansard "edition, here botchily corrected,
Mr. Gladstone was bright enough clumsily to excise the passage that would
be, after all, compromising on the lips of an English Chancellor of the
Exchequer"! All that is lacking is the claim that Gladstone probably did
this in deference to the diatribe <i>The Theory of the Exchanges</i>, which
did not appear until 1864!</p>
<p>What can one say about such methods? First we are presented, on
the basis of an obscure diatribe, with a quotation which was completely
forged, and the contradictory substance of which proved that it was forged,
even without confronting it with the original. Called to account in this
matter, Marx states that others quoted in the same way as he did, and refers
to people whom he himself fooled with this lie. Even more: from the fact
that his fuzzy sources accord with him, he tries to fashion an argument
to excuse himself and show the correctness of his quotation, as though
both of them had drawn upon a joint, correct, third source, though in fact
one had only copied from the other. And finally he has the impudence to
base himself on newspaper reports which directly contradict him. Indeed,
to describe these practices we know only one word, a word with which Marx
himself is very familiar (see <i>Capital</i>, p. 257): they are simply
"nefarious".</p>
<p>Marx closes his defence with these words: "The irksome subsequent
events will perhaps teach the Manufacturing Associates that, however well
they may know how to forge goods, they are as well fitted to judge literary
goods as a donkey is to play the lute."</p>
<p>We confidently leave it to the reader to decide on which side
the forgery and the irksomeness ultimately lie. In a further article we
shall explain to Mr. Marx the importance which we attach to the content
of Gladstone's words.</p>

MARX'S SECOND REPLY</h3>
<h4><i>DER VOLKSSTAAT</i>, No. 55, AUGUST 7, 1872</h4>
<p class="fst">
In the <i>Concordia</i> of July 4, the German Manufacturers' Association
attempted to prove to me that its "learned men" were as well fitted to
judge literary goods as the Association was to forge commercial ones.</p>
<p>With reference to the passage from Gladstone's budget speech of
April 16, 1863, as quoted in the Inaugural Address of the International,
the manufacturers' organ (No. 10) stated:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><b>"Marx has added the sentence lyingly, both in form and in content."</b></p>
<p class="fst">
It thus declares that I fabricated the sentence in both form and content,
with hair and bones. Even more: it knows exactly how I did so. The paper
writes: "The fact that Gladstone mentioned this, etc., <i>was utilised
by Marx in order to hove Gladstone say</i>, etc." By quoting the sentence
from a work published <i>before</i> the Inaugural Address, <i>The Theory
of the Exchanges</i>, I exposed the crude lie of the manufacturers' organ.
As the paper itself relates, it then ordered from London this work which
it did not know, and convinced itself of the facts of the matter. How could
it lie itself out of the situation? See here:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"When we stated that Marx had lyingly added the sentence in question
to Gladstone's speech, we did not claim, either in form or in content,
<i>that he himself had also fabricated it."</i></p>
<p class="fst">
Here we obviously have a case of equivocation peculiar to the mind of manufacturers.
For example, when a manufacturing swindler, in agreement with business
colleagues, sends out into the world rolls of ribbon that contain, instead
of the alleged three dozen ells only two dozen, then he has in fact <i>lyingly
added</i> one dozen ells, precisely because he <i>"has not fabricated"</i>
them. Why, moreover, should lyingly added sentences not behave just like
lyingly added ells? "The understandings of the greater part of men," says
Adam Smith, "are necessarily formed by their ordinary employments", the
understandings of the manufacturer included.</p>
<p>Through the <i>Volksstaat</i>, I extended the erudite materials
of the manufacturers' organ, not only with the quotation from <i>The Theory
of the Exchanges</i>, but also with the pages from my work <i>Capital</i>
concerning Gladstone's budget speeches. Now, from the material with which
I provided it, the paper attempts to prove that I did not quote the disputed
passage from a "London newspaper", but from <i>The Theory of the Exchanges.</i>
The chain of arguments is another sample of manufacturers' logic.</p>
<p>I told the manufacturers' sheet that <i>The Theory of the Exchanges</i>
quotes on page 134 exactly as I quoted, and it discovers -- that I quoted
exactly as <i>The Theory of the Exchanges</i> quotes on page 134.</p>
<p>And further!</p>
<p class="quoteb">"And the glosses too, which Marx bases on the contradiction contained
in this version, are already contained in that book."</p>
<p class="fst">
This is simply a lie. On page 639 of <i>Capital</i>, I give my glosses
to the words in Gladstone's speech:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"While the rich have been growing richer, the poor have been growing
less poor. Whether the extremes of poverty are less, I do not presume to
say."</p>
<p class="fst">
My remark on this is: "How lame an anti-climax! If the working class has
remained 'poor', only 'less poor' in proportion as it produces for the
wealthy class 'an intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power', then
it has remained relatively just as poor. If the extremes of poverty have
not lessened, they have increased, because the extremes of wealth have."
And these "glosses" are nowhere to be found in <i>The Theory of the Exchanges.</i></p>
<p class="quoteb">"And the glosses too ... are already contained in that hook, <i>in
particular also</i> the quotation from Molière given in Note 105
on p. 640 of <i>Capital."</i></p>
<p class="fst">
So, "in particular also" I quote Molière, and leave it up to the
"learned men" of the <i>Concordia</i> to detect and communicate to the
public the fact that the quotation comes from <i>The 'Theory of the Exchanges.</i>
In fact, however, I state expressly in Note 105, p. 640 of <i>Capital</i>
that the author of <i>The Theory of the Exchanges "characterises with the
following quotation from Molière"</i> the "continual crying contradictions
in Gladstone's budget speeches".</p>
<p>Finally:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"... in the same way the statement of the LONDON ORPHAN ASYLUM about
the rising prices of foodstuffs quoted by Marx appears on p. 135 of that
book, though Marx bases his claim for its correctness not on that hook,
but on that book's sources (see <i>Capital</i>, p. 640, Note 104)".</p>
<p class="fst">
The <i>Concordia</i> advisedly forgets to inform its readers that "that
book" gives <i>no sources.</i> What was it trying to prove? That I took
from that "book" a passage from Gladstone's speech without knowing its
source. And how does the <i>Concordia</i> prove it? By the fact that I
really did take a quotation from that book, and checked it with the original
sources, independent of the book!</p>
<p>Referring to my quotation from Professor Beesly's article in <i>The
Fortnightly Review</i> (November 1870), the <i>Concordia</i> remarks.</p>
<p class="quoteb">"This article by Professor Beesly deals, in fact, with the history
of the International, and as the author himself informs every enquirer,
was written on the basis of material provided him by <i>Marx</i> himself."</p>
<p class="fst">
Professor Beesly states:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"To no one is the success of the association so much due as to Dr.
Karl Marx, who, in his acquaintance with the history and statistics of
the industrial movement in all parts of Europe, is, I should imagine, without
a rival. I am LARGELY indebted to him for the information contained in
this article."</p>
<p class="fst">
All the material with which I supplied Professor Beesly referred exclusively
to the history of the International, and not a word concerned the Inaugural
Address, which he had known since its publication. The context in which
his above remark stood left so little doubt on this point that <i>The Saturday
Review</i>, in a review of his article, more than hinted that <i>he himself</i>
was the author of the Inaugural Address. [<i>Brentano note</i>: Professor
Beesly drew my attention, in writing, to this <i>quid pro quo.</i>]</p>
<p>The <i>Concordia</i> asserts that Professor Beesly did not quote
the passage in question from Gladstone's speech, but only stated <i>"that
the Inaugural Address contained this quotation".</i> Let us look into this.</p>
<p>Professor Beesly states:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"The address [...] is probably the most striking and powerful statement
of the workman's case as against the middle class that has ever been compressed
into a dozen small pages. I wish I had space for copious extracts from
it."</p>
<p class="fst">
After mentioning the "frightful statistics of the Blue Books", to which
the Address refers, he goes on:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"From these appalling Statistics the address passes on to the income-tax
returns, from which it appeared that the taxable income of the country
had increased in eight years twenty per cent, 'an intoxicating augmentation
of wealth and power', <i>as Mr. Gladstone observed</i>, 'entirely confined
to classes of property'."</p>
<p class="fst">
Professor Beesly sets the words: <i>"as Mr. Gladstone observed"</i> outside
quotation marks, Saying these words on his own behalf, and thus proves
to the <i>Concordia</i> with the greatest clarity that he knows Gladstone's
budget speech -- solely from the quotation in the Inaugural Address! As
the London business friend of the German Manufacturers' Association, he
is the only man who knows Gladstone's budget speeches, just as he, and
he alone, knows: "Persons with an income under 150 pounds sterling, in
fact, pay no income tax in England." (See the <i>Concordia</i>, Nos. 10
and 27.) Yet English tax officials suffer from the idée <i>fixe</i>
that this tax only stops at incomes under 100 pounds sterling.</p>
<p>Referring to the disputed passage in the Inaugural Address, the
manufacturers' paper stated:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>"Yet this sentence is nowhere to be found in Gladstone's speech."</i>
I proved the contrary with a quotation from the <i>"Times" report</i> of
April 17, 1863. I gave the quotation in the <i>Volksstaat</i> in both English
and German, since a commentary was necessary on account of Gladstone's
assertion that he would "look almost with apprehension and with pain upon
<i>this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power</i>, if it were"
his "belief that it was confined to the <i>CLASSES WHO ARE IN EASY CIRCUMSTANCES".</i>
Basing myself on Wakefield, I declared that the <i>"CLASSES WHO ARE IN
EASY CIRCUMSTANCES"</i> -- an expression for which there is no German equivalent
-- means the "really rich", "the really prosperous portion" of the propertied
classes. Wakefield actually calls the real middle class <i>"THE UNEASY
CLASS</i> which is in German roughly "die ungemächliche Klasse". [<i>Marx
note</i>: "THE MIDDLE OR UNEASY CLASS" [E. G. Wakefield] ("ENGLAND AND
AMERICA", London, 1833, V.1, p.185).]</p>
<p class="fst">
The manufacturers' worthy organ not only suppresses my exposition, it ends
the passage I quoted with the words: "Marx quotes <i>The Times</i> to this
point", thus leaving the reader to suppose that it had quoted from my translation;
in fact, however, the paper, leaving my version aside, does not translate
"CLASSES WHO ARE IN EASY CIRCUMSTANCES" as "wohlhabenden Klassen" but as
"Klassen, die sich in <i>angenehmen Verhältnissen befinden".</i> The
paper believes its readers capable of understanding that not all sections
of the propertied class are "prosperous", though it will always be a "pleasant
circumstance" for them to possess property. Even in the translation of
my quotation, as given by the <i>Concordia</i>, however, Gladstone describes
the progress of Capitalist wealth as <i>"this intoxicating augmentation
of wealth and power"</i>, and remarks that here he has <i>"taken no cognizance
at all</i> of the condition of the labouring population", closing with
words to the effect that this <i>"augmentation is entirely confined to
the classes possessed of property".</i> Once the "learned man" of the German
Manufacturers' Association has, in the report of <i>The Times</i> of April
17, 1863, thus had Gladstone say "both in form and in content", the same
as I had him say in the Inaugural Address, he strikes his swollen breast,
brimming with conviction, and blusters:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"<i>Yet despite this Marx has the impudence</i> to write in the <i>Volksstaat</i>
of June 1: 'So, on April 16, 1863, Mr. Gladstone declared <i>'both in form
and in content'</i> in the House of Commons, as reported in his own organ,
<i>The Times</i>, on April 17, 1863 that <i>'this intoxicating augmentation
of wealth and power is entirely confined to the classes possessed of property'."</i></p>
<p class="fst">
The "learned man" of the German Manufacturers' Association obviously knows
exactly what to offer his readership!</p>
<p>In the <i>Volksstaat</i> of June 1, I remarked that the <i>Concordia</i>
was trying to make its readers believe I had suppressed in the Inaugural
Address Gladstone's phrases about the improvement in the condition of the
British working class, though in fact the exact opposite was the case,
and I stressed there with great emphasis the glaring contradiction between
this declamation and the officially established facts. In its reply of
July 4, the manufacturers' paper repeated the same manoeuvre. "Marx quotes
The Times to this point," the paper says, "we quote further." In confrontation
with the paper, I needed only to quote the disputed passage, but let us
look for a moment at the "further".</p>
<p>After pouring forth his panegyric on the increase of Capitalist
wealth, Gladstone turns to the working class. He takes good care not to
say that it had shared in the "intoxicating augmentation of wealth and
power". On the contrary, he goes on, according to The Times: "Now, the
augmentation of Capital is of indirect benefit to the labourer, etc." He
consoles himself further on with the fact "that while the rich have been
growing richer, the poor have been growing less poor". Finally, he asserts
that he and his enriched parliamentary friends "have the happiness to know"
the opposite of what parliamentary enquiries and statistical data prove
to be the fact, viz.,</p>
<p class="quoteb">"that the average condition of the British labourer has improved during
the last 20 years in a degree which we know to be extraordinary, and which
we may almost pronounce to be unparalleled in the history of any country
and of any age".</p>
<p class="fst">
Before Mr. Gladstone, all his predecessors "had the happiness" to supplement
the picture of the augmentation of Capitalist wealth in their budget speeches
with self-satisfied phrases about the improvement in the condition of the
working class. Yet he gives the lie to them all; for the millennium dates
only from the passing of the Free Trade legislation. The correctness or
incorrectness of Gladstone's reasons for consolidation and congratulation
is, however, a matter of indifference here. We are concerned solely with
this: that, from his standpoint, the pretended "extraordinary" improvement
in the condition of the working class in no way contradicts the "intoxicating
augmentation of wealth and power that is entirely confined to the classes
possessed of property". On the contrary. It is the orthodox doctrine of
the mouthpieces of Capital -- Mr. Gladstone being one of the best paid
-- that the most infallible means for working men to benefit themselves
is -- to enrich their exploiters.</p>
<p>The shameless stupidity or stupid shamelessness of the manufacturers'
organ culminates in its assurance: "The report in The <i>Times</i> just
gives, formally more contracted, what the shorthand report by Hansard gives
<i>verbatim."</i> [<i>Marx note</i>: The manufacturers' paper appears actually
to believe that the big London newspapers employ no shorthand writers for
their parliamentary reports.] Now let us see both reports:</p>

I leave it to the reader himself to compare the stilted, involved, complicated
CIRCUMLOCUTION OFFICE [From Ch. Dickens' <i>Little Dorrit -- MECW Ed.</i>]
style of the Hansard publication with the report in <i>The Times.</i></p>
<p>Here it is enough to establish that the words of the <i>Times</i>
report: "This intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power ... the augmentation
I <i>have described ... is an augmentation entirely confined to the classes
possessed of property"</i>, are in part garbled by Hansard and in part
completely suppressed. Their emphatic "exact wording" escaped no earwitness.
For example:</p>
<p class="fst"><i>"The Morning Star", April 17, 1863 (Gladstone's budget speech
of April 16, 1863).</i></p>
<p class="quoteb">"I must say, for one, I should look with apprehension and with pain
upon <i>this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power</i>, if it were
my belief that it was confined to the CLASSES WHO ARE IN EASY CIRCUMSTANCES.
<i>THIS GREAT INCREASE OF WEALTH</i> takes no cognizance at all of the
condition of the labouring population. <i>THE AUGMENTATION IS AN AUGMENTATION
ENTIRELY CONFINED</i> TO <i>THE CLASSES POSSESSED OF PROPERTY.</i> BUT
<i>THAT AUGMENTATION</i> must be of indirect benefit to the labouring population,
etc."</p>
<p class="fst">
<i>"The Morning Advertiser", April 17, 1863 (Gladstone's budget speech
of April 16, 1863).</i></p>
<p class="quoteb">"I must say, for one, I should look almost with apprehension and ALARM
upon <i>this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power</i>, <b>if </b>it
were my belief that it was confined to the CLASSES WHO ARE IN EASY CIRCUMSTANCES.
<i>This great increase of wealth</i> takes no cognizance at all of the
condition of the labouring population. <i>THE AUGMENTATION STATED is an
augmentation entirely confined to the CLASSES POSSESSED OF PROPERTY. THIS
AUGMENTATION</i> must be of indirect benefit to the labouring population,
etc."</p>
<p class="fst">
Thus, Gladstone subsequently filched away from the semiofficial Hansard
report of his speech the words that he had uttered in the House of Commons
on April 16, 1863: <i>"This intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power
... is an augmentation entirely confined to the classes possessed of property."</i>
The <i>Concordia</i> did not, therefore, find this in the excerpt provided
by their business friend in London, and trumpeted:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"Yet this sentence is nowhere to be found in Gladstone's speech. <b>Marx
has added the sentence lyingly, both in form and in content."</b></p>
<p class="fst">
It is no surprise that they now weepingly tell me that it is the critical
<i>"custom"</i> to quote parliamentary speeches as officially falsified,
and not as they were actually delivered. Such a "custom" in fact accords
with the "general" Berlin "education", and the limited thinking of the
German Manufacturers' Association which is typical of Prussian subjects.
Lack of time forces me to end, once and for all, my pleasurable exchange
of opinions with the Association, but as a farewell, another nut for its
"learned men" to crack. In what article did a man -- and what was his name
-- utter to an opponent of a rank at least equal with that of the <i>Concordia</i>,
the weighty words: <i>"Asinus manebis in secula seculorum"?</i> ["Thou
wilt remain an ass for evermore."]</p>

THE REJOINDER OF ANONYMOUS</h3>
<h4><i>CONCORDIA</i>, No. 54, AUGUST 22, 1872<br>
<i>More on the Character of Karl Marx</i></h4>
<p class="fst">
On August 7, in the <i>Volksstaat</i>, Karl Marx replied to the article
"How Karl Marx Defends Himself" in No. 27 of the <i>Concordia.</i> Astonishing
is the dogged mendacity with which he clings to the distorted quotation
from Gladstone's budget speech of April 16, 1863, astonishing even for
someone for whom no means are too base for his subversive plans. In fact
this can only be explained by the fear, which must be called forth in the
author, of the very embarrassing effect of confessing that this quotation,
the bombshell of the Inaugural Address, is false, given the great circulation
of the latter.</p>
<p>It will be recalled that in his first defence Marx admitted the
shorthand report of Gladstone's speech in Hansard did not contain this
quotation. But the reason was: Mr. Gladstone had clumsily excised this
compromising passage! Initial proof: Professor Beesly, in an article in
<i>The Fortnightly Review</i> had quoted this speech in the same way as
the Inaugural Address.</p>
<p>This could lead the reader to believe that Professor Beesly had
quoted Gladstone's speech in an essay on some other historical theme than
the International. We therefore remarked, firstly, that this article dealt
with the history of the International, and was written on the basis of
material that Marx himself had provided the author with. And Marx does
not now deny this. However, he assures us that the material he provided
did not contain a single word referring to the contents of the Inaugural
Address, which had been known to Professor Beesly since its publication.
However, we never said or insinuated such a thing. And we absolutely believe
Mr. Marx's assurance. Had he shown Mr. Beesly <i>The Theory of the Exchanges</i>
as the source of his quotation, Beesly would certainly have refrained from
reprinting it. Secondly, we replied -- and this is the main rejoinder:
it was not Beesly who quoted the passage in question from Gladstone's speech;
he only cited it in an analysis of the Inaugural Address. We quoted word
for word the relevant sentence from Beesly's article, as can be seen in
No. 27 of the <i>Concordia.</i> The fact that Beesly, in his analysis,
gave the words "as Mr. Gladstone observed" without quotation marks * is
now used by Marx to explain to his readers that Beesly, suddenly interrupting
his analysis, said these words on his own behalf!! [<i>Note by Brentano</i>:
Additional note on republication: Professor Beesly copied the passage which
he quoted from the Inaugural Address exactly as given there. There, however,
the inserted clause is naturally without quotation marks.]</p>
<p>Marx sought to find further proof that Gladstone had clumsily
excised the words in question from his speech in the fact that <i>The Theory
of the Exchanges</i>, a publication which appeared before the Inaugural
Address, quoted Gladstone's budget speech word for word as in the Address.
We checked with the book, saw that this was correct, but that everything
suggests Marx himself took his quotation from this book. The main sign
of this was that <i>Capital</i> by Marx, on p.639, especially in Note 103,
quotes this speech in the <i>absolutely senseless</i> version given verbatim
by <i>The Theory of the Exchanges</i> on p.134. This suggestion that <i>The
Theory of the Exchanges</i> was the source of Marx's quotation is further
supported by the fact that in the passage in his book <i>Capital</i> where
he quotes the Gladstone speech just as <i>The Theory of the Exchanges</i>
did on p. 134, he gives other quotations to be found at the same place
in that book, and adds glosses like this. How does Mr. Marx reply to this?
For a start, that he also added glosses which are not to be found in <i>The
Theory of the Exchanges.</i> But neither is this precluded by our remark.
Then he states that he specifically named the author of <i>The Theory of
the Exchanges</i> as the author of the quotation from Molière. But
we did not claim the contrary. Finally, regarding the statement of the
LONDON ORPHAN ASYLUM, which Marx quotes on p. 640 of his book just as <i>The
Theory of the Exchanges</i> does on p. 135, Marx himself admits that he
quoted verbatim from this book, but that he checked the correctness with
the original sources. Marx thus testifies himself that part of the glosses
which he appends to the quotation from Gladstone's speech come from <i>The
Theory of the Exchanges.</i> He thus bears witness to the correctness of
the points with which we supported our main argument that he had also taken
from <i>The Theory of the Exchanges</i> the quotation from Gladstone's
speech. But he has nothing to say in answer to this main argument, in answer
to the remark that he, like <i>The Theory of the Exchanges</i>, quotes
Gladstone's speech in the <i>same absolutely senseless version.</i></p>
<p>Thirdly and finally, Marx attempts to prove his claim that Gladstone
subsequently falsified his own budget speech in the shorthand report in
Hansard by referring to the report of this speech in <i>The Times</i> of
April 17, 1863. But this report shows the exact opposite, since <i>The
Times</i> and Hansard fully coincide materially. To obscure recognition
of this fact by his readers, Marx utilises various methods. <i>The first
method</i>, designed simultaneously to awaken amongst the readers of the
<i>Volksstaat</i> <b>new </b>admiration for the erudition of their oracle,
was a philological lecture. Gladstone explicitly stated, also according
to the <i>Times</i> report, insofar as Marx quoted this, that he believed
that the intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power of which he had
spoken was <i>not</i> confined "TO THE CLASSES WHO ARE IN EASY CIRCUMSTANCES",
i.e. the classes finding themselves in pleasant circumstances. Basing himself
upon Wakefield, who had written a book entitled <i>The Middle or Uneasy
Class</i>, Marx now claimed that Gladstone had said he believed this augmentation
was Dot confined to the "really rich", the "really prosperous portion"
of the propertied classes; and since we took no notice of this entire argumentation,
he now accuses us of suppression. But if we remained silent about this
further attempt at falsification, the only reason was that it was, in fact,
too manifest. For whatever Wakefield may have meant when he called the
middle class THE UNEASY CLASS the whole context of Gladstone's speech,
in the <i>Times</i> report too, shows that by the "CLASSES WHO ARE IN EASY
CIRCUMSTANCES" Gladstone at this point <i>meant those classes which are
not part of the working population, since he drew a contrast between them
and it.</i></p>
<p>Marx's <i>second method</i> of obscuring the <i>Times</i> report
was simply to suppress, in his German translation of this report, the relative
clause which showed that Gladstone had only said that the augmentation
of wealth, which was shown by the income tax returns, was confined to the
classes of property, since the working classes were not subject to income
tax, and that thus nothing about the increase in the prosperity of the
working classes could be learned from the income tax returns; not, however,
that the working classes in reality had been excluded from the extraordinary
augmentation of national wealth. Marx, who, as we just have seen, quite
unwarrantably accused the <i>Concordia</i> of suppression, once again quietly
suppressed this relative clause, although we had remonstrated with him
about his distortion. And even more. We had stated, in accordance with
the truth, that the report in <i>The Times</i> just gives, formally more
contracted, what the shorthand report by Hansard gives verbatim; but he
denies this and dares to print side by side the <i>Times</i> report and
that from Hansard, <i>though he</i> naturally <i>once again omits this
relative clause.</i> But what does it matter? The readers of the <i>Volksstaat</i>,
with whom he is concerned, cannot check up on him!</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i> and finally, Marx attempted to conceal the agreement
between the <i>Times</i> report and the Hansard report by failing to quote
those sentences in which, according to <i>The Times</i> too, Gladstone
directly and explicitly testified to the elevation of the British working
class. We made a remark about this, and quoted in full the relevant passage
of the <i>Times</i> report. Despite this, Marx lies to his readers that
we had wanted to give the impression that we were quoting <i>The Times</i>
according to his translation! But against this, he naturally suppresses
our proof (in No. 28) that the glaring contradiction, according to Marx,
between Gladstone's claim about the improvement in the condition of the
British working class and the officially established facts, does not exist
in reality; instead he repeats once again this accusation.</p>
<p>Apart from this, Marx, in his reply in the <i>Volksstaat</i> of
August 7, produces two further witnesses to the correctness of his reading
of Gladstone's budget speech: <i>The Morning Star</i> and <i>The Morning
Advertiser</i> of April 17, 1863. But we do not need to check whether Marx
has quoted the two papers without fresh falsification. [<i>Note by Brentano</i>:
Additional note on republication: Here too Marx omits the same sentences
which he suppressed in his reproduction of the <i>Times</i> report. See
the two reports at the beginning.] For these papers, even as he quotes
them, speak for us. After Gladstone had said, according to both papers,
that he did <i>not</i> believe <i>this</i> intoxicating augmentation of
wealth and power is confined to the classes which find themselves in pleasant
circumstances, he continued: <i>"This</i> great increase of wealth <i>takes
no cognizance at all</i> of the condition of the labouring population.
The augmentation <i>which I have described</i> is an augmentation entirely
confined to the classes possessed of property." The context and the use
of the expression <i>"take cognizance"</i> show clearly that <i>this</i>
increase and the augmentation of the increase cited, and the citing, are
intended to indicate those discernible in the income tax returns.</p>
<p>But the introduction of these new alleged witnesses is only an
expression of the faked thoroughness, intended to perpetuate the faith
of <i>Volksstaat</i> readers in their oracle. Marx's article in the <i>Volksstaat</i>
of August 7 is a model of this, and worthy of perusal by our readers in
person. We need only quote one more example of this, in order to deprive
Mr. Marx of the argument that we wished to conceal from our readers that
he had corrected us on a point of minor import. We had stated that in England
persons with an income under 150 pounds sterling paid no income tax. Mr.
Marx taunts us that we do not know this tax only ceases on incomes under
100 pounds sterling. In fact the law of 1842 left all incomes under 150
pounds sterling quite free of tax, but in 1853 the tax was extended downwards
to 100 pounds sterling, although the newly included incomes were treated
more lightly, since they were subjected to a lower rate of tax than those
of 150 pounds sterling and above. In 1863 the favored sector was extended
to 200 pounds sterling exclusive upwards, and the tax reduction granted
in the manner that for every income from that figure down to 100 pounds
sterling inclusive, 60 pounds sterling could be subtracted as tax-free.</p>
<p>Mr. Marx closes his article by telling us that lack of time forces
him to end, once and for all, his pleasurable exchange of opinions with
us. We understand that Mr. Marx welcomes the opportunity of avoiding somebody
who uncovers his forgeries. When Mr. Marx finally ends his article by breaking
into abuse, we can assure him that his opponents could desire nothing more
than the confession of guilt which lies herein. Abuse is the weapon of
those whose other means of defence have run out.</p>

ATTACK BY S. TAYLOR</h3>
<h4><i>THE TIMES</i>, NOVEMBER 29, 1885<br>
<i>To the Editor of "The Times"</i></h4>
<p class="fst">
Sir, -- I ask leave to point out in <i>The Times</i> that the Origin of
the misleading quotation from Mr. Gladstone's Budget speech of April 16,
1863, which so eminent a publicist as Professor Émile de Laveleye
a has been led to reproduce through reliance on German sources, and with
respect to which he inserts a correction in <i>The Times</i> of this day,
is to be found as far back as 1864 in an address issued by the council
of the famous International Working Men's Association.</p>
<p>What appears extremely singular is that it was reserved for Professor
Brentano (then of the University of Breslau, now of that of Strassburg)
to expose, eight years later in a German newspaper, the bad faith which
had manifestly dictated the citation made from Mr. Gladstone's speech in
the address.</p>
<p>Herr Karl Marx, who as the acknowledged author of the address
attempted to defend the citation, had the hardihood, in the deadly shifts
to which Brentano's masterly conduct of the attack speedily reduced him,
to assert Mr. Gladstone had "manipulated" (<i>zurechtgestümpert)</i>
the report of his speech in <i>The Times</i> of April 17, 1863, before
it appeared in "Hansard", in order "to obliterate" (<i>wegzupfuschen)</i>
a passage which "was certainly compromising for an English Chancellor of
the Exchequer". On Brentano's showing, by a detailed comparison of texts,
that the reports of <i>The Times</i> and of "Hansard" agreed in utterly
excluding the meaning which craftily-isolated quotation had put upon Mr.
Gladstone's words, Marx withdrew from further' controversy under the plea
of "want of time"!</p>
<p>The whole of the Brentano-Marx correspondence is eminently worthy
of being unearthed from the files of newspapers under which it lies buried,
and republished in an English form, as it throws upon the latter disputant's
standard of literary honesty a light which can be ill spared at a time
when his principal work is presented to us as nothing less than a fresh
gospel of social renovation.</p>

ELEANOR MARX'S REPLY</h3>
<h4><i>TO-DAY</i>, FEBRUARY 1884</h4>
<p class="fst">
<i>To the Editor of "The Times"</i></p>
<p>Sir, -- In <i>The Times</i> of November 29th Mr. Sedley Taylor
refers to a certain quotation of a speech by Mr. Gladstone,</p>
<p class="quoteb">"to be found as far back as 1864, in an address issued by the council
of the famous International Working Men's Association".</p>
<p class="fst">
He continues: (I here quote Mr. Taylor's letter from "What appears" to
"want of time").</p>
<p>The facts are briefly these. The quotation referred to consists
of a few sentences from Mr. Gladstone's Budget speech of April 16th, 1863.
After describing the immense increase of wealth that took place in this
country between 1853 and 1861 Mr. Gladstone is made to say:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"This intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power is entirely confined
to classes of property."</p>
<p class="fst">
An anonymous writer, who turns out to be Professor Brentano, published
in a German paper, <i>Concordia</i>, of the 7th March, 1872 a reply in
which it was stated:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"This sentence does not exist in Mr. Gladstone's speech, Marx has added
it lyingly, both as to form and contents" (<i>formel und materiel hinzugelogen).</i></p>
<p class="fst">
This was the only point at issue between my father and his anonymous opponent.</p>
<p>In his replies in the Leipzig <i>Volksstaat</i>, June 1st and
August 7th, 1872, Dr. Marx quotes the reports of Mr. Gladstone's speech
as follows:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>"The Times</i>, April 17th:</p>
<p class="quoteb" style="margin-left: 100px;">"The augmentation I have described, and which is founded, I think, on accurate returns, is an augmentation entirely confined to classes of
property.</p>
<p class="quoteb">
<i>Morning Star</i> 17th April:</p>
<p class="quoteb" style="margin-left: 100px;">"This augmentation is an augmentation confined entirely to the classes possessed of property,</p>
<p class="quoteb">
<i>Morning Advertiser</i>, April 17th:</p>
<p class="quoteb" style="margin-left: 100px;">"The augmentation stated is altogether limited to classes possessed of property.</p>
<p class="fst">
The anonymous Brentano, in the "deadly shifts to which his own masterly
conduct of the attack had reduced him", now took refuge under the assertion
usual in such circumstances, that if the quotation was not a forgery it
was, at all events, "misleading", in "bad faith", "craftily isolated",
and so forth. I am afraid you would not allow me space to reply to this
accusation of Herr Brentano, repeated now, after eleven years, by Mr. Taylor.
Perhaps it will not be required, as Mr. Taylor says:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"The whole of this Brentano-Marx correspondence is eminently worthy
of being unearthed from the file of newspapers in which it lies buried
and republished in an English form."</p>
<p class="fst">
I quite agree with this. The memory of my father could only gain by it.
As to the discrepancies between the newspaper reports of the speech in
question and the report in "Hansard" I must leave this to be settled by
those most interested in it.</p>
<p>Out of thousands and thousands of quotations to be found in my
father's writings this is the only one the correctness of which has ever
been disputed. The fact that this single and not very lucky instance is
brought up again and again by the professorial economists is very characteristic.
In the words of Mr. Taylor,</p>
<p class="quoteb">"it throws upon the latter disputant's" (Dr. Marx) "standard of literary
honesty a light which can ill be spared at a time when his principal work
is presented to us as nothing less than a fresh gospel of social renovation".</p>

SEDLEY TAYLOR'S RETORT</h3>
<h4><i>TO-DAY</i>, MARCH 1884<br>
<i>To the Editors of "To-Day"</i></h4>
<p>Gentlemen,</p>
<p>No one can regret more than I do that Miss Marx should have been
refused the public hearing to which she was so manifestly entitled. I am,
however, far from thinking with her that the question whether a particular
sentence did, or did not, occur in Mr. Gladstone's speech "was the only
point at issue between" Dr. Marx and Professor Brentano. I regard that
question as having been of very subordinate importance compared to the
issue whether the quotation in dispute was made with the intention of conveying,
or of perverting, Mr. Gladstone's meaning.</p>
<p>It would obviously be impossible to discuss in this letter the
contents of the voluminous Brentano-Marx controversy without making an
inadmissible demand on your space. As, however, Miss Marx has in your columns
characterised as a "calumny" and "libel" an opinion publicly expressed
by me, [<i>Note by Engels</i>: In the covering letter to the Editors of
<i>To-Day</i>, not published here.] I feel bound to ask your insertion,
side by side, of the two following extracts, which will enable your readers
to judge for themselves whether Dr. Marx has quoted fairly or unfairly
from the Budget Speech of 1863 in his great work, "Das Kapital". My reason
for using the <i>Times</i> report in preference to that of Hansard will
be obvious to readers of Dr. Marx' letters in his correspondence with Brentano.

<p class="fst">
I invite especial attention to the hearing on Mr. Gladstone's meaning of
the passages in the <i>Times</i> report which I have thrown into italics.
The sentence, <i>"I must say ... easy circumstances,"</i> conveys the speaker's
belief that the intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power previously
described was <i>not</i> confined to those in easy circumstances. There
is, it is true, a verbal contrariety with the later sentence, "The augmentation
... property," but the intervening words, <i>"This takes no cognisance...
population,"</i> unmistakably show what Mr. Gladstone meant, viz., that
the figures which he had given, being based on the income-tax returns,
included only incomes above the exemption limit, [<i>Note by Taylor</i>:
This stood at £150 from 1842 to 1853, and was then lowered to £100.]
and therefore afforded no indication to what extent the total earnings
of the labouring population had increased during the period under consideration.
The closing passage, from <i>"but the average"</i> to the end, announces
in the most emphatic language that, on evidence independent of that obtained
from the income-tax returns, Mr. Gladstone recognised as indubitable an
extraordinary and almost unexampled improvement in the average condition
of the British labourer.</p>
<p>Now, with what object were these essential passages almost wholly
struck out in the process by which the newspaper report was reduced to
the remarkable form in which it appears in Dr. Marx' work? Clearly, I think,
in order that the arbitrarily-constructed mosaic, pieced together out of
such of Mr. Gladstone's words as were allowed to remain, might be understood
as asserting that the earnings of the labouring population had made but
insignificant progress, while the incomes of the possessing classes had
increased enormously -- a view which the omitted passages explicitly repudiate
in favour of a very different opinion.</p>
<p>I must not pass over unnoticed the fact that the German translation
of this docked citation in the text of "Das Kapital" is immediately followed
there by the expression of Dr. Marx' contemptuous astonishment at the "lame
anti-climax" presented by the sentence made to figure as the conclusion
of Mr. Gladstone's paragraph, when compared with his previous description
of the growth of wealth among the possessing classes.</p>

ELEANOR MARX'S SECOND REPLY</h3>
<h4><i>TO-DAY</i>, MARCH 1884<br>
<i>To the Editors of "To-Day"</i></h4>
<p>Gentlemen,</p>
<p>Mr. Sedley Taylor disputes my statement that, when the anonymous
slanderer fell foul of Dr. Marx, the only point at issue was whether Mr.
Gladstone had used certain words or not. According to him, the real question
was,</p>
<p class="quoteb">"whether the quotation in dispute was made with the intention of conveying
or of perverting Mr. Gladstone's meaning".</p>
<p class="fst">
I have before me the <i>Concordia</i> article (No. 10, 7th March, 1872),
"How Karl Marx Quotes". Here the anonymous author first quotes the "Inaugural
Address" of the International; then the passage of Mr. Gladstone's speech,
in full, from Hansard; then he condenses the passage in his own way, and
to his own satisfaction; and lastly, he concludes,</p>
<p class="quoteb">"Marx takes advantage of this to make Gladstone say, 'This intoxicating
augmentation of wealth and power is entirely confined to classes possessed
of property. <i>This sentence, however, is nowhere to be found in Gladstone's
speech. The very contrary is said in it. Marx has lyingly added this sentence,
both as to form and contents."</i></p>
<p class="fst">
That is the charge, and the only charge, made against Dr. Marx. He is indeed
accused of perverting Mr. Gladstone's meaning by "lyingly adding" a whole
sentence. Not a word about "misleading", or "craftily isolated" quotations.
The question simply is, "whether a particular sentence did, or did not,
occur in Mr. Gladstone's speech".</p>
<p>Of two things, one. Either Mr. Taylor has read Brentano's attacks
and my father's replies, and then his assertion is in direct contradiction
of what he cannot help knowing to be the truth. Or else he has not. And
then? Here is a man who dates his letters from Trinity College, Cambridge,
who goes out of his way to assail my dead father's literary honesty in
a way which must needs turn out to be a "calumny" unless he proves his
case; who makes this charge upon the strength of a literary controversy
dating as far back as 1872, between an anonymous writer (whom Mr. Taylor
now asserts to be Professor Brentano) and my father; who describes in glowing
terms the "masterly conduct" in which Saint George Brentano led his attack,
and the "deadly shifts" to which he speedily reduced the dragon Marx; who
can give us all particulars of the crushing results obtained by the said
St. George "by a detailed comparison of texts"; and who after all, puts
me into this delicate position that I am in charity bound to assume that
he has never read a line of what he is speaking about.</p>
<p>Had Mr. Taylor seen the "masterly" articles of his anonymous friend,
he would have found therein the following:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"Now we ask; does anyone tell a lie only then when he himself invents
an untruth, or does he not tell a lie quite as much when. he repeats it
contrary to what <b>he knows, </b><i>or is bound to know better?"</i></p>
<p class="fst">
Thus saith the "masterly" Brentano, as virtuous as he is anonymous, in
his rejoinder to my father's first reply (<i>Concordia</i>, No. 27, 4th
July, 1872, p. 210). And on the same page he still maintains against all
comers:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"According to the <i>Times</i> report, too, Mr. Gladstone said he believed
this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power <i>not</i> to be confined
to classes of property."</p>
<p class="fst">
If Brentano thus appears utterly ignorant of what was the real point at
issue, is Mr. Sedley Taylor better off? In his letter to <i>The Times</i>
it was a quotation made in the "Inaugural Address" of the International.
In his letter to <i>To-Day</i> it is a quotation in "Das Kapital". The
ground is shifted again, but I need not object. Mr. Taylor now gives us
the Gladstonian passage as quoted on pages 678 and 679 of "Das Kapital",
side by side with the same passage as reported -- not by Hansard, but by
<i>The Times.</i></p>
<p class="quoteb">"My reason for using the <i>Times</i> report instead of that of Hansard,
will be obvious to readers of Dr. Marx's letters and his correspondence
with Brentano."</p>
<p class="fst">
Mr. Taylor, as we have seen, is not of these "readers". His reason for
his proceeding may therefore be obvious to others, but upon his own showing
at least, it can hardly be so to himself.</p>
<p>Anyhow, from Hansard the Infallible we are brought down to that
very report, for using which the anonymous Brentano (<i>Concordia</i>,
same page, 210), assails my father as quoting "necessarily bungling (<i>stümperhafte)</i>
newspaper reports". At any rate, Mr. Taylor's "reason" must be very "obvious"
to his friend Brentano.</p>
<p>To me that reason is obvious indeed. The words which my father
was accused of having lyingly added ("an augmentation", etc.), these words
are contained in <i>The Times</i> as well as in the other dailies' reports,
while in Hansard they are not only "manipulated", but entirely "obliterated".
Marx established this fact. Mr. Taylor, in his letter to <i>The Times</i>,
still awfully shocked at such unpardonable "hardihood", is now himself
compelled to drop the impeachable Hansard, and to take refuge under what
Brentano calls the "necessarily bungling" report of <i>The Times.</i></p>
<p>Now for the quotation itself. Mr. Taylor invites especial attention
to two passages thrown by him into italics. In the first he owns:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"<i>there is, it is true, a verbal contrariety</i> with the latter
sentence'. the augmentation property; but the intervening words: this takes
... population, unmistakeably show what Mr. Gladstone meant," etc., etc.</p>
<p class="fst">
Here we are plainly on theological ground. It is the well-known style of
orthodox interpretation of the Bible. The passage, it is true, is in itself
contradictory, but if interpreted according to the true faith of a believer,
you will find that it will bear out a meaning not in contradiction with
that true faith. If Mr. Taylor interprets Mr. Gladstone as Mr. Gladstone
interprets the Bible, he must not expect any but the orthodox to follow
him.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Gladstone on that particular occasion, either did speak
English or he did not. If he did not, no manner of quotation or interpretation
will avail. If he did, he said that he should be very sorry if that intoxicating
augmentation of wealth and power was confined to classes in easy circumstances,
but that it was confined entirely to classes of property. And that is what
Marx quoted.</p>
<p>The second passage is one of those stock phrases which are repeated,
with slight variations, in every British budget speech, seasons of bad
trade alone excepted. What Marx thought of it, and of the whole speech
is shown in the following extract from his second reply to his anonymous
slanderer;</p>
<p class="quoteb">"Gladstone, having poured forth his panegyric on the increase of Capitalist
wealth, turns towards the working class. He takes good care not to say
that they had shared in the intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power.
On the contrary, he continues (according to <i>The Times):</i> 'Now, the
augmentation of Capital is of indirect benefit to the labourers,' etc.
He <i>consoles</i> himself with the fact that while the rich have been
growing richer, the poor have been growing less poor. He asserts, finally,
he and his enriched parliamentary friends 'have the happiness to know'
the contrary of what official enquiries and statistical dates prove to
be the fact, viz.,</p>
<p class="quoteb" style="margin-left: 100px;">"'that the average condition of the British labourer has improved during

<i>"Before</i> Mr. Gladstone, all his predecessors 'had the happiness'
to complete in their budget speeches the picture of the augmentation of
Capitalist wealth by self-complacent phrases about the improvement in the
condition of the working class. Yet he gives the lie to them all; for the
millennium dates only from the passing of the Free Trade legislation. But
the correctness or incorrectness of Gladstone's reasons for consolation
and congratulation is a matter of indifference here. What alone concerns
us is this, that from his stand-point the pretended 'extraordinary' improvement
in the condition of the working-class is not at all in contradiction with
the augmentation of wealth and power which is entirely confined to classes
possessed of property. It is the orthodox doctrine of the mouth-pieces
of Capital -- one of the best paid of whom is Gladstone -- that the most
infallible means for working men to benefit themselves is -- to enrich
their exploiters." (<i>Volksstaat</i>, No. 63, August 7, 1872).</p>
<p class="fst">
Moreover, to please Mr. Taylor, the said passage of Mr. Gladstone's speech
<i>is quoted in full</i> in the Inaugural Address, page 5, immediately
before the quotation in dispute. And what else but this address did Mr.
Taylor originally impute? Is it as impossible to get a reference to original
sources out of him, as it was to get reasons out of Dogberry?</p>
<p>"The continuous crying contradictions in Gladstone's budget speeches"
form the subject of Note 105 on the same page (679) of "Das Kapital" to
which Mr. Taylor refers us. Very likely indeed, that Marx should have taken
the trouble to suppress "in bad faith" one of the contradictions! Quite
the contrary. He has not suppressed anything worth quoting, neither has
he "lyingly" added anything. But he has restored, rescued from oblivion,
a particular sentence of one of Mr. Gladstone's speeches, a sentence which
had indubitably been pronounced, but which somehow or other had found its
way -- out of Hansard.</p>

<h3>IV. ENGELS AND BRENTANO</h3>
<a id="d12"></a>
<h3>No. 12.<br>
FROM ENGELS' PREFACE TO THE FOURTH GERMAN EDITION OF MARX'S</h3>
<h4><i>Capital</i>, VOLUME ONE</h4>
<p class="fst">
Meanwhile a complete revision of the numerous quotations had been made
necessary by the publication of the English edition. For this edition Marx's
youngest daughter, Eleanor, undertook to compare all the quotations with
their originals, so that those taken from English sources, which constitute
the vast majority, are given there not as retranslations from German but
in the original English form. In preparing the fourth edition it was therefore
incumbent upon me to consult this text. The comparison revealed various
small inaccuracies. Page numbers wrongly indicated, due partly to mistakes
in copying from notebooks, and partly to the accumulated misprints of three
editions; misplaced quotation or omission marks, which cannot be avoided
when a mass of quotations is copied from notebook extracts; here and there
some rather unhappy translation of a word; particular passages quoted from
the old Paris notebooks of 1843-45, when Marx did not know English and
was reading English economists in French translations, so that the double
translation yielded a slightly different shade of meaning, e.g., in the
case of Steuart, Ure, etc., where the English text had now to be used --
and other similar instances of trifling inaccuracy or negligence. But anyone
who compares the fourth edition with the previous ones can convince himself
that all this laborious process of emendation has not produced the smallest
change in the book worth speaking of. There was only one quotation which
could not be traced -- the one from Richard Jones (4th edition, p. S62,
Note 47). Marx probably slipped up when writing down the title of the book.
All the other quotations retain their cogency in full, or have enhanced
it due to their present exact form.</p>
<p>Here, however, I am obliged to revert to an old story.</p>
<p>I know of only one case in which the accuracy of a quotation given
by Marx has been called in question. But as the issue dragged beyond his
lifetime I cannot well ignore it here.</p>
<p>On March 7, 1872, there appeared in the Berlin <i>Concordia</i>,
organ of the German Manufacturers' Association, an anonymous article entitled:
"How Karl Marx Quotes." It was here asserted, with an effervescence of
moral indignation and unparliamentary language, that the quotation from
Gladstone's budget speech of April 16, 1863 (in the Inaugural Address of
the International Working Men's Association. 1864, and repeated in <i>Capital</i>,
Vol. I, p.617, 4th edition; p. 671, 3rd edition),c had been falsified;
that not a single word of the sentence: "this intoxicating augmentation
of wealth and power ... is entirely confined to classes of property" was
to be found in the (semi-official) shorthand report in Hansard. "Yet this
sentence is nowhere to be found in Gladstone's speech. It says quite the
opposite." (In bold type): <b><i>"Marx has added the sentence lyingly,
both in form and in content!"</i></b></p>
<p>Marx, to whom the number of <i>Concordia</i> was sent the following
May, answered Anonymous in the <i>Volksstaat</i> of June 15. As he could
not recall which newspaper report he had used for the quotation, he limited
himself to citing, first the equivalent quotation from two English publications,
and then the report in <i>The Times</i>, according to which Gladstone says:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"That is the state of the case as regards the wealth of this country.
I must say for one, I should look almost with apprehension and with pain
upon this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power, if it were my
belief that it was confined to classes who are in easy circumstances. This
takes no cognizance at all of the condition of the labouring population.
The augmentation I have described and which is founded, I think, upon accurate
returns, is an augmentation entirely confined to classes of property."</p>
<p class="fst">
Thus Gladstone says here that he would be sorry if it were so, but <i>it
is</i> so: this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power <i>is</i>
entirely confined to classes of property. And as to the semi-official Hansard,
Marx goes on to say: "In its edition, here botchily corrected, Mr. Gladstone
was bright enough clumsily to excise the passage that would be, after all,
compromising on the lips of an English Chancellor of the Exchequer. This
is, incidentally, traditional English parliamentary practice, and by no
means the invention of little Lasker versus Bebel."</p>
<p>Anonymous gets angrier and angrier. In his answer in the <i>Concordia</i>,
July 4, he sweeps aside second-hand sources and demurely suggests that
it is the "custom" to quote parliamentary speeches from the shorthand report;
adding, however, that the <i>Times</i> report (which includes the "lyingly
added" sentence) and the Hansard report (which omits it) "fully coincide
materially", while the <i>Times</i> report likewise contains "the direct
opposite of that notorious passage in the Inaugural Address". This fellow
carefully conceals the fact that the <i>Times</i> report explicitly includes
that self-same "notorious passage , alongside of its alleged "opposite".
Despite all this, however, Anonymous feels that he is stuck fast and that
only some new dodge can save him. Thus, whilst his article bristles, as
we have just shown, with "impudent mendacity" and is interlarded with such
edifying terms of abuse as "bad faith", "dishonesty", "lying statement",
"that lying quotation", "impudent mendacity", "a quotation completely forged",
"this forgery", "simply nefarious", etc., he finds it necessary to divert
the issue to another domain and therefore promises "to explain in a second
article the importance which we" (the non-"mendacious" Anonymous) "attach
to the content of Gladstone's words". As if his particular opinion, of
no decisive value as it is, had anything whatever to do with the matter.
This second article was printed in the <i>Concordia</i> on July 11.</p>
<p>Marx replied again in the <i>Volksstaat</i> of August 7 now giving
also the reports of the passage in question from <i>The Morning Star</i>
and <i>The Morning Advertiser</i> of April 17, 1863. According to both
reports Gladstone said that he would look with apprehension, etc., upon
this intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power if he believed it to
be <i>confined</i> to CLASSES IN EASY CIRCUMSTANCES. But this augmentation
<i>was</i> in fact ENTIRELY CONFINED TO CLASSES POSSESSED OF PROPERTY.
So these reports too reproduced word for word the sentence alleged to have
been "lyingly added". Marx further established once more, by a comparison
of the <i>Times</i> and the Hansard texts, that this sentence, which three
newspaper reports of identical content, appearing independently of one
another the next morning, proved to have been really uttered, was missing
from the Hansard report, revised according to the familiar "custom", and
that Gladstone, to use Marx's words, "had subsequently filched it away".
In conclusion Marx stated that he had no time for further intercourse with
Anonymous. The latter also seems to have had enough, at any rate Marx received
no further issues of <i>Concordia.</i></p>
<p>With this the matter appeared to be dead and buried. True, once
or twice later on there reached us, from persons in touch with the University
of Cambridge, mysterious rumours of an unspeakable literary crime which
Marx was supposed to have committed in <i>Capital</i>; but despite all
investigation nothing more definite could be learned. Then, on November
29, 1883, eight months after Marx's death, there appeared in <i>The Times</i>
a letter dated from Trinity College, Cambridge, and signed Sedley Taylor,
in which this little man, who dabbles in the mildest sort of co-operative
affairs, seizing upon some chance pretext or other, at last enlightened
us, not only concerning those vague Cambridge rumours, but also Anonymous
in the <i>Concordia.</i></p>
<p class="quoteb">"What appears extremely singular," says the little man from Trinity
College, "is that it was reserved for <i>Professor Brentano</i> (then of
the University of Breslau, now of that of Strassburg) to expose ... the
bad faith which had manifestly dictated the citation made from Mr. Gladstone's
speech in the '(Inaugural)' Address. Herr Karl Marx, who ... attempted
to defend the citation, had the hardihood, in the DEADLY SHIFTS to which
Brentano's masterly conduct of the attack speedily reduced him, to assert
that Mr. Gladstone had 'manipulated' the report of his speech in <i>The
Times</i> of April 17, 1863, before it appeared in Hansard, in order to
'obliterate' a passage which 'was certainly compromising for an English
Chancellor of the Exchequer'. On Brentano's showing, by a detailed comparison
of texts, that the reports of <i>The Times</i> and of Hansard agreed in
utterly excluding the meaning which craftily-isolated quotation had put
upon Mr. Gladstone's words, Marx withdrew from further controversy under
the plea of 'want of time!'"</p>
<p class="fst">
So that was at the bottom of the whole business! And thus was the anonymous
campaign of Mr. Brentano in the <i>Concordia</i> gloriously reflected in
the productively co-operating imagination of Cambridge. Thus he stood,
sword in hand, and thus he battled, in his "masterly conduct of the attack",
this St. George of the German Manufacturers' Association, whilst the infernal
dragon Marx, "in deadly shifts", "speedily" breathed his last at his feet.</p>
<p>All this Ariostian battle-scene, however, only serves to conceal
the dodges of our St. George. Here there is no longer talk of "lying addition"
or "forgery", but of "CRAFTILY ISOLATED QUOTATION". The whole issue was
shifted, and St. George and his Cambridge squire very well knew why.</p>
<p>Eleanor Marx replied in the monthly journal <i>To-Day</i> (February
1884) a, as <i>The Times</i> refused to publish her letter. She once more
focused the debate on the sole question at issue: had Marx "lyingly added"
that sentence or not? To this Mr. Sedley Taylor answered that</p>
<p class="quoteb">"the question whether a particular sentence did or did not occur In
Mr. Gladstone's speech" had been, in his opinion, "of very subordinate
importance" in the Brentano-Marx controversy, "compared to the issue whether
the quotation in dispute was made with the intention of conveying, or of
perverting, Mr. Gladstone's meaning".</p>
<p class="fst">
He then admits that the <i>Times</i> report contains "a verbal contrariety";
but, if the context is rightly interpreted, i.e., in the Gladstonian Liberal
sense, it shows what Mr. Gladstone <i>meant</i> to say. (<i>To-Day</i>,
March 1884) The most comic point here is that our little Cambridge man
now insists upon quoting the speech <i>not</i> from Hansard, as, according
to the anonymous Brentano, it is "customary" to do, but from the <i>Times</i>
report, which the same Brentano had characterised as "necessarily bungling".
Naturally so, for in Hansard the vexatious sentence <i>is missing.</i></p>
<p>Eleanor Marx had no difficulty (in the same issue of <i>To-Day)</i>
in dissolving all this argumentation into thin air. Either Mr. Taylor had
read the controversy of 1872 in which case he was now making not only "lying
additions" but also "lying suppressions"; or he had not read it and ought
to remain silent. In either case it was certain that he did not dare to
maintain for a moment the accusation of his friend Brentano that Marx had
made a "lying" addition. On the contrary, Marx, it now seems, had not lyingly
added hut suppressed an important sentence. But this same sentence is quoted
on page 5 of the Inaugural Address, a few lines before the alleged "lying
addition". And as to the "contrariety" in Gladstone's speech, is it not
Marx himself, who in <i>Capital</i>, p. 618 (3rd edition, p. 672), Note
105 a refers to "the continuous crying contradictions in Gladstone's budget
speeches of 1863 and 1864"? Only he does not presume à la Mr. Sedley
Taylor to resolve them into complacent Liberal sentiments. Eleanor Marx,
in concluding her reply, finally sums up as follows:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"Marx has not suppressed anything worth quoting, neither has he 'lyingly'
added anything. But he has restored, rescued from oblivion, a particular
sentence of one of Mr. Gladstone's speeches, a sentence which had indubitably
been pronounced, but which somehow or other had found its way -- out of
Hansard."</p>
<p class="fst">
With that Mr. Sedley Taylor too had had enough, and the result of this
whole professorial cobweb, spun out over two decades and two great countries,
is that nobody has since dared to cast any other aspersion upon Marx's
literary honesty; whilst Mr. Sedley Taylor, no doubt, will hereafter put
as little confidence in the literary war bulletins of Mr. Brentano as Mr.
Brentano will in the papal infallibility of Hansard.</p>

BRENTANO'S REPLY</h3>
<h4><i>"My Polemic with Karl Marx", Berlin, 1890, pp. 3-5</i></h4>
<p class="fst">
On September 28, 1864, a public meeting was held in St. Martin's Hall,
Long Acre, London, at which Englishmen, Germans, Frenchmen, Poles and Italians
were represented. Karl Marx submitted to this meeting the Provisional Rules
of an international workers' organisation which was to be founded, together
with the Inaugural Address he had drafted for the same. Both were adopted
unanimously, and the Inaugural Address went round the world. It contained
a quotation from Gladstone's budget speech of April 16, 1863, which attracted
more attention than all the other statements contained therein:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"Dazzled by the 'Progress of the Nation' statistics dancing before
his eyes, the Chancellor of the Exchequer exclaims in wild ecstasy: 'From
1842 to 1852 the taxable income of the country increased by 6 per cent;
in the eight years from 1853 to 1861, it has increased from the basis taken
in 1853, 20 per cent! The fact is so astonishing as to be almost incredible!...
This intoxicating augmentation of wealth and power,' adds Mr. Gladstone,
'is entirely confined to classes of property.'"</p>
<p class="fst">
In the winter of 1871-72, while working on the second volume of my <i>Die
Arbeitergilden der Gegenwart</i>, I was obliged to investigate (cf. II,
241) to what extent the oft-heard objection -- that a wage increase diminishes
the future demand for labour -- accords with the facts. In the previous
decades this objection had repeatedly been used against the English trade
associations every time they called for wage increases. Here I recalled
this quotation from Gladstone's budget speech. However, it appeared to
me to be unwise to quote as a source the Address of the International,
as many others had, and the relevant passage in Marx's <i>Capital</i>,
Vol 1,1867, p.639. I consulted the shorthand report of Gladstone's budget
speech and found that this in fact showed that the wage increases in the
period 1842-1861 had not limited the increase in the income of the possessing
classes in any way which negatively affected their demand for labour; but
that, on the contrary Gladstone had stated in direct opposition to Karl
Marx's claim: "The figures which I have quoted take little or no cognizance
of the condition of those who do not pay income tax ... of the property
of the lahouring population, or of the increase of its income... But if
we look to the average condition of the British labourer, whether peasant,
or miner, or operative, or artisan, we know from varied and indubitable
evidence that during the last twenty years such an addition has been made
to his means of subsistence as we may almost pronounce to be without examp]e
in the history of any country and of any age.</p>
<p>In view of the great importance of the Gladstone's quotation for
the Social Democratic claim that in the framework of the existing state
and social order the rich would necessarily become ever richer and the
poor ever poorer, I drew the attention of the editors of the <i>Concordia</i>,
<i>Zeitschrift für die Arbeiterfrage</i>, at that time appearing in
Berlin, to the forgery which had been committed here. They asked me to
write an article on the subject, which was published in the <i>Concordia</i>
of March 7, 1872. The article was not signed by me; this was done, on the
one hand, at the request of the editors in the interests of the reputation
of their paper, and, on the other hand, I had all the less objection, since
following earlier literary controversies pursued by Marx it was to be expected
that this time too he would heap personal insults upon his adversary, and
that for this reason it could only be amusing to leave him in the dark
as to the identity of his adversary.</p>
<p>Three months later Marx replied in the <i>Volksstaat</i>. In the
polemic which then developed it became clear that Marx had not undertaken
the forgery himself, but had taken the forged quotation from a diatribe
which had been published anonymously in 1864. This work, entitled <i>The
Theory of the Exchanges. The Bank Charter Act of 1844. The abuse of the
metallic principle to depreciation. Parliament mirrored in Debate, supplemental
to 'The Stock Exchange and the Repeal of Sir J. Barnard's Act'</i>, London:
T. Cautley Newby, 80, Welbeck Street, 1864, is the work of a perverse Thersites
and consists largely of garbled quotations from writings and speeches on
national economy, bestrewn with Latin, English and French verses and other
comments, aimed at derision. Being of such a nature, this book has understandably
remained in thorough obscurity.</p>
<p>Had Marx simply admitted that he had been misled by this book,
and from then on reproduced the quotation correctly, one might have been
surprised that he had relied upon such a source, hut the mistake would
at least have been rectified. But for him there was no question of this.
And given the wide circulation which had been attained by the Inaugural
Address, the loss of this show-piece as the result of this correction,
would have been very embarrassing for the agitation. One of the main agitational
methods of Social Democracy is that its representatives proclaim themselves
the sole proprietors of real science; and as the Party Congress in Halle
148 showed, they prefer to accuse themselves of having utilised the iron
law of wages in deliberate untruthfulness simply as a means of agitation,
rather than confess that they have been shown to be in error. Instead of
withdr;iwing, Marx therefore attempted to prove that Gladstone had subsequently
tinkered with the shorthand report of his budget speech; the loutishnesses
of his Scurrilous polemics was now directed against the supposed manufacturer,
who had attempted to tell him what to do with the help of an English business
partner; when it was shown that The Times too, in its issue which appeared
on the morning following the night in which Gladstone had made his speech,
carried this speech in a sense according with the shorthand report, he
acted, as the editors of the <i>Concordia</i> wrote: "like the cuttlefish,
which dims the water with a dark fluid, in order to make pursuit by its
enemy more difficult, i.e. he tries as hard as he can to hide the subject
of controversy by clinging to completely inconsequential secondary itatters;
and finally he saves himself with the explanation that for 'lack of time'
he cannot go into the matter any further." And for all time he failed to
reply to my analysis of his rejoinder published in the Concordia on August
22, 1872.</p>
<p>The fact that I was the author of the articles in the Concordia
of March 7, July 4 and 11, and August 22, 1872 was known to a ntimber of
people, and in the second edition of Mehring's <i>Geschichte der Sozialdemokratie</i>,
which was published while Marx was still alive, I was publicly named as
such. Having his attention thus drawn to it, Mr. Sedley Taylor of Trinity
College, Cambridge studied the polemic, and wrote a letter about it to
<i>The Times</i>. This brought upon the scene Miss Eleanor Marx, daughter
of Karl Marx, who had died in the meantime, and in the socialist monthly
<i>To-Day</i> of March 1884 she not only defended her father's loyalty,
but closed with the remark that her father had restored and rescued from
oblivion a particular sentence from one of Gladstone's speeches, a sentence
which had indubitably been pronounced, but which somehow or other had found
its way out of the shorthand report in Hansard.</p>
<p>Even at that time I considered replying to this obstinate clinging to
the false quotation with the verbatim publication of the entire polemic.
But editors often have their own judgement; the specialist journal which
I regarded as suitable above all others refused to publish, on the grounds
that the dispute lacked general interest. Engels was obviously of a different
opinion. In the Preface to the fourth edition of the first volume of <i>Capital</i>,
which he undertook, he returned to the polemic, hut reported upon it in
such a manner that the dishonesty with which it had been conducted by Marx
was, understandablv not made clear in addition he left unchanged the passage
in <i>Capital</i> I, 4th edition, p. 617, in which Marx had Gladstone say
the opposite of what he really said and Lven more while Marx in his first
edition simply referred to "Gladstone in H.o.C. April 16 1863", the 4th
edition added "<i>The Morning Star</i>, April 17 1863 as though the report
in this newspaper really contained the quotation as given by Marx. But
the report in <i>The Morning Star</i> too contains all those sentences
omitted by <i>The Theory of the Exchanges</i> and subsequently by Marx,
sentences which show that where Gladstone refers in his budget speech to
income tax revenue, he is onlv contrasting the incomes of those who pay
this tax with the incomes of those who, because of lower incomes, are free
of this tax; that he perceives from the income tax lists an intoxicating
augmentation of wealth and power, and remarks at the same time that the
increase in income shown by these lists is confined to those in easy circumstances
-- quite naturally, since the incomes of the rest are not shown in these
lists; but that he does <i>not</i> believe this augmentation is confined
to these classes, since it is known from other sources that at the same
time the condition of the British labourer has improved to a degree unexampled
in any country and any age...</p>

<p class="fst">
Noteworthy for the connection between <i>The Theory of the Exchanges</i>,
and Marx's remarks in <i>Capital</i>, I, 1st edition, p. 639 is also the
following. Having advanced here the details, quoted from <i>The Theory
of the Exchanges</i>, given by the LONDON ORPHAN ASYLUM, against Gladstone's
sentence "WHETHER THE EXTREMES OF POVERTY ARE LESS EXTREME THAN THEY WERE,
I DO NOT PRESUME TO SAY", Marx turns against Gladstone's budget speech
of April 7, 1864; <i>The Theory of the Exchanges</i> has an APPENDIX, in
which, as a supplement to the pages just printed here, there is also a
gloss on the budget of 1864. The style in which this is done is the same
as that which is familiar enough from the foregoing. This excursus contains
the following passage (p. 234):</p>
<p class="quoteb">"But the Chancellor is eloquent upon 'poverty'... 'Think of those who
are on the border of that region...', upon 'wages ... in others it is true
not increased... human life is, but, in nine cases out of ten, a struggle
for existence'."</p>
<p class="fst">
Now compare with this Marx, 1, 1st ed., p.640, 4th ed., p. 618. Here too
again, instead of the reproduction of the actual budget speech verbatim,
[we find the same mosaic of sentences torn from their context as in <i>The
Theory of the Exchanges.</i> And here too it is not this source which is
referred to, but simply to Gladstone, H.o.C., April 7, 1864. And then the
text continues: "The continual crying contradictions in Gladstone's budget
speeches of 1863 and 1864 were characterised by an English writer by the
following quotation from Molière" (followed by the verse from Molière
printed above).</p>
<p>It becomes clear that Marx took not only this quotation, but also
the "continual crying contradictions in Gladstone's budget speeches of
1863 and 1864", invented by the author of <i>The Theory of the Exchanges</i>,
from this book.</p>
<h3>* * *</h3>
<p>b) At was already remarked in the introduction to this reprint, Engels,
in the fourth edition of the first volume of Marx's <i>Capital</i>, p.
617, added <i>"The Morning Star</i>, April 17, 1863" to the now-as-ever
falsely reproduced quotation from Gladstone's budget speech. The relevant
portions of this speech are given above on pp. 8 and 9 according to Hansard's
shorthand report. Although on p.13 the <i>Times</i> report -- completely
coincident in sense, with its wording condensed only as is a newspaper's
wont, this report, together with that in <i>The Morning Star</i> quoted
by Engels, and the wording of the quotation in Marx are presented parallel

but in eight years, from 1853 to 1861, the income of the country again
increased from the basis taken by 20 per cent. That is a fact so strange
as to be almost incredible... <i>I must say for one, I should look almost

consolation, that while the rich have been growing richer the poor have

This great increase of wealth takes no cognizance at all of the condition

whether the extremes are less extreme than they were I do not presume to
say, <i>but the average condition of the British labourer, we have the
happiness to know to be extraordinary, and that we may almost pronounce
it to be unexampled in the history of any country or any age.</i> (Cheers)"</p></td>

<p>Here, in the middle of a sentence, as the reprint above shows,

<p>
The comparison above shows us that the arbitrarily thrown-together mosaic
of sentences torn from their context, which Marx presents as Gladstone's
budget speech, can be found as little in <i>The Morning Star</i> as in
<i>The Times</i> or Hansard; on the other hand, it can be found solely
in <i>The Theory of the Exchanges.</i> The heavily leaded sentences <i>a</i>
are those omitted by Henry Roy, and still more by Karl Marx-compare the
last sentence -- in order to have Gladstone say the opposite of what be
really said.</p>

<h3>No. 16.<br>
GLADSTONE TO BRENTANO</h3>
<h4><i>DEUTSCHES WOCHENBLATT</i>, No. 49, DECEMBER 4,1890</h4>
<p class="fst">
<i>Message</i></p>
<p>In number 45 of the <i>Deutsches Wochenblatt</i> Professor Lujo
Brentano published an essay My Polemic with Karl Marx", which served at
the same time as an introduction to a republication of this polemic as
a pamphlet. This polemic dealt mainly with a parliamentary speech delivered
by Gladstone in 1863, and which Marx reproduced in a distorted form in
his Inaugural Address on the formation of the International Working Men's
Association.</p>
<p>Obviously nobody is more qualified to settle this dispute about
the wording of Gladstone's speech than Gladstone himself. It is therefore
of special interest that Gladstone, as a result of the republication of
Brentano's polemic with Marx, has addressed two letters to Brentano. On
November 22 Gladstone wrote to Brentano: "You are completely correct, and
Marx completely incorrect", and on November 28: "I undertook no changes
of any sort". Thus the affair, which throws a revealing light on the Social
Democratic line of argumentation, may finally be decided to the detriment
of the Social Democratic standpoint.</p>
<p>By uncovering this deceit Brentano has done a service, and it
was very timely that he chose this precise moment to rekindle the memories
of this dispute.</p>

ENGELS' REPLY TO No. 16</h3>
<h4><i>DIE NEUE ZEIT</i>, No. 13, 1891, p.425</h4>
<h4><i>In the Case of Brentano V. Marx</i></h4>
<p class="fst">
In my preface to the fourth edition of Marx's <i>Capital</i>, Vol. I, I
was obliged to report upon the course of Mr. Lujo Brentano's favourite
anonymous campaign against Marx, a campaign based upon the charge that
Marx had forged a quotation from a speech by Gladstone.</p>
<p>Mr. Brentano responded to this with a pamphlet <i>My Polemic with
Karl Marx</i> by Lujo Brentano, Berlin, Walter und Apolant, 1890.1 shall
reply to this in his own coin.</p>
<p>In the meantime, No. 49 of the <i>Deutsches Wochenblatt</i>, December
4, 1890, carries a further note on this matter, which states:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"Obviously nobody is more qualified to settle this dispute about the
wording of Gladstone's speech than Gladstone himself. It is therefore of
special interest that Gladstone, as a result of the republication of Brentano's
polemic with Marx, has addressed two letters to Brentano. On November 22
Gladstone wrote to Brentano: 'You are completely correct, and Marx completely
incorrect', and on November 28: 'I undertook no changes of any sort'."</p>
<p class="fst">
What is this supposed to mean? <i>In what</i> "are you completely correct"
and Marx "completely incorrect"? <i>In what</i> "have I undertaken no changes
of any sort"? Why is Mr. Brentano's message confined to these two short
sentences?</p>
<p>Either Mr. Gladstone has not given his permission to publish the
whole of the letters. This is then proof enough that they prove nothing.</p>
<p>Or else Mr. Gladstone wrote the letters in the first place for
the public, and permitted Mr. Brentano to make what use he would of them.
Then the publication <i>only</i> of these meaningless extracts proves even
more strongly that Mr. Gladstone's testimony in its entirety is unusable
for Mr. Brentano, and therefore "bodged together" as above.</p>
<p>In order to know what the two sentences above are worth, we must
have before us not only the two letters from Mr. Gladstone, but also the
relevant letters from Mr. Brentano. And as long as the whole correspondence
in this matter has not been published in the original language, the fragments
above are completely insignificant to the question under dispute, and not
worth the paper they are printed on.</p>

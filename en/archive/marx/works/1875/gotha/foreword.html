The manuscript published here -- the covering letter to Bracke
as well as the critique of the draft programme -- was sent in
1875, shortly before the <a href="../../../../../glossary/events/g/o.html#gotha-congress" target=_blank>Gotha Unity Congress</a>, <a href="../../1875/letters/75-05-05.html" target=_blank>to Bracke</a> for communication to Geib, Auer, Bebel <span class="note"><a href="#1">[1]</a></span>, and Liebknecht and subsequent return to Marx. Since the <a href="../../../../../glossary/events/h/a.html#halle-party-congress" target=_blank>Halle Party Congress</a> has put the discussion of the Gotha Programme on the agenda of the Party, I think I would be guilty of suppression if I any longer withheld from publicity this important -- perhaps the most important -- document relevant to this discussion.</p>
<p>
But the manuscript has yet another and more far-reaching
significance. Here for the first time Marx's attitude to the
line adopted by Lassalle in his agitation from the very
beginning is clearly and firmly set forth, both as regards
Lassalle's economic principles and his tactics.</p>
<p>
The ruthless severity with which the draft programme is
dissected here, the mercilessness with which the results
obtained are enunciated and the shortcomings of the draft laid
bare -- all this today, after fifteen years, can no longer give
offence. Specific Lassalleans now exist only abroad as isolated
ruins, and in Halle the Gotha Programme was given up even by its
creators as altogether inadequate.</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, I have omitted a few sharp personal expressions
and judgments where these were immaterial, and replaced them by
dots. Marx himself would have done so if he had published the
manuscript today. The violence of the language in some passages
was provoked by two circumstances. In the first place, Marx and
I had been more intimately connected with the German movement
than with any other; we were, therefore, bound to be
particularly perturbed by the decidedly retrograde step
manifested by this draft programme. And secondly, we were at
that time, hardly two years after the <a href="../../../../../glossary/events/h/a.html#hague-congress" target=_blank>Hague Congress of the International</a>, engaged in the most violent struggle against Bakunin and his anarchists, who made us responsible for everything that happened in the labour movement in Germany; hence we had to expect that we would also be addled with the secret paternity of this programme. These considerations do not now exist and so there is no necessity for the passages in question.

</p>
<p>
For reasons arising form the Press Law, also, a few sentences
have been indicated only by dots. Where I have had to choose a
milder expression this has been enclosed in square
brackets. Otherwise the text has been reproduced word for word.</p>

Before the <i>Critique of the Gotha Programme</i> was written, Engels wrote a <a href="../../1875/letters/75-03-18.html" target=_blank>letter to August Bebel</a> expressing Marx and Engels' surprise at the programme, and going on to criticise it.</p>

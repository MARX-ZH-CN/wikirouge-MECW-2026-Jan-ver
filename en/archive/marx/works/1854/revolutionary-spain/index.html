<p class="information">
The series of articles Revolutionary Spain was written by Marx for the <i>New-York Daily Tribune</i> between August and November 1854. Marx observed all the symptoms of the revolutionary movement in Europe and paid much attention to the revolutionary events in the summer of 1854 in Spain. He held that the revolutionary struggle there could provide a stimulus for the development of the revolutionary movement in other European countries. In 1854, Marx made a thorough study of the events of the Spanish revolutions of the first half of the nineteenth century so as to improve his understanding of the specific character and features of the new Spanish revolution; Marx sent nine articles to the <i>New-York Daily Tribune</i> relating to the first (1808-14), second (1820-23) and partly third (1834-43) Spanish bourgeois revolutions, of which only the first six were published (the articles of September 29 and October 20 were printed in four issues of the newspaper) — thus eight articles in all. The remaining three were not published and the manuscripts have not been found. Only a small fragment from the draft manuscript has survived dealing with the causes that led to the defeat of the second revolution. It is probably part of the eighth article and is reproduced here as Chapter IX.</p>

The articles “Revolutionary Spain” were reproduced in English in 1939 by Lawrence &amp; Wishart Ltd. and International Publishers as <i>Revolution in Spain</i>.</p>

<h4>[London,] 2 September 1854, 28 Dean Street, Soho</h4>
<p>Dear Frederic,</p>
<p>So now you're a member of the Exchange, and <strong>altogether respectable. My gratulations</strong>. Some time I should like to hear you howling amidst that pack of wolves.</p>
<p>Heise has written to Imandt, telling him that factory people — where I don’t know (nor does he say whether they're workers or manufacturers) — have banded together to appoint him their <strong>common instructor</strong>, and that he can count on getting £2 a week. <i>Tant mieux pour lui</i> <span class="context">[so much the better for him]</span>.</p>
<p>My wife — as I had good reason to fear before she left —  <strong>is rather in too interesting circumstances</strong>, otherwise well.</p>
<p>Cluss has written again at last. I enclose his letter.</p>
<p>Has your old man arrived yet?</p>
<p>It is probably time we said something in the <i>Tribune</i> about military events in Asia. I have made a bit of a howler. In one of my recent <strong>letters</strong> I declared the <strong>news</strong> of the total defeat of the Turks at Kars to be a Vienna <strong>invention</strong>. True, the telegraphic dispatch was wrong, but it was nevertheless based on fact.</p>
<p><strong>My  principal study</strong> is now <strong>Spain</strong>. So far I have swotted up, mainly from Spanish sources, the 1808-14 and the 1820-23 periods. Am now coming to the years 1834-43. The thing is not without complexity. It is rather more difficult to discover exactly the springs behind developments. At any rate I made a timely start with <i>Don</i> <i>Quixote. </i>The whole thing will amount to about 6 articles for the <i>Tribune</i>, if much condensed. At least it may be counted a step forward that <strong>at this moment one’s studies </strong>are paid for.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Library is closed from 1-7 September. Apart from other advantages, it’s the only cool place in London.</p>
<p><i>Entre nous</i>, Dronke, for want of other ‘intellectual’ stimulus, is busily engaged in investigating ‘Steffen’ and, in his letters to Imandt, tears him to pieces in an attempt to render him politically ‘suspect’. I had no difficulty in convincing Imandt of the total absurdity of Dronke’s mischievous cavilling. <i>C'est absurde.</i> I consider that in Steffen our [party] has made a very good acquisition. He has character and education. His views on comparative geography, in which he has specialised, are quite original. Unfortunately a manuscript in which he elaborated his ideas on the subject was left behind in Cologne.</p>
<p>What is Lupus doing? Miquel didn’t come over from Paris as intended because, having had 2 attacks of cholera followed by a haemorrhage, he was finally ordered by the doctors to make his way back to Germany overland with all dispatch.</p>

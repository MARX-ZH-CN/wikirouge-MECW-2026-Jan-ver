<h4>February 29, 1888</h4>
<p>Have heard nothing of the Irish tricolour to which you refer. Irish flags in Ireland and here are simply green with a golden harp, but <i>without a crown </i>(in the British coat-of-arms the harp wears a crown). In the Fenian days, 1865-67, many were green and orange to show the Orangemen of the North <sup class="enote"><a href="#n356">[356]</a></sup> that they would not be destroyed, but accepted as brothers. However, no question of that any more.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="information"><span class="info"><a id="n356">356</a></span>. <i>Orange Lodges or Orangemen </i>(the Orangeist Order), named after William III, Prince of Orange — a terrorist organisation, set up by the landlords and Protestant clergy in Ireland in 1795 to fight against the national liberation movement of the Irish people. The Order united ultra-reactionary English and Irish elements from all layers of society and systematically incited Protestants against the Irish Catholics. The Orangemen had a particularly great influence in Northern Ireland, where the majority of the population were Protestants.</p>

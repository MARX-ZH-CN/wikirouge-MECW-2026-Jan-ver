<h3>Meeting of Standing Committee with Continental Delegates</h3>
<p class="fst">The question of a general congress was next discussed.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>Marx</i> in the name of the Central Council proposed that the
Congress assemble in Geneva.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>Dupleix</i> seconded the proposition.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>Fribourg</i> wished it recorded that the French delegates had
received instructions to propose Geneva instead of, as heretofore decided,
Belgium as a protest against the law passed in Belgium with regard to foreigners.
The resolution was carried unanimously.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>De Paepe</i> proposed, <i>Tolain</i> seconded, that the following
be submitted to the Conference this evening:</p>
<p class="fst">That the Conference transfer the place of meeting of the Congress
from Belgium to Geneva as a solemn protest against the law concerning foreigners
passed in Belgium. (Carried unanimously.)</p>
<p class="fst">The period for the assembling of the Congress was next discussed.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>Marx</i> and <i>Cremer</i> in the name of the Central Council
proposed that it take place in September or October of next year, unless
unforeseen circumstances shall occur to necessitate its further postponement.</p>
<p class="fst">The <i>delegates from Paris</i> as an amendment proposed that
the Congress assemble on the first Sunday in April next year. They all
declared that to longer postpone the Congress would be fatal to the Association
in France. [...]</p>
<p class="fst"><i>Marx</i> was impressed by the statements of the French delegates
and was inclined to withdraw the resolution. [...]</p>
<p class="fst">The French delegates would so far yield as to agree to the last
week in May.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>Marx</i> having withdrawn his proposition for September, the
amendment became the resolution and was unanimously agreed to. [...]</p>
<p class="fst"><i>Marx</i> and <i>Fribourg</i> proposed that the following questions
be submitted to the Congress: "Co-operative labour", "Reduction of the
number of the hours of labour", "Female and child labour".</p>
<p class="fst">All present voted for them as questions but Weston.</p>
<p class="fst"><i>Marx</i> and <i>Fribourg</i> proposed the following for the
Congress: "Direct and indirect taxation". Agreed to.</p>
<p class="fst">The following questions marked 3, 4 and 10 on the programme were
also agreed to:</p>
<p class="fst" style="margin-left: 100px;">
3. Combination of effort by means of the Association in the different
national struggles between Capital and Labour.</p>
<p class="fst" style="margin-left: 100px;">4. Trades' unions -- their past, present and future.</p>
<p class="fst" style="margin-left: 100px;">10. Standing armies: their effects upon the interests of the productive classes.</p>

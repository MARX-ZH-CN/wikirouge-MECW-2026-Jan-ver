Citizens,</p>
<p><span class="context">[The German text has "Working men"]</span></p>
<p class="fst">Since our last Congress at Basle, two great wars have changed
the face of Europe: the Franco-German War and the Civil War in France.
Both of these wars were preceded, accompanied, and followed by a third
war -- the war against the International Working Men's Association.</p>
<p>The Paris members of the International had told the French people
publicly and emphatically that voting the plebiscite was voting despotism
at home and war abroad Under the pretext of having participated in a plot
for the assassination of Louis Bonaparte they were arrested on the eve
of the plebiscite the 23rd of April 1870. <a href="#n1">[1]</a> Simultaneous
arrests of Internationalists took place at Lyons, Rouen Marseilles, Brest,
and other towns. In its declaration of May 3rd, 1870, the General Council
stated <a href="#n2">[2]</a>:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"This last plot will worthily range with its two predecessors of grotesque
memory. The noisy and violent measures against our French sections are
exclusively intended to serve one single purpose -- the manipulation of
the plebiscite."</p>
<p class="fst">
In point of fact, after the downfall of the December empire its governmental
successors published documentary evidence to the effect that this last
plot had been fabricated by the Bonapartist police itself, <a href="#n3">[3]</a>
and that on the eve of the plebiscite, Ollivier, in a private circular,
directly told his subordinates,</p>
<p class="quoteb">"The leaders of the International must be arrested or else the voting
of the plebiscite could not be satisfactorily proceeded with."</p>
<p class="fst">
The plebiscitary farce once over, the members of the Paris Federal Council
were indeed condemned, on the 8th of July, by Louis Bonaparte's own judges,
but for the simple crime of belonging to the International and not for
any participation in the sham plot. <a href="#n4">[4]</a> Thus the Bonapartist
government considered it necessary to initiate the most ruinous war that
was ever brought down upon France, by a preliminary campaign against the
French sections of the International Working Men's Association. Let us
not forget that the working class in France rose like one man to reject
the plebiscite Let us no more forget that</p>
<p class="quoteb">"the stock-exchanges, the cabinets, the ruling classes, and the press
of Europe celebrated the plebiscite as a signal victory of the French emperor
over the French working class." -- (Address of General Council on the Franco-Prussian
War. 23rd July, 1870.)</p>
<p class="fst">
A few weeks after the plebiscite, when the imperialist press commenced
to fan the warlike passions amongst the French people, the Paris Internationalists,
nothing daunted by the government persecutions, issued their appeal of
the 12th of July, "to the workmen of all nations", denounced the intended
war as a "criminal absurdity", telling their "brothers of Germany", that</p>
<p class="quoteb">their "division would only result in the complete triumph of despotism
on both sides of the Rhine", and declaring that "we, the members of the
International Association, know of no frontiers."</p>
<p class="fst">
Their appeal met with an enthusiastic echo from Germany, so that the General
Council was entitled to state,</p>
<p class="quoteb">"The very fact that while official France and Germany are rushing into
a fratricidal feud, the workmen of France and Germany send each other messages
of peace and good will -- this great fact, unparalleled in the history
of the past-opens the vista of a brighter future. It proves that in contrast
to old society with its economical miseries and its political delirium,
a new society is springing up whose international rule will be <i>peace</i>,
because its national ruler will be everywhere the same --<i> Labour.</i>
The pioneer of that new society is the International Working Men's Association."
-- (Address of July 23rd, 1870.)</p>
<p class="fst">
Up to the proclamation of the Republic, the members of the Paris Federal
Council remained in prison, while the other members of the Association
were daily denounced to the mob as traitors acting in the pay of Prussia.</p>
<p>With the capitulation of Sedan, when the second empire ended as
it began, by a parody, the Franco-German War entered upon its second phase.
It became war against the French people. After her repeated solemn declarations
to take lip arms for the sole purpose of repelling foreign aggression,
Prussia now dropped the mask and proclaimed a war of conquest. From that
moment she found herself compelled not only to fight the Republic in France,
but simultaneously the International in Germany. We can here hut hint at
a few incidents of that conflict.</p>
<p>Immediately after the declaration of war, the greater part of
the territory of the North German Confederation, Hanover, Oldenburg, Bremen,
Hamburg, Brunswick, Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg, Pomerania, and the
province of Prussia, were placed in a state of siege and handed over to
the tender mercies of General Vogel von Falkenstein. This state of siege
proclaimed as a safeguard against the threatening foreign invasion was
at once turned into a state of war against the German Internationals.</p>
<p>The day after the proclamation of the Republic at Paris, the Brunswick
Central Committee of the German Democratic Socialist Working Men's Party,
which forms a section of the International within the limits imposed by
the law of the country, issued a manifesto (5th September) calling upon
the working class to oppose by all means in their power the dismemberment
of France to claim a peace honourable for that country, and to agitate
for the recognition of the French Republic. <a href="#n5">[5]</a> The manifesto
denounced the proposed annexation of Alsace and Lorraine as a crime tending
to transform all Germany into a Prussian barracks and to establish war
as a permanent European institution. On the 9th September, Vogel von Falkenstein
had the members of the Brunswick Committee arrested and marched off in
chains a distance of 600 miles, to Loctzen, a Prussian fortress, on the
Russian frontier, where their ignominious treatment was to serve as a foil
to the ostentations feasting of the Imperial guest at Wilhelmshöhe.
<i>[Castle of the Prussian kings where Napoleon III, former Emperor of
France, was held prisoner by the Prussians from September 5, 1870 to March
19, 1871]</i> As arrests, the hunting of workmen from one German state
to another, suppression of proletarian papers, military brutality, and
police-chicane in all forms, did not prevent the International vanguard
of the German working class from acting up to the Brunswick manifesto,
Vogel von Falkenstein, by an ukase of September 21st [1870], interdicted
all meetings of the Democratic Socialist party. That interdict was cancelled
by another ukase of October 5th wherein he naively commands the police
spies</p>
<p class="quoteb">"to denounce to him personally all individuals who, by public demonstrations,
shall encourage France in her resistance against the conditions of peace
imposed by Germany, so as to enable him to render such individuals innocuous
during the continuance of the war".</p>
<p class="fst">
Leaving the cares of the war abroad to Moltke, the King of Prussia contrived
to give a new turn to the war at home. By his personal order of the 17th
October, Vogel von Falkenstein was to lend his Loetzen captives to the
Brunswick District Tribunal, the which, on its part, was either to find
grounds for their legal durance, or else return them to the safe keeping
of the dread general.</p>
<p>Vogel von Falkenstein's proceedings were, of course, imitated
throughout Germany, while Bismarck, in a diplomatic circular, mocked Europe
by standing forth as the indignant champion of the right of free utterance
of opinion, free press, and free meetings, on the part of the peace party
in France. At the very same time that he demanded a freely elected National
Assembly for France, in Germany he had Bebel and Liebknecht imprisoned
for having, in opposition to him, represented the International in the
German Parliament, and in order to get them out of the way during the impending
general elections. <a href="#n6">[6]</a> His master, William the Conqueror,
supported him, by a decree from Versailles, prolonging the state of siege,
that is to say, the suspension of all civil law, for the whole period of
the elections. In fact, the King did not allow the state of siege to he
raised in Germany until two months after the conclusion of peace with France.
The stubbornness with which lie was insisting upon the state of war at
home, and his repeated personal meddling with his own German captives,
prove the awe in which he, amidst the din of victorious arms and the frantic
cheers of the whole middle class, held the rising party of the proletariat.
It was the involuntary homage paid by physical force to moral power.</p>
<p>If the war against the International had been localised, first
in France, from the days of the plebiscite to the downfall of the Empire,
then in Germany during the whole period of the resistance of the Republic
against Prussia, it became general since the rise, and after the fall,
of the Paris Commune.</p>
<p>On the 6th of June, 1871, Jules Favre issued his circular to the
Foreign Powers demanding the extradition of the refugees of the Commune
as common criminals, and a general crusade against the International as
the enemy of family, religion, order, and property, so adequately represented
in his own person. <a href="#n7">[7]</a> Austria and Hungary caught the
cue at once. On the 13th June a raid was made on the reputed leaders of
the Pesth Working Men's Union their papers were seized their persons sequestered
and proceedings were instituted against them for high treason. <a href="#n8">[8]</a>
Several delegates of the Vienna International happening to be on a visit
to Pesth, were carried off to Vienna there to undergo a similar treatment
Beust asked and received from his parliament a supplementary vote of £30,000</p>
<p class="quoteb">"on behalf of expenses for political information that had become more
than ever indispensable through the dangerous spread of the International
all over Europe".</p>
<p class="fst">
Since that time a true reign of terror against the working class has set
in in Austria and Hungary. In its last agonies the Austrian Government
seems still anxiously to cling to its old privilege of playing the Don
Quixote of European reaction.</p>
<p>A few weeks after Jules Favre's circular, Dufaure proposed to
his rurals a law which is now in force, <a href="#n9">[9]</a> and punishes
as a crime the mere fact of belonging to the International Working Men's
Association, or of sharing its principles. As a witness before the rural
committee of enquiry on Dufaure's Bill, Thiers boasted that it was the
offspring of his own ingenious brains, and that he had been the first to
discover the infallible panacea of treating the Internationals as the Spanish
Inquisition had treated the heretics. But even on this point he can lay
no claim to originality. Long before his appointment as saviour of society,
the true law which the Internationals deserve at the bands of the ruling
classes had been laid down by the Vienna courts.</p>
<p>On the 26th July, 1870, the most prominent men of the Austrian
proletarian party were found guilty of high treason, and sentenced to years
of penal servitude, with one fast day in every month. The law laid down
was this: --</p>
<p>The prisoners, as they themselves confess, have accepted and acted according
to the programme of the German Working Men's Congress of Eisenach (1869).
This programme embodies the programme of the International. The International
is established for the emancipation of the working class from the rule
of the propertied class, and from political dependence. That emancipation
is incompatible with the existing institutions of the Austrian state. Hence,
whoever accepts and propagates the principles of the International programme,
commits preparatory acts for the overthrow of the Austrian Government,
and is consequently guilty of high treason.</p>
<p>On the 27th November, 1871, judgment was passed upon the members
of the Brunswick Committee. They were sentenced to various periods of imprisonment.
The court expressly referred, as to a precedent, to the law laid down at
Vienna.</p>
<p>At Pesth, the prisoners belonging to the Working Men's Union,
after having undergone for nearly a year a treatment as infamous as that
inflicted upon the Fenians by the British Government, were brought up for
judgment on the 22nd April, 1872. The public prosecutor, here also, called
upon the court to apply to them the law laid down at Vienna. They were,
however, acquitted.</p>
<p>At Leipzig, on the 27th March, 1872, Bebel and Liebknecht were
sentenced to two years imprisonment in a fortress for attempted high treason
upon the strength of the law as laid down at Vienna. The only distinctive
feature of this case is that the law laid down by a Vienna judge was sanctioned
by a Saxon jury.</p>
<p>At Copenhagen the three members of the Central Committee of the
International, Brix, Pio, and Geleff, were thrown into prison on the 5th
of May [1872] because they had declared their firm resolve to hold an open
air meeting in the teeth of a police order forbidding it. Once in prison
they were told that the accusation against them was extended, that tile
socialist ideas in themselves were incompatible with the existence of the
Danish state and that consequently the mere act of propagating them constituted
a clime against the Danish constitution. Again the law as laid down in
Vienna! The accused are still in prison awaiting their trial.</p>
<p>The Belgian government distinguished by its sympathetic reply
to Jules Favre's demand of extradition made haste to propose, through Malou,
a hypocritical counterfeit of Dufaure's law.</p>
<p>His Holiness Pope Pius IX gave vent to his feelings in an allocation
to a deputation of Swiss Catholics.</p>
<p class="quoteb">"Your government," said he, "which is republican thinks itself bound
to make a heavy sacrifice for what is called liberty. It affords an asylum
to a goodly number of individuals of the worst character. It tolerates
that sect of the International which desires to treat all Europe as it
has treated Paris. These gentlemen of the International who are no gentlemen,
are to he feared because they work for the account of the everlasting enemy
of God and mankind. What is to be gained by protecting them! One must pray
for them."</p>
<p class="fst">
Hang them first and pray for them afterwards!</p>
<p>Supported by Bismarck, Beust, and Stieber, the Prussian spy-in-chief,
the Emperors of Austria and Germany met at Salzburg in the beginning of
September, 1871, for the ostensible purpose of founding a holy alliance
against the International Working Men's Association.</p>
<p class="quoteb">"Such a European Alliance," declared the <i>North German Gazette</i>,
Bismarck's private <i>Moniteur</i>, "is the only possible salvation of
state, church, property, civilisation, in one word, of everything that
constitutes European states."</p>
<p class="fst">
Bismarck's real object, of course, was to prepare alliances for an impending
war with Russia and the International was held up to Austria as a piece
of red cloth is held up to a bull.</p>
<p>Lanza suppressed the International in Italy by simple decree.
Sagasta declared it an outlaw in Spain, <a href="#n10">[10]</a> probably
with a view to curry favour with the English stock exchange. The Russian
government which, since the emancipation of the serfs, has been driven
to the dangerous expedient of making timid concessions to popular claims
today, and withdrawing them tomorrow, found in the general line and cry
against the International a pretext for a recrudescence of reaction at
home. Abroad, with the intention of prying into the secrets of our Association,
it succeeded in inducing a Swiss judge to search, in presence of a Russian
spy, the house of Outine. a Russian International, and the editor of the
Geneva <i>Egalité</i>, the organ of our Romance Federation. <a href="#n11">[11]</a>
The republican government of Switzerland has only been prevented by the
agitation of the Swiss Internationals from handing up to Thiers refugees
of the Commune.<a id="ireland"> </a></p>
<p>Finally, the government of Mr. Gladstone, unable to act in Great
Britain, at least set forth its good intentions by the police terrorism
exercised in Ireland against our sections then in course of formation,
and by ordering its representatives abroad to collect information with
respect to the International Working Men's Association.</p>
<p>But all the measures of repression which the combined government
intellect of Europe was capable of devising, vanish into nothing before
the war of calumny undertaken by the lying power of the civilised world.
Apocryphal histories and mysteries of the International, shameless forgeries
of public documents and private letters, sensational telegrams, followed
each other in rapid succession; all the sluices of slander at the disposal
of the venal respectable press were opened at once to set free a deluge
of infamy in which to drown the execrated foe. This war of calumny finds
no parallel in history for the truly international area over which it has
spread, and for the complete accord in which it has been carried on by
all shades of ruling class opinion. When the great conflagration took place
at Chicago, the telegraph round the world announced it as the infernal
deed of the International; and it is really wonderful that to its demoniacal
agency has not been attributed the hurricane ravaging the West Indies.</p>
<p>In its former annual reports, the General Council used to give
a review of the progress of the Association since the meeting of the preceding
Congress. You will appreciate, citizens, the motives which induce us to
abstain from that course upon this occasion. Moreover, the reports of the
delegates from the various countries, who know best how far their discretion
may extend, will in a measure make up for this deficiency. We confine ourselves
to the statement that since the Congress at Basle, and chiefly since the
London Conference of September 1871, the International has been extended
to the Irish in England and to Ireland itself, to Holland, Denmark, and
Portugal, that it has been firmly organised in the United States, and that
it has established ramifications in Buenos Aires, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The difference between a working class without an International,
and a working class with an International, becomes most evident if we look
back to the period of 1848. Years were required for the working class itself
to recognise the Insurrection of June, 1848, as the work of its own vanguard.
The Paris Commune was at once acclaimed by the universal proletariat.</p>
<p>You, the delegates of the working class, meet to strengthen the
militant organisation of a society aiming at the emancipation of labour
and the extinction of national feuds. Almost at the same moment, there
meet at Berlin the crowned dignitaries of the old world in order to forge
new chains and to hatch new wars. <a href="#n12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Long life to the International Working Men's Association!</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="fst"><a id="n1"></a><span class="term">1</span> On April 23 1870, the French government
published a decree on holding a plebiscite on May 8 1870, the purpose of
which was to bolster up the shaky position of the government of Napoleon
III. The question was so formulated that it was impossible to express disapproval
of the Second Empire's policy without at the same time opposing all democratic
reforms</p>
<p>On April 24 1870, the newspaper <i>La Marseillaise</i> No. 125
carried a protest against the plebiscite launched by the Paris Federation
of the international and the Federal Syndicalist Chamber. It was printed
as a leaflet entitled <i>Manifeste antiplébiscitaire des Sections
parisiennes fédérées de l'Internationale et de lá
Chambre fédérale des Sociétés ouvrières</i>,
Paris, 1870. (Anti-Plebiscite Manifesto Published by the Federation of
the Paris Sections of the International and by the Federal Chamber of Workers'
Societies.)</p>
<p class="fst"><a id="n2"></a><span class="term">2</span> Reference to General Council statement
(by Marx) entitled "On the Persecution of Members of the French Sections."</p>
<p class="fst"><a id="n3"></a><span class="term">3</span> Marx is referring to <i>Papiers et
correspondance de la Famille impériale</i> (Papers and Correspondence
of the Royal Family) in two volumes published in Paris in 1870-71 -- the
first volume of which contains Minister Ollivier's orders for the arrests
of members of the International.</p>
<p class="fst"><a id="n4"></a><span class="term">4</span> This refers to the third trial of
members of the Paris organisation of the International which was held from
June 22 to July 8 1870. Put on trial: 38 activists in the workers' movement
-- including Varlin (he managed to flee), Frankel, Johannard, Avrial, Chalain.
The accused were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment -- from two
months to a year -- and were fined.</p>
<p class="fst"><a id="n5"></a><span class="term">5</span> The Brunswick Committee of the German
Social-Democratic Workers' Party issued on September 5 1870 a manifesto
"An alle deutschen Arbeiter" ("To All German Workers"). It was published
in the newspaper <i>Der Volkstaat</i> No. 73, September 11 1870. But on
September 9 1870, all members of the Brunswick Committee were arrested.</p>
<p class="fst"><a id="n6"></a><span class="term">6</span> On November 16 1870, during a debate
in the German Reichstag on the question of fresh loans for the war against
France, Bebel and Liebknecht demanded a ban on war loans and the immediate
conclusion of a peace treaty without annexations with the French Republic.
On December 17 1870, Bebel and, somewhat later, Liebknecht, were arrested.
During the general elections in March 1871, Bebel was re-elected Deputy
to the Reichstag as a sign of protest.</p>
<p class="fst"><a id="n7"></a><span class="term">7</span> This refers to Jules Favre's circular
to the diplomatic representatives of France abroad (of June 6 1871), in
which he called upon all governments to join forces in the struggle against
the International. The circular, which demanded the extradition of the
Commune refugees as criminals, was dated May 16 1871.</p>
<p class="fst"><a id="n8"></a><span class="term">8</span> The <i>General Working Men's Union</i>
-- The first socialist organisation in Hungary, whose activities spread
to Pest, the capital, and to major industrial towns. The Union carried
on socialist propaganda and led the strike movement of the workers. Its
leaders (Karoly Farkas, Antal Ihrlinger, Victor Külföldi) were
members of the Hungarian section of the International Working Men's Association
and had contacts with Austrian and German Social-Democrats and directly
with Marx. On June 11 1871, the Union organised a demonstration of solidarity
with the Paris Commune. In this connection, the government dissolved the
Union, while its leaders and the representatives of the Austrian workers'
movement who had come from Vienna were arrested on a charge of high treason.
But they were acquitted owning to a lack of evidence and under pressure
of public opinion.</p>
<p class="fst"><a id="n9"></a><span class="term">9</span> This law was adopted by the French
National Assembly on March 14 1872.</p>
<p class="fst"><a id="n10"></a><span class="term">10</span> This refers to a circular from Lanza,
Italian Home Minister, of August 14 1871, in which he ordered the dissolution
of the International's sections.</p>
<p class="fst"><a id="n11"></a><span class="term">11</span> The search of Utin's house in Geneva
and inspection of his personal papers and documents of the International
took place from January 16 to 28 1872. The cantonal Council of the Geneva
sections adopted a special resolution on February 6, in which it sharply
protested against this collusion of all the European governments against
the International. The General Council of the International, in its turn,
adopted a declaration denouncing the police arbitrariness of the Swiss
authorities.</p>
<p class="fst"><a id="n12"></a><span class="term">12</span> This refers to a meeting of the
emperors of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia which took place in Berlin
in September 1872 and which was an attempt to restore the reactionary alliance
of these states. On its agenda there was also the question of the joint
struggle against the revolutionary movement.</p>

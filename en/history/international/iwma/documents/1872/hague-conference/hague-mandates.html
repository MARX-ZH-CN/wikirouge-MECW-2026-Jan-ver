<h3>Mandate of N. Zhukovsky </h3>
<p class="fst"><span class="context">[Seven of the eight-page mandate bear round stamp: "International Working Men's Association. Propaganda and Socialist Revolutionary Action
Section. No duties without rights and no rights without duties. Liberty,
equality, solidarity. Geneva".]</span></p>
<p>
International Working Men's Association
<br>Geneva Propaganda and Socialist Revolutionary Action Section
<p>Sitting of August 30, 1872
<p>The Geneva Propaganda, etc. Section at its
sitting of August 30 charged Citizen Zhukovsky, a member of the section,
to represent it at the Hague Congress with the following imperative mandate:</p>
<p>
Considering that the principle of autonomy, which excludes any idea
of authoritarianism, was accepted as a basis of the organisation of the
International Working Men's Association at the First Congress of the Association,
held at Geneva in 1866;</p>
<p>Considering that as a result of administrative dispositions taken
by subsequent congresses this fundamental principle has been disregarded
by the London General Council, which has permitted itself to change our
Rules and to publish an official edition of them whereas this right belongs
only to the general congresses;</p>
<p>Considering that this fact has caused disorganisation in the whole
of the Association at the very moment when the fall of the Paris Commune
should have moved us to rally all the Association's forces from the point
of view of propaganda and action;</p>
<p>Considering that such an order of things paralyses the Association's
forces,
<p>
The Propaganda and Socialist Revolutionary Action Section accedes to the
proposal of the General Council which places a revision of the Rules on
the agenda.</p>
<p class="fst">
<b>I.</b> The Section declares, moreover, that the federative
principle should serve as the basis of the organisation of the International
Working Men's Association, which consists of autonomous sections in the
federations and of autonomous federations in the Association.
<p>The sections should organise by trades according to all the various
branches of production, but it is absolutely necessary that alongside these
corporative sections there should be sections of study and of propaganda
which take names and titles according to their convenience.
<p>The sections of study and propaganda are indispensable for the
following reason: the corporative sections are obliged to devote all their
time to matters of their trade, that is, to organising resistance to Capital.
Questions of principle are necessarily neglected by them and this is the
reason why the workers belonging to the Association are often ignorant
of its aim and principle and disregard entirely tile principal resolutions
of the congresses. Every man who is forced to earn his living by work which
exhausts him without sufficiently providing for his needs is revolutionary
and socialist by instinct, but in order to change the face of things instinct
must be transformed into consciousness, which can be done only by study.</p>
<p class="fst">
<b>II.</b> The sections should federate freely from the double
point of view of resistance to capital by industrial regions and resistance
to the political power of the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy by nations.
<p>The sections' link between themselves is the Federal Committee,
whose functions are those of a simple correspondence and statistics bureau.
The regional federal committee has the right to suspend a section until
the next regional congress, which is the only judge in the matter.
<p>The federal committees may well correspond with one another, but
a central statistics bureau for the whole Association is indispensable
and, considering that the General Council, which was initially useful,
has become not only useless, but harmful, the delegate of the Section will
have to demand:</p>
<p class="fst">
1. The abolition of the said General Council;</p>
<p class="fst">
2. The organisation of a central correspondence and statistics bureau, appointed
no longer by the congress, but by the regional federations on the basis
of from one to three members of each federation. This bureau will keep
a register of the sections and will publish a bulletin of the Association,
a subscription of ten francs a year per member being paid into the treasury
of the bureau. Those sections which do not make this payment before February
1 of each year will be deprived of the right of representation at the following
congress.</p>
<p>
The bulletin of the Association shall contain only an exact account of
the working-class movement, without ever dealing with the disagreements
between the sections and federations and without ever touching on questions
of principle, these questions having to be dealt with by the federations
themselves in their newspapers.</p>
<br>
<p>One copy of this bulletin will be sent free of charge to every
section of the International.</p>
<p class="fst">
<b>III.</b> The congress will name in advance two towns where
the next congress will be held, the first town named having priority; in
case of some hindrance as regards this town, the central bureau will name
another one after consulting the federations. It goes without saying that
the place of assembly of the congress must as far as possible be the most
central point in Europe.</p>
<p class="fst">
<b>IV.</b> The delegate of the Section shall protest:</p>
<p class="fst">1. Against the General Council's choice of the place of assembly of the present Congress.</p>
<p class="fst">2. Against the private circular which the said General Council permitted itself
to publish whereas no International congress has given it the right to
launch manifestos.</p>
<p class="fst">
<b>V.</b> In order to ensure success of the work of the Congress, that
is to say, to bring back to the International Working Men's Association
the unity which it is losing, the delegate shall:</p>
<p class="fst">1. Support all proposals tending to give the Association institutions sanctioning
the most complete autonomy of groups by excluding all power and authoritarian
dispositions.</p>
<p class="fst">2. Insist that all discussions of persons be absolutely and rigorously excluded
from the deliberations of the Congress.</p>
<p class="fst">
<b>VI.</b> In the event of questions of principle being placed on the agenda
of the Hague Congress, the delegate of the section of propaganda and socialist
revolutionary action shall develop them from the following triple point
of view:</p>
<p class="fst">
I. Abolition of the State by a Federation of Communes.</p>
<p class="fst">
II. Abolition of property by the collective force of the workers organised
in groups according to production and collectively possessing the instruments
of labour.</p>
<p class="fst">
III. Abolition of the Churches, religions and religious congregations and
also of all associations connected with them by integrated education.</p>

<h3>Mandate of Harriet Law </h3>
<p class="fst"><span class="context">[Left corner bears oval stamp: "International Working Men's Association, Geneva. Central Section of Working Women"]</span></p>
<p>
Geneva, August 30, 1872
<p>Mademoiselle,
<p>The Central Section of Working Women requests
you to accept its thanks for your obliging offer to represent it at the
Hague Congress. In accepting your good offices it knows, Mademoiselle,
that it cannot confide its cause to an advocate more worthy of defending
it and more capable of ensuring its triumph.</p>
<p>
Greetings and solidarity.
<p class="fst" style="margin-left: 100px;">
In the name of the Section,<br>
the Secretary, V. Tinayre</p>
<h5>To Mlle Harriet Law</h5>
<p>Hereby the Central Section of Working Women empowers Mademoiselle
Harriet Law to represent it at the General Congress at The Hague.
<p>This mandate is imperative. Mademoiselle Law will not be
free to depart from the terms in which it is conceived (in her capacity
as representative of the Section). The givers of the mandate protest in
advance against anything which the holder might say or do outside that
which is prescribed to her herein.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle Law will make known to the Congress and in case of
need develop the following wishes:</p>
<p>Considering, first:</p>
<p>
That the working woman's needs are equal to those of the working man
and that the pay for her work is much less,</p>
<p>The Central Section of Working Women requests the Congress to
include in its resolutions that henceforth</p>
<p>Agreements reached between employers and strikers of a trade in
which women are employed will stipulate the same advantages for them as
for men as this has been adopted by the Congress of the Romance Federation
held this year at Vevey.</p>
<p>
Considering, secondly:</p>
<p>
That the more different groups of opinion there are on the ways of
achieving the same aim, the emancipation of labour, the easier it
is to generalise the working-class movement without losing any of the forces
(even the most widely diverging) to concur in the final result;</p>
<p>That it is advisable to leave to individuals, within the principles
of the International, the right to group according to their tastes and
their opinions.</p>
<p>
Consequently:</p>
<p>
The Working Women of the Central Section demand:
<p>That the General Council shall not have the power to reject any
section, whatever particular purpose it proposes, whatever its principles,
provided that purpose and principles are not capable of harming those of
the International Working Men's Association and are compatible with the
General Rules.</p>

<p class="fst">Section No. 1,<br>

North America,<br>
10 Ward Hotel<br>
To Karl Marx in London</p>
<p>Dear Comrade,</p>
<p>I have to inform you that at the sitting
of July 28 you were appointed delegate of the above-named section to the
general Hague Congress and that we are expecting you in accordance with
our choice to represent New York Section No. 1 at the said Congress.</p>
<p>Your mandate will be sent to you through one of our delegates
to Congress, on their arrival in Europe.</p>
<p>According to a decision at the same sitting, July 28, your instructions
for the Hague Congress are that, in common with our delegate going out
direct from here, you will have strictly to support the Congress decisions
of the North American Federation, which, in substance, aim at a taut organisation
and above all centralisation in the fullest sense of the word, and are
directed against the machinations of Bakunin, Guillaume and their
associates, who intend to decentralise the International Working Men's
Association in order to gain more elbow room for their personal intrigues
and to cripple our movement.</p>
<p>Section No. 1 of New York was prevented this time by the Congress
of our Federation from asserting its view on the need for a revision of
the General Rules in the form of decisions, and we therefore leave it to
you to act according to your own judgment in this matter at the Hague Congress
as well as in all other matters that are discussed or decided at this Congress.</p>
<p>Section No. 1 of New York is fully aware that, in appointing you
as their delegate, they carry the responsibility for any expenses you may
incur, but I must explain to you that at the moment our funds are completely
exhausted and even the smallest expenditure is impossible.</p>
<p>The importance of the Hague Congress demands despite this fact
that we be directly represented, and we hope you will find ways and means
of achieving this even without our help.</p>

<h3>Imperative Mandate of the Portuguese Federation to its Delegate at the Hague Congress</h3>
<p>
The undersigned, delegates of the various sections
of the International Working Men's Association assembled at a meeting of
the local Lisbon Council,</p>
<p>Being informed by the newspapers of the polemics which have been
publicly raised by the members of the Alliance of Socialist Democracy in
different countries;</p>
<p>Considering that the conduct of the Alliance has produced lamentable
consequences for the prestige of the International Working Men's Association;</p>
<p>That its purpose is to dominate and disorganise our Association
and to direct the working class towards a particular aim;</p>
<p>That if there is a reason for accusing the General Council this
accusation should have been submitted to the consideration of the sections,
resolved within their framework and sanctioned by the Congress;</p>
<p>Considering also that the conduct of the Italian sections is contrary
to the letter and the spirit of the General Rules of the International;
<p>That the said sections have committed an act of despotism by arrogating
the authority to convene a General Congress, thus violating the basic principle
of the Statute;</p>
<p>For all these reasons we propose:</p>
<p class="fst">1. In respect of the Alliance:</p>
<p>That it be declared a society dangerous and highly prejudicial
to the economic emancipation of the working class and that the Congress
must act with energy against it.</p>
<p class="fst">2. In respect of the Italian sections:</p>
<p>That their resolution relative to the convening of a General Congress
be considered as a violation of the basic principle of the Statute which
unites all the members of the International.</p>

<h3>Imperative Mandate given to the Jura Delegates for The Hague Congress</h3>
<p>
The delegates of the Jura Federation are given
an imperative mandate to present to the Congress of The Hague the following
principles as the basis of the organisation of the International.</p>
<p>Any group of workers which adheres to the programme of the International
as it has been defined by the preamble to the General Rules voted at the
Geneva Congress, and which undertakes to observe economic solidarity in
respect of all the workers and groups <b>of </b>workers in the struggle
against monopoly capital is a section of the International enjoying full
rights.</p>
<p>The federative principle being the basis of the organisation of
the International, the sections federate freely among themselves and the
federations federate freely among themselves with full autonomy, setting
up according to their needs all the organs of correspondence, statistics
bureaus, etc., which they judge to be suitable.</p>
<p>The Jura Federation sees as a consequence of the above-mentioned
principles the abolition of the General Council and the suppression of
all authority in the International.</p>
<p>The Jura delegates must act in complete solidarity with the Spanish,
Italian and French delegates and all those who protest frankly and broadly
against the authoritarian principle. Consequently, refusal to admit a delegate
of these federations must lead to the immediate withdrawal of the Jura
delegates.</p>
<p>Similarly, if the Congress does not accept the organizational
bases of the International set forth above, the delegates will have to
withdraw in agreement with the delegates of the anti-authoritarian federations.</p>
<p>As far as will he possible, the Jura delegates will eliminate
all personal questions and will hold discussion in that field only when
they are forced to do so, proposing to the Congress oblivion of the past
and for the future the election of courts of honour, which will have to
take a decision every time an accusation is levelled against a member of
the International. Any accuser not supporting his accusations with positive
proofs will be excluded from the Association as a slanderer.</p>

<h3>
Imperative Mandate given by the Spanish Federation to Comrades Nicolas Alonso Marselau, Tomas Gonzales Morago, Rafael Farga Pellicer and Carlos Alerini, its Delegates to the International Congress</h3>
<p class="fst">1. We have seen with profound bitterness that the General Council has named
the place of assembly of the Congress without consulting the different
regional federations;</p>
<p>We have seen with regret that it has named The Hague for the assembly
of the Congress, because it is thus impossible for various regions to send
the number of representatives they would have been able to send had a more
central place been named;</p>
<p>And because tendencies opposed to the General Council have been
manifested in the southern regions of Europe, it appears there has been
a deliberate intention of causing these regions to have the smallest possible
number of representatives at this Congress;</p>
<p>Because of all this the delegates must demonstrate to the Congress
that the General Council has violated the principles of justice.</p>
<p class="fst">2. Not considering as equitable the principle observed up to the present International
Congress of voting according to the number of delegates, we request: that
the votes be counted according to the number of those represented by the
delegates holding an imperative mandate, which must show the number of
individuals who are represented; that the votes of those represented by
delegates not provided with an imperative mandate will not count until
the sections or federations which they represent have discussed and voted
on the questions debated at the Congress.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the implementation of the said principle and
that the resolutions of the Congress shall be the true expression of the
will of the International Working Men's Association, these resolutions
shall not enter into force before two months have elapsed, in which time
the sections or federations which have not provided their delegates with
an imperative mandate on the questions discussed and also those which have
not been able to send delegates will express their vote by publishing it
in the newspapers of the International and by taking part in the Regional
Council which will be entrusted with this mission.</p>
<p>In the event of the Congress persisting in the traditional system
of voting, our delegates will take part in the discussion, but will abstain
from voting.</p>
<p>The Belgian Federal Council will be entrusted with counting the
votes of the different sections or federations which, because they have
not empowered a delegate or have not provided him with an imperative mandate
on the questions debated, have to express their opinion.</p>
<p class="fst">3. Only the administrative resolutions of the Congresses, sanctioned by the
vote of the sections or federations, will be obliging for all members of
the International. There will be voting on questions of principle only
to show which opinion is so far most accepted; but resolutions on these
questions will not be binding.</p>
<p class="fst">4. The General Council has no authority whatsoever over the sections and federations.
As it is today it should be abolished; its functions shall be those of
an intermediary between the different regional federations; for which its
activity shall be limited to that of a mere correspondence and statistics
centre, leaving it full freedom of initiative to propose to the different
regions or to the Congress the solutions which it finds most suitable by
reason of the data acquired through correspondence and statistics.</p>
<p class="fst">5. The General Council should be located in Brussels until the next Congress.</p>
<p>The Belgian Federal Council will be charged with:</p>
<p>Counting the votes of the different sections and federations which,
because they have not sent delegates or because they have not provided
them with an imperative mandate on the questions debated, have to express
their opinion.</p>
<p>Installing in its functions, after two months have elapsed since
the Congress, the General Council which will be elected.</p>
<p class="fst">6. The General Council will be composed of two members for each regional federation,
who will be nominated directly by the respective federations and can be
recalled only by them.</p>
<p class="fst">7. The responsibility for our Italian brothers' break with the General Council
rests with the latter exclusively; if the Italian members of the International
despite this send their delegates to the Congress of The Hague we declare
that our delegates will always be on their side so long as they support
the banner of revolution as at present.</p>
<p>In the event of the Italians persisting in holding the Congress
which they have convened in Neuchâtel either at the same time as,
or after the termination of, the Congress of The Hague, our delegates,
once they have ended their mission at the Congress, will pass through Neuchâtel
in order to take part in the said Congress or to obtain all the necessary
data to render an account on their return of all that can be of interest
to us concerning this grand and transcendental question.</p>
<p class="fst">8. Our delegates shall by all possible means accessible to them secure the
unity of the International; but without renouncing in any way any one of
the revolutionary principles proclaimed by our Conference and regional
congresses.</p>
<p>For this purpose our delegates must come to an agreement with
the delegates of the Italian and Jura regions to defend in common the principles
which inspire both the regions, inasmuch as they are identical, inasmuch
as they are the same.</p>
<p class="fst">9. The delegates of the Spanish Federation will procure a copy of the minutes
of the sittings of the Congress of The Hague, as also of that of Neuchâtel,
so that all the local federations may acquaint themselves with them.</p>
<p class="fst">10. They will also procure a copy of the list of subscriptions made to the
General Council by all the regional federations, and especially those made
by the Spanish Federation, showing all the data and the growth from the
time of the Basle Congress until today.</p>
<p class="fst">11. Our delegates will bear in mind the following:</p>
<p>
It would be desirable to concretise the agenda of the Congress on the
different points which are to be debated; because the subject of the revision
of the General Rules and Regulations can contain so many and so complicated
questions, we point out to them that on all points not foreseen, for the
reason already given, in this mandate they must keep to the collectivistic,
decentralising, anarchistic and anti-authoritarian criterion, which is
the standard for members of the International in our Region, expressed
by the congresses of Barcelona and Saragossa and the Conference of Valencia.
They must bear in mind the formula adopted by the Conference of uniting
Humanity in a free world federation of free associations of agricultural
and industrial workers.</p>
<p class="fst">12. The delegates of the Spanish Region will observe this mandate in everything
and on their return will render an exact account of what they have done,
the first two to this Federal Council so that it can in turn pass it on
to all the local federations, and the two nominated directly by the Barcelona
Federation at the general meeting of the same which will be convened for
the purpose, without neglecting to give a written account of their conduct
to this Federal Council.</p>
<p class="fst">13. The activists of the Federation who have paid their subscription in the
course of this month number more than fifteen thousand members of
the International.</p>

<h1>Documents of the Hague Congress</h1>
<p class="information">
These documents, varying in character, contain
extensive material on the work of the International and on the working-
class movement in individual countries.</p>
<p class="information">
They include general and financial reports of the General Council,
the local reports of the North American Federal Council, a number of French
federations and sections, the Basle Section and the Italian Section at
Porto Maurizio, the Portuguese Federal Council and others, and also messages,
statements, greetings, and so on, sent to the Congress by local congresses,
federations, sections and individuals.</p>
<p class="information">
Though intended to be read aloud to the Congress, as the minutes
show, only a few of these documents so read -- due to lack of time. Instead,
they were generally passed on to a special commission, which was to read
them and then pass back to the Congress a summary report. (This task was
never completed, however.)</p>
<p class="information">
The detailed report drawn up by Engels on the financial administration
of the General Council since the time of tne London Conference (1871) and
the general balance of its income and expenses refute the calumny levelled
by the bourgeois press and by the Bakuninists against the leading members
of the General Council alleging their irresponsibility in spending the
funds collected by the workers. Marx observed that "whereas, as the accounts
show, individual members of the General Council were emptying their pockets
and purses for the organisation, it was mendaciously said that they were
living on the pennies of the workers!"</p>
<p class="information">
French sections submitted proposals to improve the International's
organisation. Proposals by the Portuguese and the North American federations
wanted to strengthen the role of the General Council, demanded a stricter
approach to the admission of new members and to the approval of new sections,
and emphasised the importance of centralising the proletariat's forces,
of strengthening its unity and its ideological cohesion based on the principles
of the International.</p>
<p class="information">
The Paris, Narbonne and Ronen sections noted the success achieved
by the working-class movement, duly recognised the merits of the General
Council in respect of the working class and demanded that the Council should
be given wider powers to fight against splitters within the Association
and against international reaction.</p>
<p class="information">
The Portuguese workers, who were the victims of particularly cruel
exploitation and had only recently taken the path of independent political
activity, wrote in their address to the Congress that the organisation
of the working class was an indispensable condition for its emancipation
"and that the existence of the General Council, which has been discussed
so much, is indispensable, and if there were no General Council it would
have to be created."</p>
<p class="information">
The New Madrid Federation saw the main task of the Congress in
strengthening and extending the organisation, reorganising "it so that
it can better achieve its aim ... so that it... may be practically effective".
Discerning a serious danger in the secret intrigues of the Bakuninist Alliance
and calling for the expulsion of sectarians from the International, the
Spaniards appealed to the Association's General Congress delegates for
energetic action.</p>
<p class="information">
From Germany, Switzerland, Britain, Spain and other countries
letters and telegrams arrived at the Congress containing greetings and
expressions of solidarity with the delegates and calling for a courageous
and persistent struggle to achieve working-class unity.</p>

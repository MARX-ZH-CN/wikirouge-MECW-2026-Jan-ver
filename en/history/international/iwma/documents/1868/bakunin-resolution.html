Just about a month ago, a certain number of citizens
formed in Geneva the Central Initiating Committee of a new international
society named the International Alliance of Socialist Democracy, stating
that it was their "special mission to study political and philosophical
questions on the basis of the grand principles of... equality, etc." the
program and rules printed by this Initiating Committee were only communicated
to the General Council of the International Working Men's Association at
its meeting on December 15. According to these documents, the said International
Alliance is "established entirely within the... International Working Men's
Association", at the same time as it is established entirely outside of
the Association.</p>
<p>Besides the General Council of the International Association,
elected at the Geneva, Lausanne, and Brussels workingmen's congresses,
there is to be, in line with the initiating rules, another Central Council
in Geneva, which is self-appointed. Besides the local groups of the International
Association, there are to be local groups of the International Alliance,
which "through their... national bureaus", operating outside the national
bureaus of the International Association, "will ask the Central Bureau
of the Alliance to admit them into the International Working Men's Association";
the Alliance Central Committee thereby takes upon itself the right of admittance
to the International Association. Lastly, the General Congress of the International
Association will have its parallel in the General Congress of the International
Alliance, for, as the initiating rules say, "At the annual Working Men's
Congress, the delegation of the Alliance of Socialist Democracy, as a branch
of the International Working Men's Association, will hold public meetings
in a separate building."</p>
<p>Considering,</p>
<p class="fst" style="margin-left: 100px;">That the presence of a second international body operating within and
outside the International Working Men's Association will be the most infallible
means of its disorganization;</p>
<p class="fst" style="margin-left: 100px;">That every other group of individuals, anywhere at all, will have
the right to imitate the Geneva initiating group and, under more or less
plausible excuses, to bring into the International Working Men's Association
other international associations with other "special missions";</p>
<p class="fst" style="margin-left: 100px;">That the International Working Men's Association will thereby
soon become a plaything for intriguers of every race and nationality;</p>
<p class="fst" style="margin-left: 100px;">That the Rules of the International Working Men's Association
anyway admit only local and national branches into the Association (see
Article 1 and Article 6 of the Rules);</p>
<p class="fst" style="margin-left: 100px;">That sections of the International Association are forbidden to
give themselves rules or administrative regulations contrary to the General
Rules and Administrative Regulations of the International Association (see
Article 12 of the Administrative Regulations);</p>
<p class="fst" style="margin-left: 100px;">That the Rules and Administrative Regulations of the International
Association can only be revised by the General Congress in the event of
two-thirds of the delegates present voting in favor of such a revision
(see Article 13 of the Administrative Regulations).</p>
<p class="fst">
The General Council of the International Working Men's Association unanimously
agreed at its meeting of December 22, 1868, that:</p>
<ol class="numbered" style="margin-left: 100px;">
<li>
All articles of the Rules of the International Alliance of Socialist Democracy,
defining its relations with the International Working Men's Association,
are declared null and void;</li>
<li>
The International Alliance of Socialist Democracy may not be admitted as
a branch of the International Working Men's Association;</li>
<li>
These resolutions be published in all countries where the International
Working Men's Association exists.</li>
</ol>
<p class="fst">By order of the General Council<br>
of the International Working Men's Association</p>

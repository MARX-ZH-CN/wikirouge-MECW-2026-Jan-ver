<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="fst"><a id="n1"></a><span class="term">[1]</span>
In <i>The Commonwealth</i> this part reads:
"They also recommend to the Congress the election of a General Secretary
who shall be permanently engaged on the business of the Association, which
has now assumed such proportions as to make the above a necessity. They
also recommend that the rate of contributions for organised bodies be at
the rate of one half-penny per member per year, the cost price of cards
(livrets) to be charged extra." -- <i>Ed. Collected Works.</i></p>
<p class="fst"><a id="n2"></a><span class="term">[2]</span> After this the Minute Book has: "A
debate arose on this point. The recommendation was amended so as to require
that the Swiss members take the initiative at the Congress on this question.</p>
<p class="fst">"The resolution in its amended form was carried unanimously." -- <i>Ed.</i></p>

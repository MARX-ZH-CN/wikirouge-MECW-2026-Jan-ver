<h3>1.<br>
Organisation of the International Association</h3>
<p class="fst">Upon the whole, the Provisional Central Council recommend
the <i>plan of organisation</i> as traced in the Provisional Statutes.
Its soundness and facilities of adaptation to different countries without
prejudice to unity of action have been proved by two years' experience.
For the next year we recommend London as the seat of the Central Council,
the Continental situation looking unfavourable for change.</p>
<p>The members of the Central Council will of course be elected by
Congress (5 of the Provisional Statutes) with power to add to their number.</p>
<p>The <i>General Secretary</i> to be chosen by Congress for one
year and to be the only paid officer of the Association. We propose £2
for his weekly salary. [The French and German texts add: "The <i>Standing
Committee</i>, which is in fact an executive of the Central Council, to
be chosen by Congress, the function of any of its member to be defined
by the Central Council."]</p>
<p>The uniform <i>annual contribution of each individual member of
the Association</i> to be <i>one half penny</i> (perhaps one penny). The
cost price of cards of membership (carpets) to be charged extra.</p>
<p>While calling upon the members of the Association to form benefit
societies and connect them by an international link, we leave the initiation
of this question (<i>etablissement des societes de secours mutuels. Appoi
moral et materiel accorde aux orphelins de l'association</i> [foundation
of benefit societies; moral and material assistance to the Association's
orphans. -- <i>Ed.</i>]) to the Swiss who originally proposed it at the
conference of September last.</p>
<a id="02"></a>
<h3>2.<br>
International combination of efforts, by the agency of the association, in the struggle between labour and capital</h3>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">(a)</span>
From a general point of view, this question embraces
the whole activity of the International Association which aims at combining
and generalising the till now disconnected efforts for emancipation by
the working classes in different countries.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">(b)</span>
To counteract the intrigues of capitalists always
ready, in cases of strikes and lockouts, to misuse the foreign workman
as a tool against the native workman, is one of the particular functions
which our Society has hitherto performed with success. It is one of the
great purposes of the Association to make the workmen of different countries
not only <i>feel</i> but <i>act</i> as brethren and comrades in the army
of emancipation.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">(c)</span>
One great "International combination of efforts"
which we suggest is a <i>statistical inquiry into the situation of the
working classes of all countries to be instituted by the working classes
themselves</i>. To act with any success, the materials to be acted upon
must be known. By initiating so great a work, the workmen will prove their
ability to take their own fate into their own hands. We propose therefore:</p>
<p>That in each locality, where branches of our Association exist,
the work be immediately commenced, and evidence collected on the different
points specified in the subjoined scheme of inquiry.</p>
<p>That the Congress invite all workmen of Europe and the United
States of America to collaborate in gathering the elements of the statistics
of the working class; that reports and evidence be forwarded to the Central
Council. That the Central Council elaborate them into a general report,
adding the evidence as an appendix.</p>
<p>That this report together with its appendix be laid before the
next annual Congress, and after having received its sanction, be printed
at the expense of the Association.</p>
<h5>General Scheme of Inquiry, which may of course be modified by each Locality</h5>
<ol class="numbered">
<li>Industry, name of.</li>
<li>Age and sex of the employed.</li>
<li>Number of the employed.</li>

</ol>
<a id="03"></a>
<h3>3.<br>
Limitation of the working day</h3>
<p class="fst">A preliminary condition, without which all further
attempts at improvement and emancipation must prove abortive, is the <i>limitation
of the working day.</i></p>
<p>It is needed to restore the health and physical energies of the working
class, that is, the great body of every nation, as well as to secure them
the possibility of intellectual development, sociable intercourse, social
and political action.</p>
<p>We propose 8 <i>hours work</i> as the <i>legal limit</i> of the
working day. This limitation being generally claimed by the workmen of
the United States of America,'40 the vote of the Congress will raise it
to the common platform of the working classes all over the world.</p>
<p>For the information of continental members, whose experience of
factory law is comparatively short-dated, we add that all legal restrictions
will fail and be broken through by Capital if the <i>period of the day</i>
during which the 8 working hours must be taken, be not fixed. The length
of that period ought to be determined by the 8 working hours and the additional
pauses for meals. For instance, if the different interruptions for meals
amount to <i>one hour</i>, the legal period of the day ought to embrace
9 hours, say from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., or from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., etc. Nightwork
to be but exceptionally permitted, in trades or branches of trades specified
by law. The tendency must be to suppress all nightwork.</p>
<p>This paragraph refers only to adult persons, male or female, the
latter, however, to be rigorously excluded from all <i>nightwork whatever</i>,
and all sort of work hurtful to the delicacy of the sex, or exposing their
bodies to poisonous and otherwise deleterious agencies. By adult persons
we understand all persons having reached or passed the age of 18 years.</p>
<a id="04"></a>
<h3>4.<br>
Juvenile and children's labour (both sexes)</h3>
<p class="fst">We consider the tendency of modern industry to make
children and juvenile persons of both sexes co-operate in the great work
of social production, as a progressive, sound and legitimate tendency,
although under capital it was distorted into an abomination. In a rational
state of society <i>every child whatever</i>, from the age of 9 years,
ought to become a productive labourer in the same way that no able-bodied
adult person ought to be exempted from the general law of nature, viz.:
to work in order to be able to eat, and work not only with the brain but
with the hands too.</p>
<p>However, for the present, we have only to deal with the children
and young persons of both sexes divided into <i>three classes</i>, to be
treated differently <a href="#a">[a]</a>; the first class to range from
9 to 12; the second, from 13 to 15 years; and the third, to comprise the
ages of 16 and 17 years. We propose that the employment of the first class
in any workshop or housework be legally restricted to <i>two</i>; that
of the second, to <i>four</i>; and that of the third, to <i>six</i> hours.
For the third class, there must be a break of at least one hour for meals
or relaxation.</p>
<p>It may be desirable to begin elementary school instruction before
the age of 9 years; but we deal here only with the most indispensable antidotes
against the tendencies of a social system which degrades the working man
into a mere instrument for the accumulation of capital, and transforms
parents by their necessities into slave-holders, sellers of their own children.
The <i>right</i> of children and juvenile persons must be vindicated. They
are unable to act for themselves. It is, therefore, the duty of society
to act on their behalf.</p>
<p>If the middle and higher classes neglect their duties toward their
offspring, it is their own fault. Sharing the privileges of these classes,
the child is condemned to suffer from their prejudices.</p>
<p>The case of the working class stands quite different. The working
man is no free agent. In too many cases, he is even too ignorant to understand
the true interest of his child, or the normal conditions of human development.
However, the more enlightened part of the working class fully understands
that the future of its class, and, therefore, of mankind, altogether depends
upon the formation of the rising working generation. They know that, before
everything else, the children and juvenile workers must be saved from the
crushing effects of the present system. This can only be effected by converting
<i>social reason</i> into <i>social force</i>, and, under given circumstances,
there exists no other method of doing so, than through <i>general laws</i>,
enforced by the power of the state. In enforcing such laws, the working
class do not fortify governmental power. On the contrary, they transform
that power, now used against them, into their own agency. They effect by
a general act what they would vainly attempt by a multitude of isolated
individual efforts.</p>
<p>Proceeding from this standpoint, we say that no parent and no
employer ought to be allowed to use juvenile labour, except when combined
with education.</p>
<p>By education we understand three things.</p>
<p class="fst">Firstly: <i>Mental education.</i></p>
<p class="fst">Secondly: <i>Bodily education</i>, such as is given in schools of gymnastics,
and by military exercise.</p>
<p class="fst">Thirdly: <i>Technological training</i>, which imparts the general
principles of all processes of production, and, simultaneously initiates
the child and young person in the practical use and handling of the elementary
instruments of all trades. [The German text calls this "polytechnical training."
-- <i>Ed</i>]</p>
<p>
A gradual and progressive course of mental, gymnastic, and technological
training ought to correspond to the classification of the juvenile labourers.
The costs of the technological a schools ought to be partly met by the
sale of their products.</p>
<p>The combination of paid productive labour, mental education bodily
exercise and polytechnic training, will raise the working class far above
the level of the higher and middle classes.</p>
<p>It is self-understood that the employment of all persons from
9 and to 17 years (inclusively) in nightwork and all health-injuring trades
must be strictly prohibited by law.</p>
<a id="05"></a>
<h3>5.<br>
Co-operative labour</h3>
<p class="fst">It is the business of the International Working Men's
Association to combine and generalise the <i>spontaneous movements</i>
of the working classes, but not to dictate or impose any doctrinary system
whatever. The Congress should, therefore, proclaim no <i>special system</i>
of co-operation, but limit itself to the enunciation of a few general principles.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">(a)</span> We acknowledge the co-operative movement as
one of the transforming forces of the present society based upon class
antagonism. Its great merit is to practically show, that the present pauperising,
and despotic system of the <i>subordination of labour</i> to capital can
be superseded by the republican and beneficent system of <i>the association
of free and equal producers.</i></p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">(b)</span> Restricted, however, to the dwarfish forms into which
individual wages slaves can elaborate it by their private efforts, the
co-operative system will never transform capitalist society. to convert
social production into one large and harmonious system of free and co-operative
labour, <i>general social changes </i>are wanted, <i>changes of the general
conditions of society, </i>never to be realised save by the transfer of
the organised forces of society, viz., the state power, from capitalists
and landlords to the producers themselves.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">(c)</span> We recommend to the working men to embark in
<i>co-operative production</i> rather than in <i>co-operative stores.</i>
The latter touch but the surface of the present economical system, the
former attacks its groundwork.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">(d)</span> We recommend to all co-operative societies to
convert one part of their joint income into a fund for propagating their
principles by example as well as by precept, in other words, by promoting
the establishment by teaching and preaching.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">(e)</span> In order to prevent co-operative societies from
degenerating into ordinary middle-class joint stock companies (societes
par actions), all workmen employed, whether shareholders or not, ought
to share alike. As a mere temporary expedient, we are willing to allow
shareholders a low rate of interest.</p>
<a id="06"></a>
<h3>6.<br>
Trades' unions. Their past, present and future</h3>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">(a) Their past.</span></p>
<p>Capital is concentrated social force, while the workman has only to
dispose of his working force. The <i>contract</i> between capital and labour
can therefore never be struck on equitable terms, equitable even in the
sense of a society which places the ownership of the material means of
life and labour on one side and the vital productive energies on the opposite
side. The only social power of the workmen is their number. The force of
numbers, however is broken by disunion. The disunion of the workmen is
created and perpetuated by their <i>unavoidable competition among themselves.</i></p>
<p>Trades' Unions originally sprang up from the <i>spontaneous</i> attempts
of workmen at removing or at least checking that competition, in order
to conquer such terms of contract as might raise them at least above the
condition of mere slaves. The immediate object of Trades' Unions was therefore
confined to everyday necessities, to expediences for the obstruction of
the incessant encroachments of capital, in one word, to questions of wages
and time of labour. This activity of the Trades' Unions is not only legitimate,
it is necessary. It cannot be dispensed with so long as the present system
of production lasts. On the contrary, it must be generalised by the formation
and the combination of Trades' Unions throughout all countries. On the
other hand, unconsciously to themselves, the Trades' Unions were forming
<i>centres of organisation</i> of the working class, as the mediaeval municipalities
and communes did for the middle class. If the Trades' Unions are required
for the guerilla fights between capital and labour, they are still more
important as <i>organised agencies for superseding the very system of wages
labour and capital rule.</i></p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">(b) Their present.</span></p>
<p>Too exclusively bent upon the local and immediate struggles with capital,
the Trades' Unions have not yet fully understood their power of acting
against the system of wages slavery itself. They therefore kept too much
aloof from general social and political movements. Of late, however, they
seem to awaken to some sense of their great historical mission, as appears,
for instance, from their participation, in England, in the recent political
movement, from the enlarged views taken of their function in the United
States, and from the following resolution passed at the recent great conference
of Trades' delegates at Sheffield:</p>
<p>"That this Conference, fully appreciating the efforts made by
the International Association to unite in one common bond of brotherhood
the working men of all countries, most earnestly recommend to the various
societies here represented, the advisability of becoming affiliated to
that hody, believing that it is essential to the progress and prosperity
of the entire working community."</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">(c) Their future.</span></p>
<p>Apart from their original purposes, they must now learn to act deliberately
as organising centres of the working class in the broad interest of its
<i>complete emancipation.</i> They must aid every social and political
movement tending in that direction. Considering themselves and acting as
the champions and representatives of the whole working class, they cannot
fail to enlist the non-society men into their ranks. They must look carefully
after the interests of the worst paid trades, such as the agricultural
labourers, rendered powerless [French text has: "incapable of organised
resistance"] by exceptional circumstances. They must convince the world
at large [French and German texts read: "convince the broad masses of workers"]
that their efforts, far from being narrow -- and selfish, aim at the emancipation
of the downtrodden millions.</p>
<a id="07"></a>
<h3>7.<br>
Direct and indirect taxation</h3>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">(a)</span> No modification of the form of taxation can produce any
important change in the relations of labour and capital.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">(b)</span> Nevertheless, having to choose between two systems
of taxation, we recommend the <i>total abolition of indirect taxes, </i>and
the <i>general substitution of direct taxes.</i> [In Marx's rough manuscript,
French and German texts are: "because direct taxes are cheaper to collect
and do not interfere with production".]</p>
<p>Because indirect taxes enhance the prices of commodities, the
tradesmen adding to those prices not only the amount of the indirect taxes,
but the interest and profit upon the capital advanced in their payment</p>
<p>Because indirect taxes conceal from an individual what he is paying
to the state, whereas a direct tax is undisguised, unsophisticated, and
not to be misunderstood by the meanest capacity. Direct taxation prompts
therefore every individual to control the governing powers while indirect
taxation destroys all tendency to self-government.</p>
<a id="08"></a>
<h3>8.<br>
International credit</h3>
<p class="fst">Initiative to be left to the French.</p>
<a id="09"></a>
<h3>9.<br>
Polish question</h3>
<p class="fst">[<i>The French subtitle reads: "Necessity of annihilating Russian influence
in Europe by implementing the right of nations to self-determination and
restoring Poland on a democratic and social basis." German subtitle reads
similarly.</i>]</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">(a)</span> Why do the workmen of Europe take up this question?
In the first instance, because the middle-class writers and agitators conspire
to suppress it, although they patronise all sorts of nationalities, on
the Continent, even Ireland. Whence this reticence? Because both, aristocrats
and bourgeois, look upon the dark Asiatic power in the background as a
last resource against the advancing tide of working class ascendancy; That
power can only be effectually put down by the restoration of Poland upon
a democratic basis.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">(b)</span> In the present changed state of central Europe,
and especially Germany, it is more than ever necessary to have a democratic
Poland. Without it, Germany will become the outwork of the Holy Alliance,
with it, the co-operator with republican France. The working-class movement
will continuously be interrupted, checked, and retarded, until this great
European question be set at rest.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">(c)</span> It is especially the duty of the German working
class to take the initiative in this matter, because Germany is one of
the partitioners of Poland.</p>
<a id="10"></a>
<h3>10.<br>
Armies</h3>
<p class="fst">[<i>French and German subtitle reads: "Standing armies; their relation
to production."</i>]</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">(a)</span> The deleterious influence of large standing
armies upon <i>production</i>, has been sufficiently exposed at middle-class
congresses of all denominations, at peace congresses, economical congresses,
statistical congresses, philanthropical congresses, sociological congresses.
We think it, therefore, quite superfluous to expatiate upon this point.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">(b)</span> We propose the general armament of the people
and their general instruction in the use of arms.</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term">(c)</span> We accept as a transitory necessity small standing
armies to form schools for the officers of the militia; every male citizen
to serve for a very limited time in those armies.</p>
<a id="11"></a>
<h3>11.<br>
Religious question</h3>
<p class="fst">[<i>French and German subtitle reads: "Religious ideas; their influence
on the social, political and intellectual movement".</i>]</p>
<p class="fst">To be left to the initiative of the French.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="fst">
<a id="a"></a><span class="term">a</span> <i>Note from International Publishers:</i>
Instead of this sentence the French and German texts have two sentences
ending the preceding paragraph and beginning a new one: "However, for the
present, we have only to deal with the children and young persons belonging
to the working class.</p>

"We deem it necessary, basing on physiology, to divide children
and young persons of both sexes" and then as in the English text.</p>

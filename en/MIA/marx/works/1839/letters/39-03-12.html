<p class="title">Letters of Frederick Engels</p>
<h3>To Marie Engels<br>
In Barmen</h3>
<p>Bremen, March 12, 1839</p>
<p>Dear Marie,</p>
<p>(Continuation of my letter to Hermann.) The <i>Stadtbote </i>is full of absolute nonsense and I am writing poems about it at the office which ridicule it by always praising it to the skies, just incoherent twaddle, and I send it to the paper signed Th. Hildebrandt and they print it in all innocence. I have got one in my desk at this very moment which I am going to send in. It runs like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Book Wisdom</p>
<p class="verse">
He is not wise who from his reading draws<br>
Nothing but floods of useless erudition.<br>
For all his learning, life’s mysterious laws<br>
Are a closed book beyond his comprehension.<br>
He who acquires a thorough textbook grounding<br>
In Botany, won’t hear the grass that grows.<br>
Nor will he ever teach true understanding<br>
Who tells you all the dogma that he knows.<br>
Oh, no! the germ lies hid in man’s own heart.<br>
Who seeks the art of. life must look within.<br>
Burning the midnight oil will not impart<br>
The secret of emotion’s discipline.<br>
The man is lost who hears his own heart’s voice<br>
And spurns it, Wilfully misapprehending.<br>
Of all your words so noble and so wise<br>
The most profound is human understanding.</p>
<p>So it goes, on and on, all mockery. Usually, when I am not quite sure what to send, I get hold of the Bote and scrape something together from that. The other day I sat Karl Leupold at my desk and dictated to him a rude letter to the Bote, <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume02/footnote.html#198" target=_blank>[198]</a></sup> which they received and printed with the most fantastically stupid comments. But I must go out now. So I remain</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Your loving brother</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">Friedrich</p>

<p class="title">The Housing Question by Frederick Engels</p>
<h1>Part two<br>
How the Bourgeoisie Solves the Housing Question</h1>
<p class="fst">In the section on the Proudhonist solution of the
housing question it was shown how greatly the petty bourgeoisie is directly
interested in this question. However, the big bourgeoisie also is very
much interested in it, if indirectly. Modern natural science has proved
that the so-called “poor districts” in which the workers are crowded together
are the breeding places of all those epidemics which from time to time
afflict our towns. Cholera, typhus, typhoid fever, small-pox and other
ravaging diseases spread their germs in the pestilential air and the poisoned
water of these working-class quarters. In these districts, the germs hardly
ever die out completely, and as soon as circumstances permit it they develop
into epidemics and then spread beyond their breeding places also into the
more airy and healthy parts of the town inhabited by the capitalists. Capitalist
rule cannot allow itself the pleasure of creating epidemic diseases among
the working class with impunity; the consequences fall back on it and
the angel of death rages in its ranks as ruthlessly as in the ranks of
the workers.</p>
<p>As soon as this fact had been scientifically established the philanthropic
bourgeois began to compete with one another in noble efforts on behalf
of the health of their workers. Societies were founded, books were written,
proposals drawn up, laws debated and passed, in order to close the sources
of the ever-recurring epidemics. The housing conditions of the workers
were examined and attempts were made to remedy the most crying evils. In
England particularly, where the greatest number of large towns existed
and where the bourgeoisie itself was most immediately threatened, great
activity began. Government commissions were appointed to inquire into the
hygienic conditions of the working classes; their reports, honorably distinguished
from all continental sources by their accuracy, completeness and impartiality,
provided the basis for new, more or less, radically effective, laws. Incomplete
as these laws are, they are still infinitely ahead of everything that has
been done in this direction up to the present on the continent. Nevertheless,
the capitalist order of society reproduces again and again the evils which
are to be remedied with such inevitable necessity that even in England
the remedying of them has hardly advanced a single step.</p>
<p>As usual, Germany needed a much longer time before the chronic
sources of infection existing there also reached the acute degree necessary
to arouse the indolent big bourgeoisie. But he who goes slowly goes surely,
and so among us also there finally arose a bourgeois literature on public
health and the housing question, a watery extract of its foreign, and in
particular its English, predecessors, to which it was sought to give a
deceptive semblance of a higher conception by means of fine-sounding and
solemn phrases. <i>Die Wohnungszustande der arbeitenden Klassen und ihre
Reform</i> [The Housing Conditions of the Working Classes and their Reform]
by Dr. Emil Sax, Vienna, 1869. belongs to this literature.</p>
<p>I have selected this book in order to present the bourgeois treatment
of the housing question only because it makes the attempt to summarize
as far as possible the bourgeois literature on the subject. And a fine
literature it is which serves our author as his “sources!” Of the English
parliamentary reports, the real main sources, only three of the oldest
are mentioned by name; the whole book proves that its author has never
glanced at even a single one of them. On the other hand, a whole series
of banal, bourgeois, well-meaning philistine and hypocritical philanthropic
writings are enumerated: Ducpétiaux, Roberts, Hole, Huber, the proceeding
of the English congresses on social science (or rather social bosh), the
journal of the Association for the Welfare of the Laboring Classes in Prussia,
the official Austrian report on the World Exhibition in Paris, the official
Bonapartist reports on the same subject, the <i>Illustrated London News</i>, <i>Uber
Land und Meer</i> [<i>On Land and Sea</i>] and finally a “recognized authority,” a
man of “acute practical perception,” of “convincing impressiveness of speech,” 
namely – Julius Faucher! All that is missing in this list of sources is
the Gartenlaube, Klepdderadatsch and the Fusilier Kutschke. <span class="context">[Pseudonym
of a German patriotic poet. -Ed.]</span></p>
<p>In order that no misunderstanding may arise concerning the standpoint
of Dr. Sax, he declares on page 22:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “By social economy we mean political economy in its application to
 social questions; or, to put it more precisely, the totality of
 the ways and means which this science offers us for raising the
 so-called (!) propertyless classes to the level of the propertied
 classes, on the basis of its ‘iron’ laws within the framework of
 the order of society at present prevailing.” </p>
<p>
We shall not bother to deal with the confused idea that “economics” or
 “Political economy” deals at all with any other than “social” questions.
Let us get down to the main point immediately. Dr. Sax demands that the
 “iron laws” of bourgeois economics, the “framework of the order of society
at present prevailing,” in other words, that the capitalist mode of production
must continue to exist unchanged, but nevertheless “the so-called propertyless
classes” are to be raised “to the level of the propertied classes.” However,
it is an unavoidable preliminary condition of the capitalist mode of production
that a really, and not a so-called, propertyless class, should exist, a
class which has nothing to sell but its labor power and which is therefore
compelled to sell its labor power to the industrial capitalists. The task
of the new science of social economy invented by Dr. Sax is therefore to
find ways and means, in a state of society founded on the antagonism of
capitalists, owners of all raw materials, instruments of production and
foodstuffs, on the one hand, and of propertyless wage workers, who own
only their labor power and nothing else, on the other hand, by which, inside
this social order, all wage workers can be turned into capitalists without
ceasing to be wage workers. Dr. Sax thinks he has solved this question.
Perhaps he would be so good as to show us how all the soldiers of the French
army, each of whom carries a marshal’s baton in his knapsack since the
days of the old Napoleon, can be turned into field marshals without at
the same time ceasing to be private soldiers? Or how it could be brought
about that all the forty million subjects of the German Empire could be
made into German kaisers.</p>
<p>It is the essence of bourgeois socialism to want to maintain the
basis of all the evils of present-day society and at the same time to want
to abolish the evils themselves. As already pointed out in The Communist
Manifesto, the bourgeois socialist “is desirous of redressing social grievances
in order to secure the continued existence of bourgeois society,” he wants
 “a bourgeoisie without a proletariat.” We have already seen that Dr. Sax
formulates the question in exactly the same fashion. The solution he finds
in the solution of the housing question. He is of the opinion that:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “by improving the housing of the working classes it would be
 possible successfully to remedy the material and spiritual misery
 which has been described, and thereby – by a radical improvement
 of the housing conditions alone – to raise the greater part of
 these classes out of the morass of their often hardly human
 conditions of existence to the pure heights of material and
 spiritual well-being.” (Page 14.)</p>
<p>
Incidentally, it is in the interests of the bourgeoisie to disguise the
fact of the existence of a proletariat created by the bourgeois production
relations and determining the continued existence of these production relations.
And, therefore, Dr. Sax tells us (page 21) that the expression working
classes is to be understood as including all “impecunious social classes,” 
 “and in general, people in a small way, such as handicraftsman, widows,
pensioners (!), subordinate officials, etc.,” as well as actual workers.
Bourgeois socialism extends its band to the petty-bourgeois variety.</p>
<p>Whence then comes the housing shortage? How did it arise? As a
good bourgeois, Dr. Sax is not supposed to know that it is a necessary
product of the bourgeois social order; that it cannot fail to be present
in a society in which the great masses of the workers are exclusively dependent
upon wages, that is to say, on the sum of foodstuffs necessary for their
existence and for the propagation of their kind; in which improvements
of the existing machinery continually throw masses of workers out of employment;
in which violent and regularly recurring industrial vacillations determine
on the one hand the existence of a large reserve army of unemployed workers,
and on the other hand drive large masses of the workers temporarily unemployed
onto the streets; in which the workers are crowded together in masses in
the big towns, at a quicker rate than dwellings come into existence for
them under existing conditions; in which, therefore, there must always
be tenants even for the most infamous pigsties; and in which finally the
house owner in his capacity as capitalist has not only the right, but,
in view of the competition, to a certain extent also the duty of ruthlessly
making as much out of his property in house rent as he possibly can. In
such a society the housing shortage is no accident; it is a necessary institution
and it can be abolished together with all its effects on health, etc.,
only if the whole social order from which it springs is fundamentally refashioned.
That, however, bourgeois socialism dare not know. It dare not explain the
housing shortage from the existing conditions. And therefore nothing remains
for it but to explain the housing shortage by means of moral phrases as
the result of the baseness of human beings, as the result of original sin,
so to speak.</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “And here we cannot fail to recognize – and in consequence we
 cannot deny” (daring conclusion!) – that the responsibility rests
 partly with the workers themselves, those who want dwellings, and
 partly, the much greater part it is true, with those who undertake
 to supply the need, or those who, although they have sufficient
 means, make no attempt to supply the need, viz., the propertied,
 higher social classes. The responsibility of these last consists
 in the fact that they do not make it their business to provide for
 a sufficient supply of good dwellings.” </p>
<p>
Just as Proudhon takes us from the sphere of economics into the sphere
of legal phrases so our bourgeois socialist takes us from the economic
sphere into the moral sphere. And nothing is more natural. Whoever declares
that the capitalist mode of production, the “iron laws” of present-day
bourgeois society, are inviolable, and yet at the same time would like
to abolish their unpleasant but necessary consequences, has no other resource
but to deliver moral sermons to the capitalists, moral sermons whose emotional
effects immediately evaporate under the influence of private interests
and, if necessary, of competition. These moral sermons are in effect exactly
the same as those of the hen at the edge of the pond in which she sees
the family of ducklings she has hatched out gaily swimming. Ducklings take
to the water although it is not dry land, and capitalists grab after profit
although it is heartless. “There is no room for sentiment in money matters,” 
was said already by old Hansemann, who knew more about it than Dr. Sax.
<span class="context">[Hansemann, David Justus (1790-1864), Prussian financier and leader of the Rhenish “progressive” bourgeoisie, was Finance Minister of Prussia from March to September 1848, and later head of the Bank of Prussia. He founded
the Diskonto-Gesellschaft. – Ed.]</span></p>
<p class="quoteb"> “Good dwellings are so expensive that it is absolutely impossible
 for the greater part of the workers to use them. Big capital...
 is shy of investing in houses for the working classes – and as a
 result these classes and their housing needs fall for the greater
 part into the hands of speculators.” </p>
<p>
Disgusting speculation – big capital naturally never speculates! But it
is not ill will, it is only ignorance which prevents big capital from speculating
in workers’ houses:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “House owners do not know what a great and important role is
 played by a normal satisfaction of housing needs; they do not know
 what they are doing to the people when they give them, as a
 general rule, such irresponsibly bad and deleterious dwellings,
 and, finally, they do not know how they damage themselves
 thereby.” (Page 27.)</p>
<p>
However, the ignorance of the capitalists must be supplemented by the ignorance
of the workers in order that the housing shortage may be created. After
Dr. Sax has admitted that:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “The very lowest sections” of the workers “are obliged (!) to seek
 a night’s lodging wherever and however they can find it in order
 not to remain altogether without shelter and in this connection
 they are absolutely defenseless and helpless,” he tells us, “for
 it is a well-known fact how many among them (the workers) from
 carelessness, but chiefly from ignorance, deprive their bodies.
 One is almost inclined to say, with virtuosity, of the conditions
 of natural development and healthy existence, in that they have
 riot the faintest idea of rational hygiene and, in particular, of
 the enormous importance played by the dwelling in this hygiene.”  
 (Page 27.)</p>
<p>
Here, however, the bourgeois donkey’s ears protrude. Whereas, so far as
the capitalists are concerned, their “guilt” disappears in ignorance, where
the workers are concerned ignorance is only the cause of their guilt. Listen:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “Thus it comes (namely through ignorance) that if they can only
 save something on the rent they will move into dark, damp and
 inadequate dwellings, which are in short a mockery of all the
 demands of hygiene... that often several families together rent a
 single dwelling, indeed even a single room – all this in order to
 spend as little as possible for rent, while on the other hand they
 squander their income in a really sinful fashion on drink and all
 sorts of idle pleasures.” </p>
<p>
The money which the workers “waste on spirits and tobacco” (page 28), the
 “public-house life with all its regrettable consequences which drags the
workers again and again like a lead weight back into the mire” lies indeed
like a lead weight in Dr. Sax’s stomach. The fact that under existing circumstances
drunkenness among the workers is an inevitable product of their living
conditions, just as inevitable as typhus, crime, vermin, the bailiff and
other social ills, so inevitable in fact that the average figures of those
who succumb to chronic drunkenness can be calculated in advance, is again
something that Dr. Sax cannot allow himself to know. My old elementary
teacher used to say, by the way: “The common people go to the public houses
and the people of quality go to the clubs,” and as I have been in both
I am in a position to confirm it.</p>
<p>The whole talk about the “ignorance” of both parties amounts to
nothing but the old phrases about the harmony of interests of labor and
capital. If the capitalists knew their true interests, then they would
give the workers good houses and put them in a better position in general,
and if the workers understood their true interests they would not go on
strike, they would not go in for Social Democracy, they would not take
part in politics, but docilely follow their superiors, the capitalists.
Unfortunately, both sides find their real interests altogether elsewhere
than in the sermons of Dr. Sax and his numerous predecessors. The gospel
of harmony between labor and capital has been preached now for almost fifty
years, and bourgeois philanthropy has expended large sums of money to prove
this harmony of interests by building model institutions, and, as we shall
see later, we are today exactly where we were fifty years ago.</p>
<p>Our author now proceeds to the practical solution of the. question.
How little revolutionary Proudhon’s proposal to make the workers into the
owners of their dwellings was, can be seen from the fact that bourgeois
socialism even before him, tried to carry it out in practice and is still
trying to do so. Dr. Sax also declares that the housing question can be
completely solved only by transferring property in dwellings to the hands
of the workers. (Pages 58 and 59.) More than that. he falls into poetic
raptures at the idea and breaks out with the following flight of enthusiasm:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “There is something peculiar about the longing in mankind to own
 land; it is an urge which not even the feverishly pulsating
 business life of the present day has been able to weaken. It is
 the unconscious appreciation of the significance of the economic
 achievement represented by landownership. With it the individual
 obtains a secure hold; he is rooted firmly in the earth, and every
 economy (!) has its most permanent basis in it. However, the
 blessings of landownership extend far beyond these material
 advantages. Whoever is fortunate enough to call a piece of land
 his own has reached the highest conceivable stage of economic
 independence; he has a terrain on which he can rule with sovereign
 power; he is his own master; he has a certain power and a secure
 guarantee in time of need; his self-confidence develops and with
 this his moral power. And from this comes the deep significance
 of property in the question before us.... The worker, today
 helplessly exposed to all the changing circumstances of economic
 life, and in constant dependence on his employer, would thereby be
 rescued to a certain extent from this precarious situation; he
 would become a capitalist and be safeguarded against the dangers
 of unemployment or incapacity to work, as a result of the real
 estate credit which would thereby be open to him. He would
 thereby be raised out of the ranks of the propertyless into the
 class of the property owners.” (Page 63.)</p>
<p>
Dr. Sax seems to assume that man is essentially a peasant, otherwise he
would not ascribe to the workers of our big cities a longing for property
in land, a longing which no one else has discovered. For our workers in
the big cities freedom of movement is the first condition of their existence,
and landownership could only be a hindrance to them. Give them their own
houses, chain them once again to the soil and you break their power of
resistance to the wage cutting of the factory owners. The individual worker
might be able to sell his house on occasion, but during a big strike or
a general industrial crisis all the houses belonging to the affected workers
would have to come onto the market for sale and would therefore find no
purchasers or be sold off far below their cost price. And even if they
all found purchasers, the whole great solution of the housing question
of Dr. Sax would have come to nothing and he would have to start from the
beginning again. However, poets live in a world of fantasy, and so does
Dr. Sax, who imagines that a landowner has “reached the highest... stage
of economic independence,” that he has “a secure hold,” that he has “become
a capitalist and... safeguarded against the dangers of unemployment or
incapacity to work, as a result of the real estate credit which would thereby
be open to him,” etc. Dr. Sax should take a look at the French peasants
and at our own small peasants in the Rhineland; their houses and fields
are loaded down with mortgages, their harvests belong to their creditors
before they are brought in, and it is not they who rule with sovereign
power on their “terrain” but the usurer, the lawyer and the bailiff. That
certainly represents the highest conceivable stage of economic independence
– for the usurer! And in order that the workers may bring their little
houses as quickly as possible under the same sovereignty of the usurer,
our well-meaning Dr. Sax carefully points to the real estate credit which
they can make use of in times of unemployment or incapacity to work instead
of becoming a burden on the poor rate.</p>
<p>In any case, Dr. Sax has solved the question raised in the beginning:
the worker “becomes a capitalist” by acquiring his own little house.</p>
<p>Capital is the command over the unpaid labor of others. The house
of the worker can only become capital therefore if he rents it to a third
person and appropriates a part of the labor product of this third person
in the form of rent. By the fact that the worker lives in it himself the
house is prevented from becoming capital, just as a coat ceases to be capital
the moment I buy it from the tailor and put it on. The worker who owns
a little house to the value of a thousand talers is certainly no longer
a proletarian, but one must be Dr. Sax to call him a capitalist.</p>
<p>However, the capitalist character of our worker has still another
side. Let us assume that in a given industrial area it has become the
rule that each worker owns his own little house. In this case the working
class of that area lives rent free; expenses for rent no longer enter into
the value of its labor power. Every reduction in the cost of production
of labor power, that is to say, every permanent price reduction in the
worker’s necessities of life is equivalent “on the basis of the iron laws
of political economy” to a reduction in the value of labor power and will
therefore finally result in a corresponding fall in wages. Wages would
fall on an average corresponding to the average sum saved on rent, that
is, the worker would pay rent for his own house, but not, as formerly,
in money to the house owner, but in unpaid labor to the factory owner for
whom he works. In this way the savings of the worker invested in his little
house would certainly become capital to some extent, but not capital for
him, but for the capitalist employing him.</p>
<p>Dr. Sax is thus unable to succeed even on paper in turning his
worker into a capitalist.</p>
<p>Incidentally, what has been said above applies to all so-called
social reforms which aim at saving or cheapening the means of subsistence
of the worker. Either they become general and then they are followed by
a corresponding reduction of wages, or they remain quite isolated experiments,
and- then their very existence as isolated exceptions proves that their
realization on a general scale is incompatible with the existing capitalist
mode of production. Let us assume that in a certain area a general introduction
of consumers’ co-operatives succeeds in reducing the cost of foodstuffs
for the workers by 20 per cent; in the long run wages would fall in that
area by approximately 20 per cent, that is to say, in the same proportion
as the foodstuffs in question enter into the means of subsistence of the
workers. If the worker, for example, spends three-quarters of his weekly
wage on these foodstuffs, then wages would finally fall by three-quarters
of 20 = 15 per cent. In short, as soon as any such savings reform has become
general, the worker receives in the same proportion less wages, as his
savings permit him to live cheaper. Give every worker a saved, independent
income of 52 talers a year and his weekly wage must finally fall by one
taler. Therefore: the more he saves the less he will receive in wages.
He saves therefore not in his own interests, but in the interests of the
capitalist. Is anything else necessary in order “to stimulate in the most
powerful fashion the primary economic virtue, thrift?” (Page 64.)</p>
<p>For the rest, Herr Sax tells us immediately afterwards that the
workers are to become house owners not so much in their own interests as
in the interests of the capitalists:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “However. not only the working class. but society as a whole has
 the greatest interest in seeing as many of its members as possible
 bound (!) to the land” (I should like to see Dr. Sax himself in
 this position.) “.... All the secret forces which set on fire the
 volcano called the social question which glows under our feet, the
 proletarian bitterness, the hatred... the dangerous confusion of
 ideas... must disappear like mist before the morning sun when...
 the workers themselves enter in this fashion into the ranks of the
 property owners.” (Page 65.)</p>
<p>
In other words, Herr Sax hopes that by an alteration of their proletarian
status such as would be brought about by the acquisition of house property,
the workers would also lose their proletarian character and become once
again obedient toadies like their forefathers who were also house owners.
The Proudhonists should take that to heart.</p>
<p>Herr Sax believes he has thereby solved the social problem:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “A juster distribution of goods, the riddle of the Sphinx which so
 many have already tried in vain to solve, does it not now lie
 before us as a tangible fact, has it not thereby been taken from
 the region of ideals and brought into the realm of reality? And
 if it is carried out is not thereby one of the highest aims
 achieved, one which even the socialists of the extremist tendency
 present as the culminating point of their theories?” (Page 66.)</p>
<p>
It is really lucky that we have worked our way through as far as this,
because this shout of triumph is the culminating point of Herr Sax’s book,
and after that it gently descends from “the region of ideals” into insipid
reality, and when we have descended we shall find that nothing, nothing
at all, has changed in our absence.</p>
<p>Our leader causes us to take the first step downwards by informing
us that there are two systems of workers’ dwellings: the cottage system
in which each working-class family has its own little house and if possible
a little garden as well, as in England; and the barrack system of large
buildings containing numerous workers’ dwellings, as in Paris, Vienna,
etc. Between the two is the system usual in Northern Germany. Now it is
true that the cottage system is said to be the only correct one, and the
only one whereby the worker could acquire the ownership of his own house,
while further the barrack system has very great disadvantages with regard
to hygiene, morality and domestic peace – but unfortunately the cottage
system is not realizable just in the centres of the housing shortage, in
the big cities, on account of the high price of land, and one should therefore
be glad if houses were built containing from four to six dwellings instead
of big barracks, or at least the disadvantages of the big tenement system
made up for by various building refinements. (Pages 71-92.)</p>
<p>We have descended quite a long way already, have we not? The transformation
of the workers into capitalists, the solution of the social question, a
house of his own for each worker, all these things have been left behind,
up above in “the region of ideals.” All that remains for us to do is to
introduce the cottage system into the country areas and to make the workers’
barracks in the towns as tolerable as possible.</p>
<p>On its own admission, therefore, the bourgeois solution of the
housing question has come to grief-it has come to grief owing to the antithesis
of town and country. And with this we have arrived at the kernel of the
problem. The housing question can only be solved when society has been
sufficiently transformed for a start to be made towards abolishing the
antithesis between town and country, which has been brought to an extreme
point by present-day capitalist society. Far from being able to abolish
this antithesis, capitalist society on the contrary is compelled to intensify
it day by day. On the other hand the first modern utopian socialists, Owen
and Fourier, already correctly recognized this. In their model plans the
antithesis between town and country no longer exists. Consequently there
takes place exactly the contrary of that which Herr Sax contends; it is
not the solution of the housing question which simultaneously solves the
social question, but only by the solution of the social question, that
is, by the abolition of the capitalist mode of production, is the solution
of the housing question made possible. To want to solve the housing question
while at the same time desiring to maintain the modern big cities is an
absurdity. The modern big cities, however, will be abolished only by the
abolition of the capitalist mode of production, and when this is once on
the way then there will be quite other thing to do than supplying each
worker with a little house for his own possession.</p>
<p>In the beginning, however, each social revolution will have to
take things as it finds them and do its best to get rid of the most crying
evils with the means at its disposal. And we have already seen that the
housing shortage can be remedied immediately by expropriating a part of
the luxury dwellings belonging to the propertied classes and by quartering
workers in the remaining part.</p>
<p>Continuing, Herr Sax once more leaves the big cities and delivers
a lengthy verbose discourse upon working class colonies to be established
near the towns; he describes all the beauties of such colonies with their
joint “water supply, gas lighting, air or hot water heating, wash houses,
drying rooms, bathrooms, etc.,” with their “creche, school, prayer hall
(!), reading room, library ... wine and beer hall, dancing and concert
hall in all respectability,” with steam power laid on to all the houses
so that “to a certain extent production can be relayed from the factory
into domestic workshops”; but this does not alter the situation at all.
The colony Herr Sax describes has been directly borrowed by Mr. Huber from
the socialists Owen and Fourier and merely made entirely bourgeois by discarding
everything socialist about them. Thereby, however, it becomes really utopian.
No capitalist has any interest in establishing such colonies, and in fact
none such exists anywhere in the world, except in Guise in France and that
was built by a follower of Fourier, not as profitable speculation but as
a socialist experiment. [And this one also has finally become a mere centre
of working class exploitation. (See the Paris Socialiste of 1886.) – Note
by F. Engels to the second German edition.] Herr Sax might just as well
have quoted in support of big bourgeois project-spinning the example of
the communist colony “Harmony Hall” founded by Owen in Hampshire at the
beginning of the ’forties and long since defunct.</p>
<p>In any case, all this talk about colonization is nothing more
than a lame attempt to soar again into “the region of ideals” and it is
immediately afterwards again abandoned. We descend rapidly again. The simplest
solution then is:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “that the employers, the factory owners, should assist the workers
 to obtain suitable dwellings, whether they do so by building such
 themselves or by encouraging and assisting the workers to do their
 own building and by providing them with land, advancing them
 building capital, etc.” (Page 106.)</p>
<p>
With this we are once again out of the big towns where there can be no
question of anything of the sort and back in the country. Herr Sax then
proves that here it is in the interests of the factory owners themselves
that they should assist their workers to obtain tolerable dwellings, on
the one hand because it is a good investment, and on the other hand because
the inevitable:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “resulting uplift of the workers ... must result in an increase of
 their mental and physical working capacity, which naturally – no
 less – is of advantage to the employers. With this, however, the
 right point of view for the participation of the latter in the
 solution of the housing question is given; it appears as the
 outcome of a latent association, as the outcome of the care of the
 employers for the physical and economic, mental and moral
 well-being of their workers, which is concealed for the most part
 under the cloak of humanitarian efforts and which is its own
 pecuniary reward because of its results in producing and
 maintaining a diligent, skilled, willing, contented and devoted
 working class.” (Page 108.)</p>
<p>
The phrase “latent association,” with which Huber attempts to impose on
this bourgeois philanthropic drivel “a higher significance,” does not alter
the situation at all. Even without this phrase the big rural factory owners,
particularly in England, have long ago recognized that the building of
workers’ dwellings is not only a necessity, a part of the factory equipment
itself, but also that it pays very well. In England whole villages have
grown up in this way, and some of them have later developed into towns.
The workers, however, instead of being thankful to the philanthropic capitalists,
have always raised very considerable objections to this “cottage system.” 
Not only are they compelled to pay monopoly prices for these houses because
the factory owner has no competitors, but immediately a strike breaks out
they are homeless, because the factory owner throws them out of his houses
without any more ado and thus renders any resistance difficult.</p>
<p>Further details can be studied in my Condition of the Working
Class in England, pp. 184 and 256. Herr Sax, however, thinks that these
objections “hardly deserve refutation.” (Page 111.) But does he not want
to make the worker the owner of his dwelling? Certainly, but, as “the employers
must always be in a position to dispose of the dwelling in order that when
they dismiss a worker to have room for the one who replaces him,” well
then, there is nothing for it but “to make some provision for such cases
by agreement for the revocation of ownership.” (Page 113.)</p>
<p>[In this respect also. the English capitalists have long ago not
only fulfilled but far exceeded all the cherished wishes of Herr Sax. On
Monday, October 14, 1872, the court in Morpeth had to adjudicate on an
application on behalf of 2,000 miners to have their names enrolled on the
list of parliamentary voters. It transpired that the greater number of
these miners, according to the regulations of the mine at which they were
employed, were not to be regarded as tenants of the dwellings in which
they lived, but, as occupying these dwellings on sufferance, and they could
be thrown out of them at any moment without notice. (The landowner and
house owner were naturally one and the same per-on.) The judge decided
that these men were not tenants but servants, and therefore as such not
entitled to be included in the list of voters. (<i>Daily News</i>, October 15,
1872.) – Note by F. Engels.]</p>

<h3><a id="s2">II</a></h3>
<p>This time we have come down with unexpected suddenness. First it was
said the worker must own his own little house. Then we are informed that
this is impossible in the towns and can be carried out only in-the country.
And now we are told that ownership even in the country is to be “revocable
by agreement!” With this new sort of property for the workers discovered
by Herr Sax, with this transformation of the workers into capitalists “revocable
by agreement,” we have safely arrived again on firm ground, and have here
to examine what the capitalists and other philanthropists have actually
done to solve the housing question.</p>
<p>If we are to believe our worthy Dr. Sax, much has already been
done by Messieurs the capitalists to remedy the housing shortage; and the
proof has been provided that the housing question can be solved on the
basis of the capitalist mode of production.</p>
<p>Above all, Herr Sax quotes us the example of – Bonapartist France!
As is known, Louis Bonaparte appointed a commission at the time of the
Paris World Exhibition ostensibly to report upon the situation of the working
classes in France, but in reality to describe their situation as blissful
in the extreme, to the greater glory of the Empire. And it is to this report,
drawn up by a commission composed of the corruptest tools of Bonapartism,
that Herr Sax refers, particularly because the results of its work are
 “according to the committee’s own statement fairly complete for France.” 
And what are these results? Of eighty-nine big industrialists or joint-stock
companies which gave information to the commission, thirty-one had built
no workers’ dwellings at all. According to the estimate of Dr. Sax himself,
the dwellings that were built house at the most from 50,000 to 60,000 people,
and the dwellings themselves consist almost exclusively of no more than
two rooms for each family.</p>
<p>It is obvious that every capitalist who is tied down to a particular
rural district by the conditions of his industry – water power, the position
of coal mines, iron-stone deposits and other mines, etc. – must build
dwellings for his workers if none are available. To see in this a proof
of “latent association,” “an eloquent testimony to a growing understanding
of the question and its wide import,” a “very promising beginning” (page
115), all this demands a very highly developed habit of self-deception.
For the rest, the industrialists of the various countries differ from each
other in this respect also according to national character. For instance,
Herr Sax informs us (page 117):</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “In England only recently has increased activity on the part of
 employers in this direction been observable. This refers in
 particular to the more out of the way hamlets in the rural
 areas.... The circumstance that otherwise the workers often have
 to walk a long way from the nearest village to the factory and
 arrive there so exhausted that they do not perform enough work is
 the chief reason which furnishes the employers with the motive for
 building dwellings for their workers. However, the number of
 those who have a deeper understanding of conditions and who
 combine with the cause of housing reform more or less all the
 other elements of latent association is also increasing, and it is
 these people to whom credit is due for the establishment of those
 flourishing colonies.... The names of Ashton in Tiyde, Ashworth in
 Tuxton, Grant in Bury, Greg in Bollington, Marshall in Leeds,
 Stratt in Belper, Salt in Saltaire, Ackroid in Copley, and others
 are known on this account throughout the United Kingdom.” </p>
<p>
Blessed simplicity and still more blessed ignorance! The English rural
factory owners have “only recently” begun to build workers’ dwellings!
No, my dear Herr Sax, the English capitalists are really big industrialists,
not only as regards their purses, but also as regards their brains. Long
before Germany possessed a really large-scale industry, they had realized
that for factory production in the rural districts expenditure on workers’
dwellings was a necessary part of the total investment of capital and a
very profitable one, both directly and indirectly. Long before the struggle
between Bismarck and the German bourgeoisie had given the German workers
freedom of association, the English factory, mine and foundry owners had
had practical experience of the pressure they could exert on striking workers
if they were at the same time the landlords of those workers. The “flourishing
colonies” of Greg, Ashton and Ashworth are so “recent” that even forty
years ago they were hailed by the bourgeoisie as model examples, as I myself
described twenty-eight years ago. (The Condition of the Working Class in
England, Note on page 186.) The colonies of Marshall and Akroyd (that is
how the man spells his name) are about as old, and the colony of Strutt
is much older, its beginnings reaching back into the last century. Since
in England the average duration of a worker’s dwelling is reckoned as forty
years, Herr Sax can calculate on his fingers the dilapidated condition
in which these “flourishing colonies” are today. In addition, the majority
of these colonies are now no longer in the countryside. The colossal expansion
of industry has surrounded most of them with factories and houses to such
an extent that they are now situated in the middle of dirty, smoky towns
with 20,000, 30,000, and more inhabitants. But all this does not prevent
German bourgeois science, as represented by Herr Sax, from devoutly repeating
today the old English paeans of praise of 1840, which no longer have any
application.</p>
<p>And to give us old Akroyd as an example! This worthy was certainly
a philanthropist of the first water. He loved his workers, and in particular
his female employees, to such an extent that his less philanthropic competitors
in Yorkshire used to say of him that he ran his factories exclusively with
his own children! It is true that Dr. Sax contends that “illegitimate children
are becoming more and more rare” in these flourishing colonies. (Page 118.)
Yes, that is true so far as it refers to illegitimate children born out
of wedlock, for in the English industrial districts the pretty girls marry
very young.</p>
<p>In England the establishment of workers’ dwellings close to each
big rural factory and simultaneously with the factory has been the rule
for sixty years and more. As already mentioned, many of these factory villages
have become the nucleus around which later on a whole factory town has
grown up with all the evils which a factory town brings with it. These
colonies have therefore not solved the housing question, on the contrary,
they first really created it in their localities. On the other hand, in
countries which in the sphere of large-scale industry have only limped
along behind England, and which have really only got to know what large-scale
industry is after 1848, in France and particularly in Germany, the situation
is quite different. Here, it is only colossal foundries and factories which
decided after much hesitation to build a certain number of workers’ dwellings
– for instance, the Schneider works in Creusot and the Krupp works in
Essen. The great majority of the rural industrialists let their workers
trudge miles through the heat, snow and rain every morning to the factories,
and back again every evening to their homes. This is particularly the case
in mountainous districts, in the French and Alsatian Vosges districts,
in the valleys of the Wupper, Sieg, Agger, Lenne and other Rhineland-Westphalian
rivers. In the Erzgebirge the situation is probably no better. The same
petty niggardliness occurs both among the Germans and among the French.</p>
<p>Herr Sax knows very well that both the very promising beginning
and the flourishing colonies mean less than nothing. Therefore, he tries
now to prove to the capitalists what magnificent rents they can obtain
by building workers dwellings. In other words, he seeks to show them a
new way of cheating the workers.</p>
<p>First of all, he holds up to them the example of a number of London
building societies; partly philanthropic and partly speculative, which
have shown a net profit of from four to six per cent and more. It is not
necessary for Herr Sax to prove to us that capital invested in workers’
houses yields a good profit. The reason why the capitalists do not invest
still more than they do in workers’ dwellings is that more expensive dwellings
bring in still greater profits for their owners. The exhortation of Herr
Sax to the capitalists, therefore, amounts, once again, to nothing but
a moral sermon.</p>
<p>As far as these London building societies are concerned, whose
brilliant successes Herr Sax so loudly proclaims, they have according to
his own figures – and every sort of building speculation is included –
provided dwellings for a total of 2,132 families and 706 single men, i.e.,
for less than 15,000 persons! And is it presumed seriously to present in
Germany this sort of childishness as a great success, although in the East
End of London alone half a million workers live under the most miserable
housing conditions? The whole of these philanthropic efforts are in fact
so miserably futile that the English parliamentary reports dealing, with
the situation of the workers never even bother to mention them.</p>
<p>We will not even speak here of the ludicrous ignorance of London
which shows itself throughout this whole section. Just one point, however:
Herr Sax is of the opinion that the Lodging House for Single Men in Soho
went out of business because there was no hope of obtaining a large
clientele” in this neighborhood. Herr Sax imagines that the whole of the
West End of London is one big luxury town, and does not know that right
behind the most elegant streets the dirtiest workers’ quarters are to be
found, of which, for example, Soho is one. The model lodging house in Soho
which he mentions and which I knew twenty-three years ago, was well enough
frequented in the beginning, but closed down finally because no one could
stand it, and yet it was one of the best.</p>
<p>But the workers’ town of Millhausen in Alsace – that is surely
a success?</p>
<p>The workers’ town of Millhausen is the great show-piece of the
continental bourgeois, just as the one-time flourishing colonies of Ashton,
Ashworth, Greg and Co., are of the English bourgeois. Unfortunately, the
Millhausen example is not any product of “latent association,” but of the
open association between the Second French Empire and the capitalists of
Alsace. It was one of Louis Bonaparte’s socialist experiments, for which
the state advanced one-third of the capital. In fourteen years (up to 1867)
it built 800 small houses according to a very defective system, an impossible
one in England where they understand these things better, and these houses
are handed over to the workers to become their own property after thirteen
to fifteen years of monthly payments at an increased rental.</p>
<p>It was not necessary for the Bonapartists of Alsace to invent
this way of acquiring property; as we shall see, it had been introduced
by the English co-operative building societies long before. Compared with
English conditions, the extra rent paid for the purchase of these houses
is rather high. For instance, after having paid 4,500 francs by installments
in fifteen years, the worker receives a house which was worth 3,300 francs
fifteen years before. If the worker wants to go away or if he is in arrears
with only a single monthly installment (in which case he can be turned
on to the streets), six and two-thirds per cent of the original value of
the house is reckoned as the annual rent (for instance, 17 francs a month
for a house worth 3,000 francs) and the rest is paid out to him, but without
a penny of interest. It is quite clear that under such circumstances the
society is able to grow fat, quite apart from “state assistance.” It is
just as clear that the houses provided under these circumstances are better
than the old tenement houses in the town itself, if only because they are
built outside the town in a semi-rural neighborhood.</p>
<p>We need not say a word about the few miserable experiments which
have been made in Germany; even Herr Sax, page 157, recognizes their woefulness.</p>
<p>What then exactly do all these examples prove? Simply that the
building of workers’ dwellings is profitable from the capitalist point
of view, even when all the laws of hygiene are not trodden under foot.
But that has never been denied; we all knew that long ago. Any investment
of capital which satisfies an existing need is profitable if conducted
rationally. The question, however, is precisely, why the housing shortage
continues to exist all the same, why the capitalists all the same do not
provide sufficient healthy dwellings for the workers. And here Herr Sax
has again nothing but exhortations to make to the capitalists and fails
to provide us with an answer. The real answer to this question we have
already given above.</p>
<p>Capital does not desire to abolish the housing shortage even if
it could; this has now been completely established. There remain, therefore,
only two other expedients, self-help on the part of the workers and state
assistance.</p>
<p>Herr Sax, an enthusiastic worshipper of self-help, is able to
report wonderful things about it also in regard to the housing question.
Unfortunately he is compelled to admit right at the beginning that self-help
can only effect anything where the cottage system either already exists
or where it can be introduced, i.e., once again only in the rural areas.
In the big cities, even in England, it can be effective only in a very
limited measure. Herr Sax then sighs: “Reform in this way (by self-help)
can be effected only in a roundabout way and must therefore always be imperfect,
namely in so far as the principle of ownership reacts on the quality of
the dwelling.” It would be permissible to doubt even this, in any case,
the “principle of ownership” has not exercised any reforming influence
on the “quality” of the author’s style. Despite all this, self-help in
England has achieved such wonders “that thereby everything done there to
solve the housing question from other angles has been far exceeded.” Herr
Sax is referring to the English “building societies” and he deals with
them at great length because:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “very inadequate or erroneous ideas are current about their
 general character and activities. The English building societies
 are by no means associations for building houses or building
 co-operatives; they can be described in German rather as
 ‘Hauswerbvereine’ [associations for the acquisition of housing
 property]. They are associations which aim at accumulating funds
 from the periodical contributions of their members in order then,
 out of these funds and according to their size, to grant loans to
 their members for the purchase of a house.... The building society
 is thus a savings bank for one section of its members, and for the
 other section a loan bank. The building societies are therefore
 mortgage credit institutions calculated for the requirements of
 the workers which, in the main, use the savings of the workers to
 assist persons of the same social standing as the depositors to
 purchase or build a house. As may be supposed, such loans are
 granted by mortgaging the real property in question, and the
 conditions are such that they must be paid back in short
 installments which combine both interest and amortization. The
 interest is not paid out to the depositors, but always placed to
 their credit at compound interest. The members can demand the
 return of the sums they have paid in, plus interest, at any time,
 by giving a month’s notice.” (Pages 170 to 172.) “There are over
 2,000 such associations in England and their total capital amounts
 to about L15,000,000 sterling. In this way about 100,000 working
 class families have obtained possession of their own hearth and
 home; a social achievement the like of which will certainly not be
 quickly found.” (Page 174.)</p>
<p>
Unfortunately here too the “but” comes limping along immediately after:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “However, a perfect solution of the question has by no means been
 achieved in this way; for the reason, if for no other, that the
 acquisition of a house is open only to the better situated
 workers. In particular, sanitary considerations are not always
 sufficiently taken into consideration.” (Page 176.)</p>
<p>
On the continent, “such associations find only little scope for development.” 
They presuppose the existence of the cottage system which exists only in
the countryside on the continent, and in the countryside the workers are
not sufficiently developed for self-help. On the other hand, in the towns
where real building societies could be formed, they are faced with “very
considerable and serious difficulties of all sorts.” (Page 179.) They could
build only cottages and that is no good in the big cities. In short, “this
form of co-operative self-help” can “in the present circumstances – and hardly
in the near future – not play the chief role in the solution of the question
before us.” These building societies are, we are told, still “in their
first undeveloped beginnings” and “this is true even of England.” (Page
181.)</p>
<p>Hence, the capitalists will not and the workers cannot. And with
this we could close this section if it were not absolutely necessary to
provide a little information about the English building societies, which
the bourgeoisie of the Schulze-Delitzsch type always hold up to our workers
as models.</p>
<p>These building societies are not workers’ societies, nor is it
their main aim to provide workers with their own houses. On the contrary,
we shall see that this happens only very exceptionally. The building societies
are essentially of a speculative nature, the smaller ones., which were
the original societies, not less so than their bigger imitators. In a public
house, usually at the instigation of the proprietor, in whose rooms the
weekly meetings then take place, a number of regular customers and their
friends, small shopkeepers, clerks, commercial travelers, master artisans
and other petty bourgeois – with here and there perhaps an engineer or
some other worker belonging to the aristocracy of his class found a building
society. The immediate occasion is usually that the proprietor has discovered
a comparatively cheap plot of land in the neighborhood or somewhere else.
Most of the members are not bound by their occupations to any particular
district. Even many of the small shopkeepers and artisans have only business
premises in the town and not any dwelling; whoever is in a position to
do so prefers to live in the suburbs rather than in the centre of the smoky
town. The building plot is purchased and as many cottages as possible erected
on it. The credit of the better off members makes the purchase possible,
and the weekly contributions together with a few small loans cover the
weekly costs of building. Those members who aim at getting a house of their
own receive cottages by lot as they are completed, and the appropriate
extra rent serves for the amortization of the purchase price. The remaining
cottages are then either let or sold. The building society, however, assuming
that it does good business, accumulates a larger or smaller sum which remains
the property of the members, providing that they keep up their contributions,
and which from time to time, or when the society is dissolved, is distributed
among them. This is the life history of nine out of ten of the English
building societies. The others are bigger societies, sometimes formed under
political or philanthropic pretexts, but their chief aim is always to provide
the savings of the petty bourgeoisie with a more profitable mortgage investment
at a good rate of interest, with the prospect of dividends as a result
of speculation in real estate.</p>
<p>The sort of clients these societies speculate on can be seen from
the prospectus of one of the largest if not the largest of them. The Birkbeck
Building Society, 29 and 30, Southampton Buildings, Chancery Lane, London,
whose gross receipts since its existence total £10,500,000 sterling, which
has over £416,000 in the bank or invested in state securities, and which
at present has 21,441 members and depositors, introduces itself to the
public in the following fashion:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “Most people are acquainted with the so-called three-year system
 of the piano manufacturers according to which anyone hiring a
 piano for three years becomes the owner of the piano after the
 expiration of that period. Prior to the introduction of this
 system it was almost as difficult for people of limited income to
 acquire a good piano as it was for them to acquire their own
 house. Year after year such people paid the hire money for the
 piano and expended two or three times as much money in this way as
 the piano was worth. But what is feasible with regard to a piano
 is feasible with regard to a house. However, as a house costs
 more than a piano, a longer period is necessary to pay off the
 purchase price in rent. In consequence the directors have come to
 an agreement with house owners in various parts of London and its
 suburbs, as a result of which they are in a position to offer the
 members of the Birkbeck Building Society and others a great
 selection of houses in all parts of the town. The system
 according to which the board of directors intends to work is the
 following: it will let these houses for twelve and a half years
 and at the end of this period, providing that the rent has been
 paid regularly, the tenant will become the absolute owner of his
 house without any further payment of any kind. The tenant can
 also contract for a shorter space of time with a higher rental, or
 for a longer space of time with a lower rental. People of limited
 income, clerks, shop assistants and others can make themselves
 independent of landlords immediately by becoming members of the
 Birkbeck Building Society.” <span class="context">[Retranslated from the German.-Ed.]</span></p>
<p>
That is clear enough. There is no mention of workers, but rather of people
of limited income, clerks and shop assistants, etc., and in addition it
is assumed that, as a rule, the applicants already possess a piano. In
fact we have to do here not with workers, but with petty bourgeois and
those who would like and are able to become petty bourgeois; people whose
incomes gradually rise as a rule, even if within certain limits, such as
clerks and employees in similar occupations. The income of the worker,
however, in the best case remains the same in amount, and in reality it
falls in proportion to the increase of his family and its growing needs.
In fact, few workers can take part in such societies and then only in exceptional
cases. On the one hand their income is too low, and on the other hand it
is of too uncertain a character for them to be able to undertake responsibilities
for twelve and a half years ahead. The few exceptions where this is not
valid are either better-paid workers or foremen.</p>
<p>[We add here a little contribution on the way in which these building
societies and in particular the London building societies are managed.
As is known, almost the whole of the land on which London is built belongs
to a dozen aristocrats, including the most eminent, the Duke of Westminster,
the Duke of Bedford, the Duke of Portland, etc. They originally leased
out the separate building plots for a period of ninety-nine years, and
at the end of that period they take possession of the land with everything
on it. They then let the houses on shorter leases, thirty-nine years for
example, with a so-called repairing clause, according to which the leaseholder
must put the house in good repair and maintain it in such condition. As
soon as the contract has progressed thus far. the ground landlord sends
his architect and the district surveyor to inspect the house and determine
the repairs necessary. These repairs are often very considerable and may
include the renewal of the whole frontage, or of the roof, etc. The leaseholder
now deposits his lease as a security with a building society and receives
from this society a loan of the necessary money – up to L1000 and more
in the case of an annual rental-of from £130 to £150 – for the building
repairs which are to be carried out at his cost. These building societies
have thus become an important intermediate link in a system which aims
at securing the continual renewal and maintenance in habitable condition
of London’s houses belonging to the landed aristocracy without any trouble
to the latter and at the cost of the public. And this is supposed to be
a solution of the housing question for the workers! — Note by F. Engels
to the second German edition.]</p>
<p>For the rest, it is clear to everyone that the Bonapartists of
the workers’ town of Mulhausen are nothing more than miserable imitators
of these petty-bourgeois English building societies. The sole difference
is that the former, in spite of the state assistance granted to them, swindle
their clients far more than the building societies do. On the whole their
terms are less liberal than the average existing in England, and while
in England interest and compound interest is reckoned on each deposit and
the latter also can be withdrawn at a month’s notice, the factory owners
of Mulhausen put both interest and compound interest into their own pockets
and repay no more than the amount paid in by the workers in hard-earned
five-franc pieces. And no one will be more astonished at this difference
than Herr Sax who has it all in his book without knowing it.</p>
<p>Thus workers’ self-help is also no good. There remains state assistance.
What can Herr Sax offer us in this connection? Three things:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “First of all, the state must take care that in its legislation
 and administration, all those things which in any way result in
 accentuating the housing shortage among the working classes are
 abolished or appropriately remedied.” (Page 187.)</p>
<p>
Consequently, revision of building legislation and freedom for the building
trades in order that building shall be cheaper. But in England building
legislation is reduced to a minimum, the building trades are as free as
the birds in the air; nevertheless, the housing shortage exists. In addition,
building is now carried out so cheaply in England that the houses totter
when a cart goes by and every day some of them collapse. Only yesterday
(October 25, 1872) six of them collapsed simultaneously in Manchester and
seriously injured six workers. Therefore, that is also no remedy.</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “Secondly, the state power must prevent individuals in their
 narrow-minded individualism from reproducing the evil or causing
 it anew.” </p>
<p>
Consequently, inspection of workers’ dwellings by the sanitary authorities
and building inspectors; the authorities to have power to close down dilapidated
and unhygienic houses, as has been the case in England since 1857. But
how did it work there? The first law of 1855 (the Nuisances Removal Act)
remained, as Herr Sax admits himself, “a dead letter,” as also did the
second law of 1858 (the Local Government Act). (Page 197.) On the other
hand Herr Sax believes that the third law (the Artisans’ Dwellings Act),
which applies only to towns with a population of over 10,000, “certainly
offers favorable testimony to the great understanding of the British Parliament
in social matters.” (Page 199.) But, as a matter of fact, this contention
does no more than offer “favorable testimony of the utter ignorance of
Dr. Sax in English matters.” That England in general is far in advance
of the continent in “social matters” is a matter of course. England is
the motherland of modern large-scale industry; the capitalist mode of production
has developed here most freely and extensively of all, its consequences
show themselves here most glaringly of all and therefore it is here also
that they first produce a reaction in the sphere of legislation. The best
proof of this is factory legislation. If, however, Herr Sax thinks that
an Act of Parliament only requires to become legally effective in order
to be carried immediately into practice as well, he is making a great mistake.
And this is true of the Local Government Act more than of any other act
(with the exception, of course, of the Workshops Act). The administration
of this law was entrusted to the urban authorities, which almost everywhere
in England are recognized centres of corruption of all kinds, nepotism
and jobbery.</p>
<p>[Jobbery is the exploitation of a public office to the private
advantage of the official or his family. If, for instance, the director
of the state telegraphs of a country becomes a sleeping partner in a paper
factory, provides this factory with timber from his forests, and then gives
the factory orders for supplying paper for the telegraph offices, then
that is a fairly small but quite a pretty “job,” inasmuch as it demonstrates
a complete understanding of the principles of jobbery; such as, for the
rest, in the case of Bismarck was a matter of course and to be, expected.
– Note by F. Engels.]</p>
<p>The agents of these urban authorities, who owe their positions
to all sorts of family considerations, are either incapable of carrying
into effect such social laws, or disinclined to do so. On the other hand,
it is precisely in England that the state officials who are entrusted with
the preparation and carrying into effect of social legislation are usually
distinguished by a strict sense of duty – although in a lesser degree
today than twenty or thirty years ago. In the town councils, the owners
of unsound and dilapidated dwellings are almost everywhere strongly represented
either directly or indirectly. The system of electing these town councils
according to small wards makes the elected members dependent on the pettiest
local interests and influences; no town councilor who desires to be re-elected
dare vote for the application of this law in his constituency. It is comprehensible
therefore with what aversion this law was received almost everywhere by
the local authorities, and that up to the present it has been applied only
in the most scandalous cases – and even then, as a general rule, only
as the result of the outbreak of some epidemic, such as in the case of
the small-pox epidemic last year in Manchester and Salford. Appeals to
the Home Secretary have up to the present been effective only in such cases,
for it is the principle of every Liberal government in England to propose
social reform laws only when compelled to do so and, if at all possible,
to avoid carrying into effect those already existing. The law in question,
like many others in England, has only the importance that, in the hands
of a government dominated by or under the pressure of the workers, a
government which would at last really administer it, it would be a powerful
weapon for making a breach in the existing social state of things.</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “Thirdly, the state power must,” according to Herr Sax, “make use
 of all the positive means at its disposal to remedy the existing
 housing shortage to the most comprehensive extent.” </p>
<p>
That is to say, it must build barracks, “truly model buildings,” for its
 “subordinate officials and servants” (but these are certainly not workers),
and “grant loans to municipalities, societies and also to private persons
with a view to improving the housing conditions of the working classes” 
(page 203), as is done in England under the Public Works Loan Act, and
as Louis Bonaparte has done in Paris and Mulhausen. But the Public Works
Loan Act also exists only on paper, the government places at the disposal
of the commissioners a maximum sum of £50,000 sterling, i.e., sufficient
to build at the utmost 400 cottages, that is to say, in forty years a total
of 16,000 cottages, or dwellings for at the most 80,000 persons – a drop
in the ocean! Even if we assume that after twenty years the funds at the
disposal of the commissioners were to double as a result of repayments,
that, therefore, during the past twenty years dwellings for a further 40,000
persons have been built, the whole still remains a drop in the ocean. And
as the cottages have an average life of no more than forty years, after
forty years the liquid assets of £50,000 or £100,000 must be used every
year to replace the most dilapidated, the oldest of the cottages.</p>
<p>Herr Sax declares on page 203 that this is carrying the principle
into practice correctly and to “an unlimited extent also.” And with the
confession that even in England and to “an unlimited extent” the state
has achieved next to nothing, Dr. Sax concludes his book, but not before
having delivered another moral homily to all concerned.</p>
<p>[In recent English Acts of Parliament giving the London building
authorities the right of expropriation for the purpose of new street construction,
a certain amount of consideration is given to the workers turned out of
their homes. A provision has been inserted that the new buildings to be
erected must be suitable for housing those classes of the population previously
living there. Big five or six storey tenement barracks are therefore erected
for the workers on the least valuable sites and in this way the letter
of the law is complied with. it remains to be seen how these buildings
will serve; the workers are unaccustomed to them and in the midst of the
old conditions in London they form a completely foreign development. In
the best case, however, they will provide new dwellings for hardly more
than a quarter of the workers actually evicted by the building operations.
– Note by F. Engels to the second German edition.]</p>
<p>It is perfectly clear that the existing state is neither able
nor willing to do anything to remedy the housing difficulty. The state
is nothing but the organized collective power of the possessing classes,
the landowners and the capitalists as against the exploited classes, the
peasants and the workers. What the individual capitalists (and it is here
only a question of these because in this matter the landowner who is also
concerned acts primarily as a capitalist) do not want, their state also
does not want. If therefore the individual capitalists deplore the housing
shortage, but can hardly be persuaded even superficially to palliate its
most terrifying consequences, then the collective capitalist, the state,
will not do much more. At the most it will see to it that the measure of
superficial palliation which has become standard is carried out everywhere
uniformly. And we have already seen that this is the case.</p>
<p>But, one might object, in Germany the bourgeoisie does not rule
as yet; in Germany the state is still to a certain extent a power hovering
independently over society as a whole, which for that very reason represents
the collective interests of society and not those of a single class. Such
a state can certainly do much that a bourgeois state cannot do, and one
could expect from it something quite different on the social field also.</p>
<p>That is the language of reactionaries. In reality, however, the
state as it exists at present in Germany is also the necessary product
of the social basis out of which it has developed. In Prussia – and Prussia
is now decisive – there exists side by side with a landowning aristocracy
which is still powerful, a comparatively young and markedly very cowardly
bourgeoisie, which up to the present has not won either direct political
domination, as in France, or more or less indirect as in England. Side
by side with these two classes, however, there exists further a rapidly
increasing proletariat which is intellectually highly developed and which
is becoming more and more organized every day. We find, therefore, in Germany
alongside of the basic condition of the old absolute monarchy, an equilibrium
between the landowning aristocracy and the bourgeoisie, also the basic
condition of modern Bonapartism, an equilibrium between the bourgeoisie
and the proletariat.</p>
<p>But both in the old absolute monarchy and in the modern Bonapartist
monarchy the real governing power lies in the hands of a special caste
of army officers and state officials. In Prussia this caste is supplemented
partly from its own ranks, partly from the lesser aristocracy owning the
entailed estates, more rarely the higher aristocracy, and least of all
from the bourgeoisie. The independence of this caste, which appears to
occupy a position outside and, so to speak, above society, gives the state
the semblance of independence in relation to society.</p>
<p>The state form which has developed with necessary logic in Prussia
(and, following the Prussian example, in the new imperial constitution
of Germany) out of these contradictory social conditions is pseudo-constitutionalism,
a form which is at once both the present-day form of the dissolution of
the old absolute monarchy and the form of existence of the Bonapartist
monarchy. In Prussia, pseudo-constitutionalism from 1848 to 1866 only concealed
and brought about the slow decay of the absolutist monarchy. However, since
1866, and still more since 1870, the transformation of social conditions
and thus the dissolution of the old state has proceeded openly in the view
of all and on a tremendously increasing scale.</p>
<p>The rapid development of industry and in particular of stock exchange
swindling has dragged all the ruling classes into the whirlpool of speculation.
The wholesale corruption imported from France in 1870 is developing at
an unprecedented rate. Stroussberg and Péreire take off their hats to each
other. Ministers, generals, princes and counts deal in shares in competition
with the cunningest stock-exchange Jews, and the state recognizes their
equality by conferring titles wholesale on these stock-exchange Jews. The
rural aristocracy, who have been industrialists for a long time as producers
of beet sugar and distillers, had long ago left the old and respectable
days behind and now swell the lists of directors of all sorts of sound
and unsound joint-stock companies. The bureaucracy is beginning more and
more to despise embezzlement as the sole means of improving its income;
it is turning its back on the state and beginning to hunt after the far
more lucrative posts on the administration of industrial enterprises. Those
who still remain in office follow the example of their superiors and speculate
in shares, or “participate” in railways, etc. One is even justified in
assuming that the lieutenants also have their hands in certain speculations.
In short, the decomposition of all the elements of the old state and the
transition from the absolute monarchy is in full swing, and with the next
big trade and industrial crisis not only will the present swindle collapse,
but the old Prussian state as well. [Even today, 1886, what holds together
the old Prussian state and its basis, the alliance of the big landowners
and the industrialist capitalists sealed by the protective tariffs is solely
the fear of the proletariat which has grown tremendously in numbers and
class consciousness since 1872. – Note by F. Engels to the second German
edition.]</p>
<p>And this state, in which the non-bourgeois elements are becoming
more bourgeois every day, is to solve “the social question,” or even only
the housing question? On the contrary. In all economic questions the Prussian
state is falling more and more into the hands of the bourgeoisie. And if
since 1866 legislation on the economic field has not been even more adapted
to the interests of the bourgeois than was actually the case, whose fault
is that? The bourgeoisie itself is chiefly responsible, being firstly too
cowardly to press its own demands energetically, and secondly resisting
every concession immediately the latter simultaneously gives the menacing
proletariat new weapons. And if the state power, i.e., Bismarck, is attempting
to organize its own bodyguard proletariat in order thereby to keep in check
the political activity of the bourgeoisie, what is that but a necessary
and familiar Bonapartist recipe which pledges the state to nothing more,
as far as the workers are concerned, than a few benevolent phrases and
at the utmost to a minimum of state assistance for building societies <i>à
la</i> Louis Bonaparte?</p>
<p>The best proof of what the workers have to expect from the Prussian
state lies in the utilization of the French milliards which has given a
new short reprieve to the independence of the Prussian state machine in
regard to society. Has even a single taler of all these milliards been
used to provide shelter for those Berlin working class families which have
been thrown on to the streets? On the contrary. As autumn approached, the
state even caused to be pulled down those few miserable huts which had
served the workers and their families as a temporary shelter during the
summer. The five milliards are being expended rapidly enough for fortresses,
cannon and soldiers; and despite Wagner von Dummerwitz, and despite Stieber’s
conferences with Austria, there will not be used for the German workers
even as much of those milliards as was used for the French workers out
of the millions which Louis Bonaparte stole from France.</p>
<p class="information"><span class="context">
[Engels alludes to the repeated declarations of the German political economist, Adolph Wagner, that if the favorable conjuncture created in Germany after the French-German war, were to be utilised to set up credits of five billions for France, it would have produced a meaningful improvement of the situation into which the working masses had been thrown. It does not appear that the Wagner, a university professor and member of the Prussian Senate, ever acquired a noble title; most likely, Engels is being satirical; <i>Dummerwitz</i> is equivalent, in fact, to  “dim wit.” ]</span></p>

<p class="fst">In reality the bourgeoisie has only one method of solving the housing
question after its fashion-that is to say, of solving it in such a way
that the solution continually reproduces the question anew. This method
is called “Haussmann.” </p>
<p>By the term “Haussmann” I do not mean merely the specifically
Bonapartist manner of the Parisian Haussmann – breaking long, straight
and broad streets through the closely-built workers’ quarters and erecting
big luxurious buildings on both sides of them, the intention thereby, apart
from the strategic aim of making barricade fighting more difficult, being
also to develop a specifically Bonapartist building trades’ proletariat
dependent on the government and to turn the city into a pure luxury city.
By “Haussmann” I mean the practice which has now become general of making
breaches in the working class quarters of our big towns, and particularly
in those which are centrally situated, quite apart from whether this is
done from considerations of public health and for beautifying the town,
or owing to the demand for big centrally situated business premises, or
owing to traffic requirements, such as the laying down of railways, streets,
etc. No matter how different the reasons may be, the result is everywhere
the same: the scandalous alleys and lanes disappear to the accompaniment
of lavish self-praise from the bourgeoisie on account of this tremendous
success, but they appear again immediately somewhere else and often in
the immediate neighborhood.</p>
<p>In <i>The Condition of the Working Class in England</i> I gave a description
of Manchester as it looked in 1843 and 1844. Since then the construction
of railways through the centre of the town, the laying out of new streets,
and the erection of great public and private buildings have broken through,
laid bare and improved some of the worst districts described in my book,
others have been abolished altogether, but many of them are still, apart
from the fact that official sanitary inspection has since become stricter,
in the same state or in an even worse state of dilapidation than they were
then. On the other hand, however, thanks to the enormous extension of the
town, whose population has increased since then by more than half, districts
which were at that time still airy and clean are now just as excessively
built upon, just as dirty and overcrowded as the most ill-famed parts of
the town formerly were.</p>
<p>Here is just one example: On page 80 and the following pages of
my book I describe a group of houses situated in the valley bottom of the
river Medlock, which under the name of Little Ireland was for years one
of the worst blots on Manchester. Little Ireland has long ago disappeared
and on its site there now stands a railway station built on a high foundation.
The bourgeoisie printed with pride to the happy and final abolition of
Little Ireland as to a great triumph. Now last summer a great inundation
took place, as in general the rivers embanked in our big towns cause extensive
floods year after year owing to easily understood causes. And it was then
revealed that Little Ireland had not been abolished at all, but had simply
been shifted from the south side of Oxford Road to the north side, and
that it still continues to flourish. Let us hear what the Manchester Weekly
Times, the organ of the radical bourgeoisie of Manchester, has to say in
its number of July 20, 1872:</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “The misfortune which befell the inhabitants of the lower valley
 of the Medlock last Saturday will, it is to be hoped, have one
 good result: namely that public attention will be directed to the
 obvious mockery of all the laws of hygiene which has been
 tolerated there so long under the noses of our municipal officials
 and our municipal health committee. A forcible article in our
 daily edition yesterday revealed, though hardly trenchantly
 enough, the scandalous condition of some of the cellar dwellings
 near Charles Street and Brook Street which were reached by the
 floods. A detailed examination of one of the courts mentioned in
 this article enables us to confirm all the statements made about
 them, and to declare that the cellar dwellings in this court
 should long ago have been closed down, or rather, they should
 never have been tolerated as human habitations. Squire’s Court is
 made up of seven or eight dwelling houses on the corner of Charles
 Street and Brook Street. Even at the lowest part of Brook Street,
 under the railway bridge, a pedestrian may pass daily and never
 dream that human beings are living under his feet in what are
 little more than caves. The court itself is hidden from public
 view and is accessible only to those who are compelled by their
 impoverishment to seek a shelter in its sepulchral seclusion.
 Even if the usually stagnant waters of the Medlock, which are shut
 in between locks, do not exceed their usual level, the floors of
 these dwellings can hardly be more than a few inches above the
 surface of the river. A good shower of rain is capable of driving
 up filthy and nauseous water through the drains and filling the
 rooms with pestilential gases such as every flood leaves behind it
 as a souvenir....</p>
<p class="quoteb"> “Squire’s Court lies at a still lower level than the uninhabited
 cellars of the houses in Brook Street-twenty feet lower than the
 street level, and the foul water driven up on Saturday through the
 drains reached to the roofs. We knew this and therefore expected
 that we should find the place uninhabited or occupied only by the
 sanitary officials engaged in cleaning the stinking walls and
 disinfecting the houses. Instead of this we saw a man, in the
 cellar home of a barber, engaged in shoveling a heap of
 decomposing filth, which lay in a corner, onto a wheelbarrow. The
 barber, whose cellar was already more or less cleaned up, sent us
 still lower down to a number of dwellings about which he declared
 that, if he could write, he would have written to the press to
 demand that they be closed down. And so finally we came to
 Squire’s Court where we found a buxom and healthy-looking
 Irishwoman busy at the washtub. She and her husband, a night
 watchman, had lived for six years in the court and had a numerous
 family.... In the house which they had just left, the water had
 risen almost to the roof, the windows were broken and the
 furniture was reduced to ruins. The man declared that the
 occupant of the house had been able to keep the smells from
 becoming intolerable only by whitewashing it every two months....
 In the inner court, into which our correspondent then went, he
 found three houses whose rear walls abutted on the rear walls of
 the houses just described. Two of these three houses were
 inhabited. The smell there was so frightful that the healthiest
 man would have felt sick in a very short space of time.... This
 disgusting hole was inhabited by a family of seven, all of whom
 had slept in the place on Thursday evening (the first day the
 water rose). Or rather, not slept, as the woman immediately
 corrected herself, for she and her husband had vomited continually
 the greater part of the night owing to the terrible smell. On
 Saturday they had been compelled to wade through the water, chest
 high, to carry out their children. She was of the opinion that
 the place was not fit for pigs to live in, but on account of the
 low rent – one and sixpence a week – she had taken it, because
 her husband had been out of work a lot recently owing to sickness.
 The impression made upon the observer by this court and the
 inhabitants huddled in it, as though in a premature grave, was one
 of utter helplessness. We must point out, by the way, that,
 according to our observations, Squire’s Court is no more than
 typical – though perhaps an extreme case – of many other places
 in the neighborhood whose continued existence our health committee
 should not countenance. Should the committee permit these places
 to be inhabited in the future then it is taking on itself a
 responsibility whose gravity we shall not discuss further here,
 and it is exposing the whole neighborhood to the danger of
 infectious epidemics.” <span class="context">[Retranslated from the German.-Ed.]</span></p>
<p>
This is a striking example of how the bourgeoisie solves the housing question
in practice. The breeding places of disease, the infamous holes and cellars
in which the capitalist mode of production confines our workers night after
night, are not abolished; they are merely shifted elsewhere! The same economic
necessity which produced them in the first place, produces them in the
next place also. As long as the capitalist mode of production continues
to exist, it is folly to hope for an isolated solution of the housing question
or of any other social question affecting the fate of the workers. The
solution lies in the abolition of the capitalist mode of production and
the appropriation of all the means of life and labor by the working class
itself.</p>

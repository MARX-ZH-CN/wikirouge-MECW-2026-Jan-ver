<h3>To the Editors of <i>Woodhull &amp; Claflin’s Weekly</i></h3>
<hr class="end"/><p class="information"><span class="info">Source</span>: the <i>Woodhull &amp; Claflin’s Weekly</i>, October 21, 1871; <br>
<span class="info">Transcribed</span>: for marxists.org by Tony Brown.</p><hr class="end"/>
<p class="fst">London, N. W., September 23, 1871</p>
<p class="fst"><i>Mesdames</i>:</p>
<p>I have the honor to send you, for insertion in your Weekly — if you judge the contribution sufficiently interesting for your readers — a short relation of my daughter Jenny on the persecutions she and her sisters, during their stay at Bagneres de Luchon (Pyrenees), had to undergo at the hands of the French Government. This tragico-comical episode seems to me characteristic of the Republic-Thiers.</p>
<p>The news of my death was concocted at Paris by the Avenir libéral, a Bonapartist paper.</p>
<p>Since Sunday last a private Conference of the delegates of the International Workingmen’s Association is sitting at London. The proceedings will terminate to-day.</p>
<p>With my best thanks for the highly interesting papers you had the kindness to send me,</p>
<p>I have the honor, Mesdames, to remain,</p>
<p>Yours most sincerely.</p>

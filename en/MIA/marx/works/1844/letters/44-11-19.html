<i>No. 2</i>
<p class="fst"><strong><i>Barmen, 19 November 1844</i></strong>
<p class="fst">Dear M.,

<p class="fst">About a fortnight ago I received a few lines
from you and Buergers dated 8 October and postmarked Brussels, 27 October.
<sup class="enote"><a href="#n1">[1]</a></sup> At about the same time you wrote your note I sent
off a letter to you, addressed to your wife, and trust that you received
it. In order to make sure in future that our letters are not tampered with,
I suggest we number them, thus my present one is No 2 and, when you write,
let me know up to what number you have received and whether one is missing
from the series

<p class="fst">A couple of days ago I was in Cologne and Bonn. All goes well
in Cologne. Grun will have told you about our people's activities. Hess
is thinking of joining you in Paris, too, in a fortnight or three weeks
time, provided he can get hold of sufficient money. You now have Buergers
there as well and hence enough for a council. You will have all the less
need of me and there is all the more need for me here. Obviously I can't
come now since it would mean falling out with my entire family. Besides
I have a love affair to clear up first and after all, one of us ought to
be here because all our people need prodding if they are to maintain a
sufficient degree of activity and not fall into all manner of shuffling
and shifting. Jung, for instance as well as many others, cannot be convinced
that the difference between us and Ruge is one of principle, <sup class="enote"><a href="#n2">[2]</a></sup>
and still persists in believing that it is merely a personal squabble.
When told that Ruge is no communist, they don't quite believe it and assert
that in any case it would be a pity if such a 'literary authority' as Ruge
were to be thoughtlessly discarded. What is one to say to that? One must
wait until Ruge once again delivers himself of some monumental stupidity,
so that the fact can be demonstrated <i>ad oculos</i> <sup class="enote"><a href="#n3">[3]</a></sup>
to these people. I don't know, but there's something not quite right about
Jung; the fellow hasn't enough determination.

<p class="fst">We are at present holding public meetings all over the place to
set up societies for the advancement of the workers <sup class="enote"><a href="#n4">[4]</a></sup>
; this causes a fine stir among the Teutons and draws the philistines'
attention to social problems. These meetings are arranged on the spur of
the moment and without asking the police. We have seen to it that half
the rules-drafting committee in Cologne consists of our own people; in
Elberfeld, at least one of them was on it and, with the help of the rationalists,
<sup class="enote"><a href="#n5">[5]</a></sup> we succeeded at two meetings in thoroughly trouncing
the pious; by a huge majority, everything Christian was banned from the
rules. <sup class="enote"><a href="#n6">[6]</a></sup> It amused me to see what a ridiculous figure
these rationalists cut with their theoretical Christianity and practical
atheism. In principle they entirely agreed with the Christian opposition,
although in practice, Christianity, which according to their own assertions
forms the basis of the society, must nowhere be mentioned in the rules.
The rules were to cover everything save the vital principle of the society!
So rigidly did the fellows cling to this absurd position that, even without
my putting in a single word, we acquired a set of rules which, as things
are now, leaves nothing to be desired. There is to be another meeting next
Sunday, but I shan't be able to attend because I am leaving for Westphalia
tomorrow.

<p class="fst">I am up to my eyebrows in English newspapers and books upon which
I am drawing for my book on the condition of the English proletarians.
<sup class="enote"><a href="#n7">[7]</a></sup> I expect to finish it by the middle or the end of
January, having got through the arrangement of the material, the most arduous
part of the work, about a week or a fortnight ago. I shall be presenting
the English with a fine bill of indictment; I accuse the English bourgeoisie
before the entire world of murder, robbery and other crimes on a massive
scale, and I am writing an English preface <sup class="enote"><a href="#n8">[8]</a></sup> which
I shall have printed separately and sent to English party leaders, men
of letters and members of Parliament. That'll give those fellows something
to remember me by. It need hardly be said that my blows, though aimed at
the panniers, are meant for the donkey, namely the German bourgeoisie,
to whom I make it plain enough that they are as bad as their English counterparts,
except that their sweat-shop methods are not as bold, thorough and ingenious. – 
As soon as I've finished this, I shall make a start on the history of the
social development of the English, <sup class="enote"><a href="#n9">[9]</a></sup> which will be still less laborious,
since I already have the material for it and have sorted it out in my head,
and also because I'm perfectly clear about the matter. Meanwhile I shall
probably write a few pamphlets, notably against <i>List</i> <sup class="enote"><a href="#n10">[10]</a></sup>
<i>as soon as I have the time.</i>
<p class="fst">You will have heard of Stirner's book, <i>Der Einzige und sein
Eigenthum</i> <sup class="enote"><a href="#n11">[11]</a></sup> , if it hasn't reached you yet. Wigand
sent me the specimen sheets, which I took with me to Cologne and left with
Hess. The noble Stirner – you'll recall Schmidt of Berlin, who wrote about
the <i>Mysteres</i> in Buhl's magazine <sup class="enote"><a href="#n12">[12]</a></sup> – takes
for his principle Bentham's egoism, except that in one respect it is carried
through more logically and in the other less so. More logically in the
sense that Stirner as an atheist sets the ego above God, or rather depicts
him as the be-all and end-all, whereas Bentham still allows God to remain
remote and nebulous above him; that Stirner, in short, is riding on German
idealism, an idealist who has turned to materialism and empiricism, whereas
Bentham is simply an empiricist. Stirner is less logical in the sense that
he would like to avoid the reconstruction effected by Bentham of a society
reduced to atoms, but cannot do so. This egoism is simply the essence of
present society and present man brought to consciousness, the ultimate
that can be said against us by present society, the culmination of all
the theory intrinsic to the prevailing stupidity. But that's precisely
what makes the thing important, more important than Hess, for one, holds
it to be. We must not simply cast it aside, but rather use it as the perfect
expression of present-day folly and, <i>while inverting it</i>, continue
to build on it. This egoism is taken to such a pitch, it is so absurd and
at the same time so self-aware, that it cannot maintain itself even for
an instant in its one-sidedness, but must immediately change into communism.
In the first place it's a simple matter to prove to Stirner that his egoistic
man is bound to become communist out of sheer egoism. That's the way to
answer the fellow. In the second place he must be told that in its egoism
the human heart is of itself, from the very outset, unselfish and self-sacrificing,
so that he finally ends up with what he is combating. These few platitudes
will suffice to refute the <i>one-sidedness.</i> But we must also adopt
such truth as there is in the principle. And it is certainly true that
we must first make a cause our own, egoistic cause, before we can do anything
to further it – and hence that in this sense, irrespective of any eventual
material aspirations, we are communists out of egoism also, and it is out
of egoism that we wish to be <i>human beings</i>, not mere individuals.
Or to put it another way. Stirner is right in rejecting Feuerbach's ‘man’,
or at least the ‘man’ of <i>Das Wesen des Christentums.</i> <sup class="enote"><a href="#n13">[13]</a></sup>
Feuerbach deduces his ‘man’ from God, it is from God that he arrives at
‘man’, and hence ‘man’ is crowned with a theological halo of abstraction.
The true way to arrive at ‘man’ is the other way about. We must take our
departure from the Ego, the empirical, flesh-and-blood individual, if we
are not, like Stirner, to remain stuck at this point but rather proceed
to raise ourselves to ‘man’. ‘man’ will always remain a wraith so long
as his basis is not empirical man. In short we must take our departure
from empiricism and materialism if our concepts, and notably our ‘man’,
are to be something real; we must deduce the general from the particular,
not from itself or, <i>à la</i> Hegel, from thin air. All these are platitudes
needing no explanation; they have already been spelled out by Feuerbach
and I wouldn't have reiterated them had not Hess-presumably because of
his earlier idealistic leanings – so dreadfully traduced empiricism, more
especially Feuerbach and now Stirner. Much of what Hess says about Feuerbach
is right; on the other hand he still seems to suffer from a number of idealistic
aberrations – whenever he begins to talk about theoretical matters he
always proceeds by categories and therefore cannot write in a popular fashion
because he is much too abstract. Hence he also hates any and every kind
of egoism, and preaches the love of humanity, etc., which again boils down
to Christian self-sacrifice. If, however, the flesh-and-blood individual
is the true basis, the true point of departure, for our ‘man’, it follows
that egoism – not of course Stirner's intellectual egoism <i>alone</i>, but
also the <i>egoism of the heart</i> – is the point of departure for our
love of humanity, which otherwise is left hanging in the air. Since Hess
will soon be with you, you'll be able to discuss this with him yourself.
Incidentally, I find all this theoretical twaddle daily more tedious and
am irritated by every word that has to be expended on the subject of ‘man’,
by every line that has to be read or written against theology and abstraction
no less than against crude materialism. But it's quite another matter when,
instead of concerning oneself with all these phantasms – for such even
unrealised man remains until the moment of his realisation – one turns
to real, live things, to historical developments and consequences. That,
at least, is the best we can hope for so long as we're confined exclusively
to wielding a pen and cannot realise our thoughts directly with our hands
or, if need be, with our fists.

<p class="fst">But Stirner's book demonstrates yet again how deeply abstraction
is rooted in the Berliners' nature. Clearly Stirner is the most talented,
independent and hard-working of the 'Free', <sup class="enote"><a href="#n14">[14]</a></sup> but
for all that he tumbles out of idealistic into materialistic abstraction
and ends up in limbo. From all over Germany comes news of the progress
made by socialism, but from Berlin not a whisper. When property has been
abolished throughout Germany these clever-clever Berliners will set up
a <i>democratie pacifique</i> <sup class="enote"><a href="#n15">[15]</a></sup> on the Hasenheide
– but the fellows will certainly get no further. Watch out! A new Messiah
will presently arise in the Uckermark, a Messiah who will tailor Fourier
to accord with Hegel; erect a phalanstery upon the eternal categories and
lay it down as an eternal law of the self-developing idea that capital,
talent and labour all have a definite share in the product. This will be
the New Testament of Hegelianism, old Hegel will be the Old Testament,
the 'state', the law, will be a 'taskmaster over Christ', <sup class="enote"><a href="#n16">[16]</a></sup>
and the phalanstery, in which the privies are located in accordance with
logical necessity, will be the 'new Heaven' and the 'new Earth', the new
Jerusalem descending from heaven decked out like a bride, <sup class="enote"><a href="#n17">[17]</a></sup>
all of which the reader will be able to find expounded at greater length
in the new Revelation. And when all this has been completed, Critical Criticism
will supervene, declare that it is all in all, that it combines in its
head capital, talent and labour, that everything that is produced is produced
by <i>it</i>, and not by the powerless masses – and sequestrate everything
for itself. That will be the end of Berlin's Hegelian [peace]ful democracy.

<p class="fst">If <i>Critical Criticism</i> <sup class="enote"><a href="#n18">[18]</a></sup> is finished,
send me a few copies under sealed cover through the booksellers – they
might be confiscated. In case you [didn't re]ceive my last letter, I repeat
that you can write to me either [...] F. E. <i>junior, Barmen</i>, or under
sealed cover to F. W. Struecker and Co., Elberfeld. This letter is being
sent to you by a roundabout route.

<p class="fst">Write soon – it's more than two months since I last heard from
you – how goes it with <i>Vorwarts?</i> My greetings to all.

<p class="information"><a id="n2"></a><span class="info">2.</span> The disagreement between Marx and
Engels on the one hand and Arnold Ruge on the other dated back to the time
of the publication of the <i>Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher</i>, under
the editorship of Marx and Ruge. These disagreements were due to Ruge's
negative attitude towards communism and the revolutionary proletarian movement,
the fundamental difference between Marx's view and those of the Young Hegelian
Ruge, who was an adherent of philosophical idealism. The final break between
Marx and Ruge occurred in March 1844. Ruge's condemnation of the Silesian
weavers' rising in June 1844 impelled Marx to criticize his views in the
article "Critical Marginal Notes on the Article 'The King of Prussia and
Social Reform. By a Prussian.'"</p>

the Benefit of the Working Classes formed in a number of Prussian towns
in 1844 and 1845 on the initiatives of the German liberal bourgeoisie,
who were alarmed at the rising of the Silesian weavers in the summer of
1844, and hoped that the associations would help to divert the German workers
from militant struggle. Despite the efforts of the bourgeoisie and the
government authorities to give these associations a harmless philanthropic
appearance, they gave a fresh impulse to the growing political activity
of the urban masses and drew the attention of broad sections of German
society to social questions. The movement to establish such associations
was particularly widespread in the towns of the industrial Rhine Province.</p>
<p class="information">Seeing the associations had taken such an unexpected direction,
the Prussian Government hastily cut short their activity in the spring
of 1845 by refusing to approve their statutes and forbidding them to continue
their work.</p>

10 November 1844 and attended by former shareholders of and contributors
to the <i>Rheinische Zeitung</i>, liberals Ludolf Camphausen, Gustav Mevissen,
radicals Georg Jung, Karl d'Ester, Franz Raveaux and others among them,
a General Association for Relief and Education was set up with the aim
of improving the workers' condition (the measures to be taken included
raising funds for mutual assistance and relief to the sick, etc.). Despite
the opposition of the liberals, the meeting adopted democratic rules which
provided for the workers' active participation in the work of the Association.
Subsequently a definitive split took place between the radical-democratic
elements and the liberals. The latter headed by Camphausen withdrew from
the Association, which was soon prohibited by the Authorities.</p>
<p class="information">In November 1844, an Educational Society was set up in Elberfeld.
Its founders had from the very start to fight against the local clergy,
who attempted to bring the Society under the influence and give its activity
a religious colouring. Engels and his friends wished to use the Society's
meetings and its committee to spread communist views. As Engels had expected,
the statute of the Society was not approved by the authorities, and the
Society itself ceased to exist in the spring of 1845.</p>

<p class="information"><a id="n9"></a><span class="info">9.</span> Originally Engels planned to write
a book on the social history of England and to devote one of its chapters
to the condition of the working class in England. But, realizing the special
role played by the proletariat in bourgeois society, he decided to deal
with this problem in a separate book, which he wrote on his return to Germany,
between September 1844 and March 1845. Excerpts in Engels' notebooks made
in July and August 1845, and the letters of the publisher Leske to Marx
of 14 May and 7 June 1845 show that in the spring and summer of 1845 Engels
continued to work on the social history of England. Though he did not abandon
his plan up to the end of 1847, as is seen from an item in the
<i>Deutsche-Brusseler-Zeitung</i>, No. 91 or 14 November 1847, he failed to
put it into effect.</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n10"></a><span class="info">10.</span> Engels did not write a pamphlet
on Friedrich List's book <i>Das nationale System der politischen ökonomie</i>
(Stuttgart und Tuebingen, 1841) though later he continued to discuss this
idea with Marx, who in his turn intended to publish a critical analysis
of List's reviews. Engels criticized the German advocates of protectionism,
and List above all, in one of his "Speeches in Elberfeld." </p>

of Young Hegelians formed early in 1842. Among its prominent members were
Edgar Bauer, Eduard Meven, Ludwig Buhl and Max Stirner (pseudonym of Kaspar
Schmidt). Their criticism of the prevailing conditions was abstract, devoid
of real revolutionary content and ultra-radical in form. The fact that
 "The Free" lacked any positive programme and ignored the realities of political
struggle soon led to differences between them and the representatives of
the revolutionary-democratic wing of the German opposition movement. A
sharp conflict arose between "The Free" and Marx in the autumn of 1842,
when Marx had become editor of the <i>Rheinische Zeitung</i>.</p>
<p class="information">During the last two years which had elapsed since Marx's clash
with "The Free" (1843-44), Marx and Engels' disagreement with the Young
Hegelians on questions of theory and politics had deepened still more.
This was accounted for not only by Marx's and Engels' transition to materialism
and communism, but also by the evolution in the ideas of the Bauer brothers
and their fellow-thinkers. In the <i>Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung</i>,
Bauer and his group renounced the "radicalism of 1842" and, besides professing
subjective idealist views and counterposing chosen personalities, the
bearers of "pure Criticism," to the allegedly sluggish and inert masses,
they began spreading the ideas of moderate liberal philanthropy.</p>
<p class="information">It was to the exposure of the Young Hegelians' view in the form
which they had acquired in 1844 and to the defence of their own new materialistic
and communistic outlook that Marx and Engels decided to devote their first
joint work <i>The Holy Family, or Critique of Critical Criticism. Against

<p class="fst">Dear Sir,

<p class="fst">It is impossible for me to let you have the
review of Stirner before next week. Therefore deliver the specimen copy
without my contribution; Buergers will let you have an article in its stead.</p>
<p>You shall have my article next week.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully</p>
<p><i>Marx</i></p>

<h3>NOTES</h3>
<p class="fst">
Here, Marx writes about the <i>Vorwarts! Pariser Deutsche Monatsschrift</i>
which Heinrich Boernstein planned to publish instead of the newspaper
<i>Vorwarts!</i> The prospectus of the monthly published in German and
French on 1 January 1845 (its publication date helps in determining the
approximate date of this letter) stated that one of the reasons for the
reformation of <i>Vorwarts!</i> was that no caution-money was needed for
publishing a journal as distinct from a newspaper. The journal of eight
printed sheets was to appear on the 16th of each month. The expulsion of Marx
and other contributors to <i>Vorwarts!</i> from France prevented the
publication of the first issue, the proof sheets of which had already been
printed.</p>
<p>As is seen from this letter, and that of Engels to Marx written
approximately 20 January 1845, Marx intended to write a critical review
of Stirner's <i>Der Einzige und sein Eigenthum</i> at the end of December
1844 and originally wanted to publish it in the monthly <i>Vorwarts!</i>
There is no information on whether this plan materialized. It is only known
that two years later, Marx and Engels scathingly criticized Stirner's book
in the <i>German Ideology</i>.</p>

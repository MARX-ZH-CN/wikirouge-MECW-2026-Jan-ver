<h1>Letter to the Editor of<br>
<i>The Northern Star</i> <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume03/footnote.html#224" target=_blank>[224]</a></sup></h1>
<hr class="end"/><p class="information"><span class="info">Source</span>: MECW Volume 3, p. 514;<br>
<span class="info">Written</span>: late in April 1844;<br>
<span class="info">First published</span>: in <i>The Northern Star</i>; No. 338, May 4, 1844.</p><hr class="end"/>
<p>I propose furnishing you with reports concerning the progress of the movement party on the Continent for the <i>Star</i>, extracts from the German papers, and of my correspondence with well-informed men in Paris and Germany. I see with pleasure, that your paper contains more and better information about the state of public opinion in France than all other English papers together; and I should like to place you in the same position as far as regards Germany. The political state of Germany is becoming more important every day. We shall have a revolution there very shortly, which cannot but end in establishment of a Federal Republic. <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume03/footnote.html#225" target=_blank>[225]</a></sup> At the same time, I shall not confine, myself to Germany, but report to you everything about Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Russia, &amp;c., which will be likely to prove interesting to your readers; and I shall leave it entirely to yourself to make what use you think proper of the materials furnished by me.</p>

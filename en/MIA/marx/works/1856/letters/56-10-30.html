<p>... In Mieroslawski <sup class="enote"><a href="#n1">[1]</a></sup> you will notice yourself: 1) that the same person who considers ‘a diplomatic kingdom’ in Poland impossible wanted to make there ‘<i>a diplomatic revolution</i>’, that is, under the auspices of Louis Bonaparte and Palmerston; 2) that the fate of the ‘democratic’ Lechitic community was inevitable. The dominium proper is usurped by the crown, the aristocracy, etc; the patriarchal relations between the dominium and the peasant communities lead to serfdom; optional parcellation creates a sort of <i>peasant middle class</i>, the <i>Equestrian Order</i>, <sup class="enote"><a href="#n2">[2]</a></sup> to which the peasant can rise only so long as war of conquest and colonisation continue, both of which, however, are also conditions which accelerate his downfall. As soon as the limit has been reached this Equestrian Order, incapable of playing the role of a real middle class, is transformed into the lumpen-proletariat of the aristocracy. The dominium and the peasants among the Latin population of Moldavia, Walachia, etc, have a similar fate. This kind of development is interesting because here serfdom can be shown to have arisen in a purely economic way, without the intermediate link of conquest and racial dualism...</p>

<p>... As for subscriptions to your essay, <sup class="enote"><a href="#n2">[2]</a></sup><b> </b>I shall do <i>all I possibly can</i>, but expect little success. The ragtag and bobtail that make up the various societies  –  with the exception of the Workers Educational Association which has no <i>funds </i>whatever  –  are all <i>constitutionally </i>disposed, and even favour the Prussian National Association. <sup class="enote"><a href="#n3">[3]</a></sup> Those fellows would rather give money to suppress an essay like yours. I must tell you, these Germans, young and old, are all very clever, robust, prudent and practical men; they consider people like you and me immature fools who have still not been cured of their revolutionary fantasies. And that riff-raff is as bad at home as it is here abroad. During my stay in Berlin and elsewhere I convinced myself that any attempt to influence that mob <i>by means of literature </i>was absolutely futile. The self-complacent stupidity of those fellows, who regard their press, that woebegone press, as an admirable elixir of life, is simply incredible. Add to this that mental lassitude: <i>caning </i>is the only means to resurrect the ordinary German who, ever since he lost his philosophical illusions and took to moneymaking, and moreover to the idea of ‘Little Germany’ and ‘practical constitutionalism’, has become a superficial impulsive clown... </p>

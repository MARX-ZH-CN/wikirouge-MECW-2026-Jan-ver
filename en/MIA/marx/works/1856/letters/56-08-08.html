<h4>[London,] 8 August 1856, 28 Dean Street, Soho</h4>
<p>My one and only Sweetheart,</p>
<p>This morning, at the same time as your letter, I received a note from Frederic containing 15 talers for Lenchen. <i>Acknowledge it,</i> as he is most meticulous in such matters. More tomorrow; today I have the ‘<strong>Immortal Collet’,</strong> here in the room with me and am keeping him in check by saying *‘I am obliged to write some lines to Mrs Marx’*.</p>
<p><strong>Lily-white, sandy</strong> is settled <strong>in reality</strong><i>, </i>not <strong>in fancy</strong><i>.</i></p>
<p>Much though I hanker after you and the children — and this <strong>quite</strong><i> indescribably — </i>I should like you to stay on in Trier <i>for another week. </i>It would do you and the children no end of good. More tomorrow.</p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. M.</p>
<p>P.S. The Urquhartites are being damned importunate. A good thing financially. But I don’t know whether, <strong>politically</strong>, I ought to get too involved with the fellows. A thousand kisses, my beloved sweetheart.</p>
<p>P.S.II. Lina as got the famous post. Won’t be taking it up <i>for</i> <i>weeks </i>yet.</p>
<p>It’s ghastly for me, having to play the man of fashion <i>chez</i> Liebknecht now. <strong>Hang it!</strong> On top of that, I have Pieper sleeping with me in your stead. <strong>Horrible</strong>. In the same room, at any rate. <i>Engels is coming next week.</i> That’s a relief. For 3 weeks I've been as hypochondriacal as the devil.</p>

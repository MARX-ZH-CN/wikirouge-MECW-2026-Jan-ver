<p class="title">Condition of the Working Class in England, by Engels, 1845</p>
<h1>Results</h1>
<p>Having now investigated, somewhat in detail, the conditions under which the
English working-class lives, it is time to draw some further inferences from
the facts presented, and then to compare our inferences with the actual state
of things. Let us see what the workers themselves have become under the given
circumstances, what sort of people they are, what their physical, mental, and
moral status. </p>
<p>When one individual inflicts bodily injury upon another such injury that
death results, we call the deed manslaughter; when the assailant knew in
advance that the injury would be fatal, we call his deed murder. But when
society <a href="#1" id="[1]"></a><a href="#1" id="[1]"><sup class="enote">[1]</sup></a> places hundreds of proletarians in such a position
that they inevitably meet a too early and an unnatural death, one which is
quite as much a death by violence as that by the sword or bullet; when it
deprives thousands of the necessaries of life, places them under conditions in
which they cannot live – forces them, through the strong arm of the law,
to remain in such conditions until that death ensues which is the inevitable
consequence – knows that these thousands of victims must perish, and yet
permits these conditions to remain, its deed is murder just as surely as the
deed of the single individual; disguised, malicious murder, murder against
which none can defend himself, which does not seem what it is, because no man
sees the murderer, because the death of the victim seems a natural one, since
the offence is more one of omission than of commission. But murder it remains.
I have now to prove that society in England daily and hourly commits what the
working-men's organs, with perfect correctness, characterise as social murder,
that it has placed the workers under conditions in which they can neither
retain health nor live long; that it undermines the vital force of these
workers gradually, little by little, and so hurries them to the grave before
their time. I have further to prove that society knows how injurious such
conditions are to the health and the life of the workers, and yet does nothing
to improve these conditions. That it knows the consequences of its deeds; that
its act is, therefore, not mere manslaughter, but murder, I shall have proved,
when I cite official documents, reports of Parliament and of the Government, in
substantiation of my charge. </p>
<p>That a class which lives under the conditions already sketched and is so
ill-provided with the most necessary means of subsistence, cannot be healthy
and can reach no advanced age, is self-evident. Let us review the circumstances
once more with especial reference to the health of the workers. The
centralisation of population in great cities exercises of itself an
unfavourable influence; the atmosphere of London can never be so pure, so rich
in oxygen, as the air of the country; two and a half million pairs of lungs,
two hundred and fifty thousand fires, crowded upon an area three to four miles
square, consume an enormous amount of oxygen, which is replaced with
difficulty, because the method of building cities in itself impedes
ventilation. The carbonic acid gas, engendered by respiration and fire, remains
in the streets by reason of its specific gravity, and the chief air current
passes over the roofs of the city. The lungs of the inhabitants fail to receive
the due supply of oxygen, and the consequence is mental and physical lassitude
and low vitality. For this reason, the dwellers in cities are far less exposed
to acute, and especially to inflammatory, affections than rural populations,
who live in a free, normal atmosphere; but they suffer the more from chronic
affections. And if life in large cities is, in itself, injurious to health, how
great must be the harmful influence of an abnormal atmosphere in the
working-people's quarters, where, as we have seen, everything combines to
poison the air. In the country, it may, perhaps, be comparatively innoxious to
keep a dung-heap adjoining one's dwelling, because the air has free ingress
from all sides; but in the midst of a large town, among closely built lanes and
courts that shut out all movement of the atmosphere, the case is different. All
putrefying vegetable and animal substances give off gases decidedly injurious
to health, and if these gases have no free way of escape, they inevitably
poison the atmosphere. The filth and stagnant pools of the working-people's
quarters in the great cities have, therefore, the worst effect upon the public
health, because they produce precisely those gases which engender disease; so,
too, the exhalations from contaminated streams. But this is by no means all.
The manner in which the great multitude of the poor is treated by society today
is revolting. They are drawn into the large cities where they breathe a poorer
atmosphere than in the country; they are relegated to districts which, by
reason of the method of construction, are worse ventilated than any others;
they are deprived of all means of cleanliness, of water itself, since pipes are
laid only when paid for, and the rivers so polluted that they are useless for
such purposes; they are obliged to throw all offal and garbage, all dirty
water, often all disgusting drainage and excrement into the streets, being
without other means of disposing of them; they are thus compelled to infect the
region of their own dwellings. Nor is this enough. All conceivable evils are
heaped upon the heads of the poor. If the population of great cities is too
dense in general, it is they in particular who are packed into the least space.
As though the vitiated atmosphere of the streets were not enough, they are
penned in dozens into single rooms, so that the air which they breathe at night
is enough in itself to stifle them. They are given damp dwellings, cellar dens
that are not waterproof from below or garrets that leak from above. Their
houses are so built that the clammy air cannot escape. They are supplied bad,
tattered, or rotten clothing, adulterated and indigestible food. They are
exposed to the most exciting changes of mental condition, the most violent
vibrations between hope and fear; they are hunted like game, and not permitted
to attain peace of mind and quiet enjoyment of life. They are deprived of all
enjoyments except that of sexual indulgence and drunkenness, are worked every
day to the point of complete exhaustion of their mental and physical energies,
and are thus constantly spurred on to the maddest excess in the only two
enjoyments at their command. And if they surmount all this, they fall victims
to want of work in a crisis when all the little is taken from them that had
hitherto been vouchsafed them. </p>
<p>How is it possible, under such conditions, for the lower class to be healthy
and long lived? What else can be expected than an excessive mortality, an
unbroken series of epidemics, a progressive deterioration in the physique of
the working population? Let us see how the facts stand. </p>
<p>That the dwellings of the workers in the worst portions of the cities,
together with the other conditions of life of this class, engender numerous
diseases, is attested on all sides. The article already quoted from the
<i>Artisan </i>asserts with perfect truth, that lung diseases must be the
inevitable consequence of such conditions, and that, indeed, cases of this kind
are disproportionately frequent in this class. That the bad air of London, and
especially of the working-people's districts, is in the highest degree
favourable to the development of consumption, the hectic appearance of great
numbers of persons sufficiently indicates. If one roams the streets a little in
the early morning, when the multitudes are on their way to their work, one is
amazed at the number of persons who look wholly or half-consumptive. Even in
Manchester the people have not the same appearance; these pale, lank, narrow-
chested, hollow-eyed ghosts, whom one passes at every step, these languid,
flabby faces, incapable of the slightest energetic expression, I have seen in
such startling numbers only in London, though consumption carries off a horde
of victims annually in the factory towns of the North. In competition with
consumption stands typhus, to say nothing of scarlet fever, a disease which
brings most frightful devastation into the ranks of the working- class. Typhus,
that universally diffused affliction, is attributed by the official report on
the sanitary condition of the working- class, directly to the bad state of the
dwellings in the matters of ventilation, drainage, and cleanliness. This report
compiled, it must not be forgotten, by the leading physicians of England from
the testimony of other physicians, asserts that a single ill-ventilated court,
a single blind alley without drainage, is enough to engender fever, and usually
does engender it especially if the inhabitants are greatly crowded. This fever
has the same character almost everywhere, and develops in nearly every case
into specific typhus. It is to be found in the working-people's quarters of all
great towns and cities, and in single ill-built, ill-kept streets of smaller
places, though it naturally seeks out single victims in better districts also.
In London it has now prevailed for a considerable time; its extraordinary
violence in the year 1837 gave rise to the report already referred to.
According to the annual report of Dr. <i>Southwood Smith</i> on the London
Fever Hospital, the number of patients in 1843 was 1,462, or 418 more than in
any previous year. In the damp, dirty regions of the north, south, and east
districts of London, this disease raged with extraordinary violence. Many of
the patients were working-people from the country, who had endured the severest
privation while migrating, and, after their arrival, had slept hungry and
half-naked in the streets, and so fallen victims to the fever. These people
were brought into the hospital in such a state of weakness, that unusual
quantities of wine, cognac, and preparations of ammonia and other stimulants
were required for their treatment; 16½ per cent of all patients died. This
malignant fever is to be found in Manchester; in the worst quarters of the Old
Town, Ancoats, Little Ireland, etc., it is rarely extinct; though here, as in
the English towns generally, it prevails to a less extent than might be
expected. In Scotland and Ireland, on the other hand, it rages with a violence
that surpasses all conception. In Edinburgh and Glasgow it broke out in 1817,
after the famine, and in 1826 and 1837 with especial violence, after the
commercial crisis, subsiding somewhat each time after having raged about three
years. In Edinburgh about 6,000 persons were attacked by the fever during the
epidemic of 1817, and about 10,000 in that of 1837, and not only the number of
persons attacked but the violence of the disease increased with each
repetition. <a href="#2" id="[2]"></a><a href="#2" id="[2]"><sup class="enote">[2]</sup></a> </p>
<p>But the fury of the epidemic in all former periods seems to have been
child's play in comparison with its ravages after the crisis of 1842. One-sixth
of the whole indigent population of Scotland was seized by the fever, and the
infection was carried by wandering beggars with fearful rapidity from one
locality to another. It did not reach the middle and upper classes of the
population, yet in two months there were more fever cases than in twelve years
before. In Glasgow, twelve per cent of the population were seized in the year
1843; 52,000 persons, of whom thirty-two per cent perished, while this
mortality in Manchester and Liverpool does not ordinarily exceed eight per
cent. The illness reached a crisis on the seventh and fifteenth days; on the
latter, the patient usually became yellow, which our authority regards as an
indication that the cause of the malady was to be sought in mental excitement
and anxiety. <a href="#3" id="[3]"></a><a href="#3" id="[3]"><sup class="enote">[3]</sup></a> In Ireland, too, these fever epidemics have become
domesticated. During twenty-one months of the years 1817-1818, 39,000 fever
patients passed through the Dublin hospital; and in a more recent year,
according to Sheriff Alison, 60,000. <a href="#4" id="[4]"></a><a href="#4" id="[4]"><sup class="enote">[4]</sup></a> In Cork the fever hospital received
one-seventh of the population in 1817-1818, in Limerick in the same time
one-fourth, and in the bad quarter of Waterford, nineteen- twentieths of the
whole population were ill of the fever at one time. <a href="#5" id="[5]"></a><a href="#5" id="[5]"><sup class="enote">[5]</sup></a> </p>
<p>When one remembers under what conditions the working- people live, when one
thinks how crowded their dwellings are, how every nook and corner swarms with
human beings, how sick and well sleep in the same room, in the same bed, the
only wonder is that a contagious disease like this fever does not spread yet
farther. And when one reflects how little medical assistance the sick have at
command, how many are without any medical advice whatsoever, and ignorant of
the most ordinary precautionary measures, the mortality seems actually small.
Dr. Alison, who has made a careful study of this disease, attributes it
directly to the want and the wretched condition of the poor, as in the report
already quoted. He asserts that privations and the insufficient satisfaction of
vital needs are what prepare the frame for contagion and make the epidemic
widespread and terrible. He proves that a period of privation, a commercial
crisis or a bad harvest, has each time produced the typhus epidemic in Ireland
as in Scotland, and that the fury of the plague has fallen almost exclusively
on the working-class. It is a noteworthy fact, that according to his testimony,
the majority of persons who perish by typhus are fathers of families, precisely
the persons who can least be spared by those dependent upon them; and several
Irish physicians whom he quotes bear the same testimony. </p>
<p>Another category of diseases arises directly from the food rather than the
dwellings of the workers. The food of the labourer, indigestible enough in
itself, is utterly unfit for young children, and he has neither means nor time
to get his children more suitable food. Moreover, the custom of giving children
spirits, and even opium, is very general; and these two influences, with the
rest of the conditions of life prejudicial to bodily development, give rise to
the most diverse affections of the digestive organs, leaving life-long traces
behind them. Nearly all workers have stomachs more or less weak, and are yet
forced to adhere to the diet which is the root of the evil. How should they
know what is to blame for it? And if they knew, how could they obtain a more
suitable regimen so long as they cannot adopt a different way of living and are
not better educated? But new disease arises during childhood from impaired
digestion. Scrofula is almost universal among the working-class, and scrofulous
parents have scrofulous children, especially when the original influences
continue in full force to operate upon the inherited tendency of the children.
A second consequence of this insufficient bodily nourishment, during the years
of growth and development, is rachitis, which is extremely common among the
children of the working-class. The hardening of the bones is delayed, the
development of the skeleton in general is restricted, and deformities of the
legs and spinal column are frequent, in addition to the usual rachitic
affections. How greatly all these evils are increased by the changes to which
the workers are subject in consequence of fluctuations in trade, want of work,
and the scanty wages in time of crisis, it is not necessary to dwell upon.
Temporary want of sufficient food, to which almost every working-man is exposed
at least once in the course of his life, only contributes to intensify the
effects of his usually sufficient but bad diet. Children who are half-starved,
just when they most need ample and nutritious food – and how many such
there are during every crisis and even when trade is at its best – must
inevitably become weak, scrofulous and rachitic in a high degree. And that they
do become so, their appearance amply shows. The neglect to which the great mass
of working-men's children are condemned leaves ineradicable traces and brings
the enfeeblement of the whole race of workers with it. Add to this the
unsuitable clothing of this class, the impossibility of precautions against
colds, the necessity of toiling so long as health permits, want made more dire
when sickness appears, and the only too common lack of all medical assistance;
and we have a rough idea of the sanitary condition of the English
working-class. The injurious effects peculiar to single employments as now
conducted, I shall not deal with here. </p>
<p>Besides these, there are other influences which enfeeble the health of a
great number of workers, intemperance most of all. All possible temptations,
all allurements combine to bring the workers to drunkenness. Liquor is almost
their only source of pleasure, and all things conspire to make it accessible to
them. The working-man comes from his work tired, exhausted, finds his home
comfortless, damp, dirty, repulsive; he has urgent need of recreation, he must
have something to make work worth his trouble, to make the prospect of the next
day endurable. His unnerved, uncomfortable, hypochondriac state of mind and
body arising from his unhealthy condition, and especially from indigestion, is
aggravated beyond endurance by the general conditions of his life, the
uncertainty of his existence, his dependence upon all possible accidents and
chances, and his inability to do anything towards gaining an assured position.
His enfeebled frame, weakened by bad air and bad food, violently demands some
external stimulus; his social need can be gratified only in the public-house,
he has absolutely no other place where he can meet his friends. How can he be
expected to resist the temptation? It is morally and physically inevitable
that, under such circumstances, a very large number of working-men should fall
into intemperance. And apart from the chiefly physical influences which drive
the working-man into drunkenness, there is the example of the great mass, the
neglected education, the impossibility of protecting the young from temptation,
in many cases the direct influence of intemperate parents, who give their own
children liquor, the certainty of forgetting for an hour or two the
wretchedness and burden of life, and a hundred other circumstances so mighty
that the workers can, in truth, hardly be blamed for yielding to such
overwhelming pressure. Drunkenness has here ceased to be a vice, for which the
vicious can be held responsible; it becomes a phenomenon, the necessary,
inevitable effect of certain conditions upon an object possessed of no volition
in relation to those conditions. They who have degraded the working-man to a
mere object have the responsibility to bear. But as inevitably as a great
number of working-men fall a prey to drink, just so inevitably does it manifest
its ruinous influence upon the body and mind of its victims. All the tendencies
to disease arising from the conditions of life of the workers are promoted by
it, it stimulates in the highest degree the development of lung and digestive
troubles, the rise and spread of typhus epidemics. </p>
<p>Another source of physical mischief to the working-class lies in the
impossibility of employing skilled physicians in cases of illness. It is true
that a number of charitable institutions strive to supply this want, that the
infirmary in Manchester, for instance, receives or gives advice and medicine to
22,000 patients annually. But what is that in a city in which, according to
Gaskell's calculation, <a href="#6" id="[6]"></a><a href="#6" id="[6]"><sup class="enote">[6]</sup></a> three-fourths of the population need medical aid
every year? English doctors charge high fees, and working-men are not in a
position to pay them. They can therefore do nothing, or are compelled to call
in cheap charlatans, and use quack remedies, which do more harm than good. An
immense number of such quacks thrive in every English town, securing their
clientele among the poor by means of advertisements, posters, and other such
devices. Besides these, vast quantities of patent medicines are sold, for all
conceivable ailments: Morrison's Pills, Parr's Life Pills, Dr. Mainwaring's
Pills, and a thousand other pills, essences, and balsams, all of which have the
property of curing all the ills that flesh is heir to. These medicines rarely
contain actually injurious substances, but, when taken freely and often, they
affect the system prejudicially; and as the unwary purchasers are always
recommended to take as much as possible, it is not to be wondered at that they
swallow them wholesale whether wanted or not. </p>
<p>It is by no means unusual for the manufacturer of Parr's Life Pills to sell
twenty to twenty-five thousand boxes of these salutary pills in a week, and
they are taken for constipation by this one, for diarrhoea by that one, for
fever, weakness, and all possible ailments. As our German peasants are cupped
or bled at certain seasons, so do the English working-people now consume patent
medicines to their own injury and the great profit of the manufacturer. One of
the most injurious of these patent medicines is a drink prepared with opiates,
chiefly laudanum, under the name Godfrey's Cordial. Women who work at home, and
have their own and other people's children to take care of, give them this
drink to keep them quiet, and, as many believe, to strengthen them. They often
begin to give this medicine to newly born children, and continue, without
knowing the effects of this "heart's-ease", until the children die. The less
susceptible the child's system to the action of the opium, the greater the
quantities administered. When the cordial ceases to act, laudanum alone is
given, often to the extent of fifteen to twenty drops at a dose. The Coroner of
Nottingham testified before a Parliamentary Commission <a href="#7" id="[7]"></a><a href="#7" id="[7]"><sup class="enote">[7]</sup></a> that one
apothecary had, according to his own statement, used thirteen hundredweight of
treacle in one year in the preparation of Godfrey's Cordial. The effects upon
the children so treated may be readily imagined. They are pale, feeble, wilted,
and usually die before completing the second year. The use of this cordial is
very extensive in all great towns and industrial districts in the kingdom. </p>
<p>The result of all these influences is a general enfeeblement of the frame in
the working-class. There are few vigorous, well-built, healthy persons among
the workers, i.e. among the factory operatives, who are employed in confined
rooms, and we are here discussing these only. They are almost all weakly, of
angular but not powerful build, lean, pale, and of relaxed fibre, with the
exception of the muscles especially exercised in their work. Nearly all suffer
from indigestion, and consequently from a more or less hypochondriac,
melancholy, irritable, nervous condition. Their enfeebled constitutions are
unable to resist disease, and are therefore seized by it on every occasion.
Hence they age prematurely, and die early. On this point the mortality
statistics supply unquestionable testimony. </p>
<p>According to the Report of Registrar-General Graham, the annual death-rate
of all England and Wales is something less than 2 1/2 per cent. That is to say,
out of forty-five persons, one dies every year. <a href="#8" id="[8]"></a><a href="#8" id="[8]"><sup class="enote">[8]</sup></a> This was the average for
the year 1839-40. In 1840-41 the mortality diminished somewhat, and the
death-rate was but one in forty-six. But in the great cities the proportion is
wholly different. I have before me official tables of mortality (<i>Manchester
Guardian</i>, July 31st, 1844), according to which the death-rate of several
large towns is as follows: – In Manchester, including Chorlton and
Salford, one in 32.72; and excluding Chorlton and Salford, one in 50.75. In
Liverpool, including West Derby (suburb), 31.90, and excluding West Derby,
29.90; while the average of all the districts of Cheshire, Lancashire, and
Yorkshire cited, including a number of wholly or partially rural districts and
many small towns, with a total population of 2,172,506 for the whole, is one
death in 39.80 persons. How unfavourably the workers are placed in the great
cities, the mortality for Prescott in Lancashire shows: a district inhabited by
miners, and showing a lower sanitary condition than that of the agricultural
districts, mining being by no means a healthful occupation. But these miners
live in the country, and the death-rate among them is but one in 47.54, or
nearly two-and-a-half per cent better than that for all England. All these
statements are based upon the mortality tables for 1843. Still higher is the
death-rate in the Scotch cities; in Edinburgh, in 1838-39, one in 29; in 1831,
in the Old Town alone, one in 22. In Glasgow, according to Dr. Cowan, <a href="#9" id="[9]"></a><a href="#9" id="[9]"><sup class="enote">[9]</sup></a> the average has been, since 1830, one in 90; and in
single years, one in 22 to 24. That this enormous shortening of life falls
chiefly upon the working-class, that the general average is improved by the
smaller mortality of the upper and middle-classes, is attested upon all sides.
One of the most recent depositions is that of a physician, Dr. P. H. Holland in
Manchester, who investigated Chorlton-on-Medlock, a suburb of Manchester, under
official commission. He divided the houses and streets into three classes each,
and ascertained the following variations in the death-rate:</p>

</table>
<p>It is clear from other tables given by Holland that the mortality in the
<i>streets </i>of the second class is 18 per cent greater, and in the streets
of the third class 68 per cent greater than in those of the first class; that
the mortality in the <i>houses </i>of the second class is 31 per cent
greater, and in the third class 78 per cent greater than in those of the first
class; that the mortality in those bad streets which were improved, decreased
25 per cent. He closes with the remark, very frank for an English bourgeois: <a href="#10" id="[10]"></a><a href="#10" id="[10]"><sup class="enote">[10]</sup></a> </p>
<p class="indentb">"When we find the rate of mortality four times as high in
some streets as in others, and twice as high in whole classes of streets as in
other classes, and further find that it is all but invariably high in those
streets which are in bad condition, and almost invariably low in those whose
condition is good, we cannot resist the conclusion that multitudes of our
fellow-creatures, hundreds of our immediate neighbours, are annually destroyed
for want of the most evident precautions."</p>
<p class="fst">The Report on the Sanitary Condition of the Working-Class
contains information which attests the same fact. In Liverpool, in 1840, the
average longevity of the upper classes, gentry, professional men, etc., was
thirty-five years; that of the business men and better-placed handicraftsmen,
twenty-two years; and that of the operatives, day-labourers, and serviceable
class in general, but fifteen years. The Parliamentary reports contain a mass
of similar facts. </p>
<p>The death-rate is kept so high chiefly by the heavy mortality among young
children in the working-class. The tender frame of a child is least able to
withstand the unfavourable influences of an inferior lot in life; the neglect
to which they are often subjected, when both parents work or one is dead,
avenges itself promptly, and no one need wonder that in Manchester, according
to the report last quoted, more than fifty-seven per cent of the children of
the working-class perish before the fifth year, while but twenty per cent of
the children of the higher classes, and not quite. thirty-two per cent of the
children of all classes in the country die under five years of age. <a href="#11" id="[11]"></a><a href="#11" id="[11]"><sup class="enote">[11]</sup></a> The article of the <i>Artisan</i>, already
several times referred to, furnishes exacter information on this point, by
comparing the city death-rate in single diseases of children with the country
death-rate, thus demonstrating that, in general, epidemics in Manchester and
Liverpool are three times more fatal than in country districts; that affections
of the nervous system are quintupled, and stomach troubles trebled, while
deaths from affections of the lungs in cities are to those in the country as 2
1/2 to 1. Fatal cases of small-pox, measles, scarlet fever, and whooping cough,
among small children, are four times more frequent; those of water on the brain
are trebled, and convulsions ten times more frequent. To quote another
acknowledged authority, I append the following table. Out of 10,000 persons
there die – <a href="#12" id="[12]"></a><a href="#12" id="[12]"><sup class="enote">[12]</sup></a> </p>

<p>Apart from the diverse diseases which are the necessary consequence of the
present neglect and oppression of the poorer classes, there are other
influences which contribute to increase the mortality among small children. In
many families the wife, like the husband, has to work away from home, and the
consequence is the total neglect of the children, who are either locked up or
given out to be taken care of. It is, therefore, not to be wondered at if
hundreds of them perish through all manner of accidents. Nowhere are so many
children run over, nowhere are so many killed by falling, drowning, or burning,
as in the great cities and towns of England. Deaths from burns and scalds are
especially frequent, such a case occurring nearly every week during the winter
months in Manchester, and very frequently in London, though little mention is
made of them in the papers. I have at hand a copy of the <i>Weekly
Dispatch</i> of December 15th, 1844, according to which, in the week from
December 1st to December 7th inclusive, six such cases occurred. These unhappy
children, perishing in this terrible way, are victims of our social disorder,
and of the property-holding classes interested in maintaining and prolonging
this disorder. Yet one is left in doubt whether even this terribly torturing
death is not a blessing for the children in rescuing them from a long life of
toil and wretchedness, rich in suffering and poor in enjoyment. So far has it
gone in England; and the bourgeoisie reads these things every day in the
newspapers and takes no further trouble in the matter. But it cannot complain
if, after the official and non-official testimony here cited which must be
known to it, I broadly accuse it of social murder. Let the ruling class see to
it that these frightful conditions are ameliorated, or let it surrender the
administration of the common interests to the labouring-class. To the latter
course it is by no means inclined; for the former task, so long as it remains
the bourgeoisie crippled by bourgeois prejudice, it has not the needed power.
For if, at last, after hundreds of thousands of victims have perished, it
manifests some little anxiety for the future, passing a "Metropolitan Buildings
Act", under which the most unscrupulous overcrowding of dwellings is to be, at
least in some slight degree, restricted; if it points with pride to measures
which, far from attacking the root of the evil, do not by any means meet the
demands of the commonest sanitary police, it cannot thus vindicate itself from
the accusation. The English bourgeoisie has but one choice, either to continue
its rule under the unanswerable charge of murder and in spite of this charge,
or to abdicate in favour of the labouring-class. Hitherto it has chosen the
former course. </p>
<p>Let us turn from the physical to the mental state of the workers. Since the
bourgeoisie vouchsafes them only so much of life as is absolutely necessary, we
need not wonder that it bestows upon them only so much education as lies in the
interest of the bourgeoisie; and that, in truth, is not much. The means of
education in England are restricted out of all proportion to the population.
The few day schools at the command of the working-class are available only for
the smallest minority, and are bad besides. The teachers, worn-out workers, and
other unsuitable persons who only turn to teaching in order to live, are
usually without the indispensable elementary knowledge, without the moral
discipline so needful for the teacher, and relieved of all public supervision.
Here, too, free competition rules, and, as usual, the rich profit by it, and
the poor, for whom competition is not free, who have not the knowledge needed
to enable them to form a correct judgment, have the evil consequences to bear.
Compulsory school attendance does not exist. In the mills it is, as we shall
see, purely nominal; and when in the session of 1843 the Ministry was disposed
to make this nominal compulsion effective, the manufacturing bourgeoisie
opposed the measure with all its might, though the working-class was
outspokenly in favour of compulsory school attendance. Moreover, a mass of
children work the whole week through in the mills or at home, and therefore
cannot attend school. The evening schools, supposed to be attended by children
who are employed during the day, are almost abandoned or attended without
benefit. It is asking too much, that young workers, who have been using
themselves up twelve hours in the day, should go to school from eight to ten at
night. And those who try it usually fall asleep, as is testified by hundreds of
witnesses in the Children's Employment Commission's Report. Sunday schools have
been founded, it is true, but they, too, are most scantily supplied with
teachers, and can be of use to those only who have already learnt something in
the day schools. The interval from one Sunday to the next is too long for an
ignorant child to remember in the second sitting what it learned in the first,
a week before. The Children's Employment Commission's Report furnishes a
hundred proofs, and the Commission itself most emphatically expresses the
opinion, that neither the week-day nor the Sunday schools, in the least degree,
meet the needs of the nation. This Report gives evidence of ignorance in the
working-class of England, such as could hardly be expected in Spain or Italy.
It cannot be otherwise; the bourgeoisie has little to hope, and much to fear,
from the education of the working-class. The Ministry, in its whole enormous
budget of £55,000,000, has only the single trifling item of £40,000 for public
education, and, but for the fanaticism of the religious sects which does at
least as much harm as good, the means of education would be yet more scanty. As
it is, the State Church manages its national schools and the various sects
their sectarian schools for the sole purpose of keeping the children of the
brethren of the faith within the congregation, and of winning away a poor
childish soul here and there from some other sect. The consequence is that
religion, and precisely the most unprofitable side of religion, polemical
discussion, is made the principal subject of instruction, and the memory of the
children overburdened with incomprehensible dogmas and theological
distinctions; that sectarian hatred and bigotry are awakened as early as
possible, and all rational mental and moral training shamefully neglected. The
working-class has repeatedly demanded of Parliament a system of strictly
secular public education, leaving religion to the ministers of the sects; but,
thus far, no Ministry has been induced to grant it. The Minister is the
obedient servant of the bourgeoisie, and the bourgeoisie is divided into
countless sects; but each would gladly grant the workers the otherwise
dangerous education on the sole condition of their accepting, as an antidote,
the dogmas peculiar to the especial sect in question. And as these sects are
still quarrelling among themselves for supremacy, the workers remain for the
present without education. It is true that the manufacturers boast of having
enabled the majority to read, but the quality of the reading is appropriate to
the source of the instruction, as the Children's Employment Commission proves.
According to this report, he who knows his letters can read enough to satisfy
the conscience of the manufacturers. And when one reflects upon the confused
orthography of the English language which makes reading one of the arts,
learned only under long instruction, this ignorance is readily understood. Very
few working-people write readily; and writing orthographically is beyond the
powers even of many "educated" persons. The Sunday schools of the State Church,
of the Quakers, and, I think, of several other sects, do not teach writing,
"because it is too worldly an employment for Sunday". The quality of the
instruction offered the workers in other directions may be judged from a
specimen or two, taken from the Children's Employment Commission's Report,
which unfortunately does not embrace mill-work proper: </p>
<p class="indentb">In Birmingham, says Commissioner Grainger, the children
examined by me are, as a whole, utterly wanting in all that could be in the
remotest degree called a useful education. Although in almost all the schools
religious instruction alone is furnished, the profoundest ignorance even upon
that subject prevailed.– In Wolverhampton, says Commissioner Horne, I
found, among others, the following example: A girl of eleven years who had
attended both day and Sunday school "had never learnt of another world, nor of
heaven, nor of another life". A boy, seventeen years old, "did not know how
many two and two made, nor how many farthings there were in twopence, even when
the money was placed in his hand". Several boys had never heard of London nor
of Willenhall, though the latter was but an hour's walk from their homes, and
in the closest relations with Wolverhampton. Several had never heard the name
of the Queen nor other names, such as Nelson, Wellington, Bonaparte; but it was
noteworthy that those who had never heard even of St. Paul, Moses, or Solomon,
were very well instructed as to the life, deeds, and character of Dick Turpin,
and especially of Jack Sheppard. A youth of sixteen did not know "how many
twice two make", nor "how much money four farthings make". A youth of seventeen
asserted that "ten farthings make ten halfpence"; a third, seventeen years old,
answered several very simple questions with the brief statement, that "he was
ne jedge o' nothin'." <a href="#13" id="[13]"></a><a href="#13" id="[13]"><sup class="enote">[13]</sup></a> These children, who are crammed
with religious doctrines for four or five years at a stretch, know as little at
the end as at the beginning. One child had "attended a Sunday school regularly
for five years; does not know who Jesus Christ was, but has heard the name.
Never heard of the twelve apostles. Never heard of Samson, nor of Moses, nor
Aaron, etc." <a href="#14" id="[14]"></a><a href="#14" id="[14]"><sup class="enote">[14]</sup></a> Another "attended a Sunday school regularly six
years. Knows who Jesus Christ was, he died on the cross to shed his blood, to
save our Saviour. Never heard of St. Peter or St. Paul."<a href="#15" id="[15]"></a><a href="#15" id="[15]"><sup class="enote">[15]</sup></a> A
third, "attended the Sunday schools of different kinds about seven years; can
read, only in the thin books, easy words of one syllable; has heard of the
apostles, does not know if St. Peter was one, nor if St. John was one, unless
it was St. John Wesley."<a href="#16" id="[16]"></a><a href="#16" id="[16]"><sup class="enote">[16]</sup></a> To the question who Christ was,
Horne received, among others, the following answers, "Yes, Adam," "He was an
apostle," "He was the Saviour's Lord's Son," and from a youth of sixteen:
"Jesus Christ was a king of London a long time ago." In Sheffield, Commissioner
Symons let the children from the Sunday school read aloud; they could not tell
what they had read, or what sort of people the apostles were, of whom they had
just been reading. After he had asked them all one after the other about the
apostles without securing a single correct answer, one sly-looking little
fellow, with great glee, called out: "Please sir, they were the lepers!" <a href="#17" id="[17]"></a><a href="#17" id="[17]"><sup class="enote">[17]</sup></a> From the pottery districts and from Lancashire the
reports are similar.</p>
<p class="fst">This is what the bourgeoisie and the State are doing for the
education and improvement of the working-class. Fortunately the conditions
under which this class lives are such as give it a sort of practical training,
which not only replaces school cramming, but renders harmless the confused
religious notions connected with it, and even places the workers in the
vanguard of the national movement of England. Necessity is the mother of
invention, and what is still more important, of thought and action. The English
working-man who can scarcely read and still less write, nevertheless knows very
well where his own interest and that of the nation lies. He knows, too, what
the especial interest of the bourgeoisie is, and what he has to expect of that
bourgeoisie. If he cannot write he can speak, and speak in public; if he has no
arithmetic, he can, nevertheless, reckon with the Political Economists enough
to see through a Corn-Law-repealing bourgeois, and to get the better of him in
argument; if celestial matters remain very mixed for him in spite of all the
effort of the preachers, he sees all the more clearly into terrestrial,
political, and social questions. We shall have occasion to refer again to this
point; and pass now to the moral characteristics of our workers. </p>
<p>It is sufficiently clear that the instruction in morals can have no better
effect than the religious teaching, with which in all English schools it is
mixed up. The simple principles which, for plain human beings, regulate the
relations of man to man, brought into the direst confusion by our social state,
our war of each against all, necessarily remain confused and foreign to the
working-man when mixed with incomprehensible dogmas, and preached in the
religious form of an arbitrary and dogmatic commandment. The schools
contribute, according to the confession of all authorities, and especially of
the Children's Employment Commission, almost nothing to the morality of the
working-class. So short-sighted, so stupidly narrow-minded is the English
bourgeoisie in its egotism, that it does not even take the trouble to impress
upon the workers the morality of the day, which the bourgeoisie has patched
together in its own interest for its own protection! Even this precautionary
measure is too great an effort for the enfeebled and sluggish bourgeoisie. A
time must come when it will repent its neglect, too late. But it has no right
to complain that the workers know nothing of its system of morals, and do not
act in accordance with it. </p>
<p>Thus are the workers cast out and ignored by the class in power, morally as
well as physically and mentally. The only provision made for them is the law,
which fastens upon them when they become obnoxious to the bourgeoisie. Like the
dullest of the brutes, they are treated to but one form of education, the whip,
in the shape of force, not convincing but intimidating. There is, therefore, no
cause for surprise if the workers, treated as brutes, actually become such; or
if they can maintain their consciousness of manhood only by cherishing the most
glowing hatred, the most unbroken inward rebellion against the bourgeoisie in
power. They are men so long only as they burn with wrath against the reigning
class. They become brutes the moment they bend in patience under the yoke, and
merely strive to make life endurable while abandoning the effort to break the
yoke. </p>
<p>This, then, is all that the bourgeoisie has done for the education of the
proletariat – and when we take into consideration all the circumstances
in which this class lives, we shall not think the worse of it for the
resentment which it cherishes against the ruling class. The moral training
which is not given to the worker in school is not supplied by the other
conditions of his life; that moral training, at least, which alone has worth in
the eyes of the bourgeoisie; his whole position and environment involves the
strongest temptation to immorality. He is poor, life offers him no charm,
almost every enjoyment is denied him, the penalties of the law have no further
terrors for him; why should he restrain his desires, why leave to the rich the
enjoyment of his birthright, why not seize a part of it for himself? What
inducement has the proletarian not to steal? It is all very pretty and very
agreeable to the ear of the bourgeois to hear the "sacredness of property"
asserted; but for him who has none, the sacredness of property dies out of
itself. Money is the God of this world; the bourgeois takes the proletarian's
money from him and so makes a practical atheist of him. No wonder, then, if the
proletarian retains his atheism and no longer respects the sacredness and power
of the earthly God. And when the poverty of the proletarian is intensified to
the point of actual lack of the barest necessaries of life, to want and hunger,
the temptation to disregard all social order does but gain power. This the
bourgeoisie for the most part recognises. Symons <a href="#18" id="[18]"></a><a href="#18" id="[18]"><sup class="enote">[18]</sup></a>
observes that poverty exercises the same ruinous influence upon the mind which
drunkenness exercises upon the body; and Dr. Alison explains to
property-holding readers, with the greatest exactness, what the consequences of
social oppression must be for the working-class.<a href="#19" id="[19]"></a><a href="#19" id="[19]"><sup class="enote">[19]</sup></a> Want
leaves the working-man the choice between starving slowly, killing himself
speedily, or taking what he needs where he finds it – in plain English,
stealing. And there is no cause for surprise that most of them prefer stealing
to starvation and suicide. </p>
<p>True, there are, within the working-class, numbers too moral to steal even
when reduced to the utmost extremity, and these starve or commit suicide. For
suicide, formerly the enviable privilege of the upper classes, has become
fashionable among the English workers, and numbers of the poor kill themselves
to avoid the misery from which they see no other means of escape. </p>
<p>But far more demoralising than his poverty in its influence upon the English
working-man is the insecurity of his position, the necessity of living upon
wages from hand to mouth, that in short which makes a proletarian of him. The
smaller peasants in Germany are usually poor, and often suffer want, but they
are less at the mercy of accident, they have at least something secure. The
proletarian, who has nothing but his two hands, who consumes today what he
earned yesterday, who is subject to every possible chance, and has not the
slightest guarantee for being able to earn the barest necessities of life, whom
every crisis, every whim of his employer may deprive of bread, this proletarian
is placed in the most revolting, inhuman position conceivable for a human
being. The slave is assured of a bare livelihood by the self-interest of his
master, the serf has at least a scrap of land on which to live; each has at
worst a guarantee for life itself. But the proletarian must depend upon himself
alone, and is yet prevented from so applying his abilities as to be able to
rely upon them. Everything that the proletarian can do to improve his position
is but a drop in the ocean compared with the floods of varying chances to which
he is exposed, over which he has not the slightest control. He is the passive
subject of all possible combinations of circumstances, and must count himself
fortunate when he has saved his life even for a short time; and his character
and way of living are naturally shaped by these conditions. Either he seeks to
keep his head above water in this whirlpool, to rescue his manhood, and this he
can do solely in rebellion<a href="#20" id="[20]"><sup class="enote">[20]</sup></a> against the class which plunders him so
mercilessly and then abandons him to his fate, which strives to hold him in
this position so demoralising to a human being; or he gives up the struggle
against his fate as hopeless, and strives to profit, so far as he can, by the
most favourable moment. To save is unavailing, for at the utmost he cannot save
more than suffices to sustain life for a short time, while if he falls out of
work, it is for no brief period. To accumulate lasting property for himself is
impossible; and if it were not, he would only cease to be a working-man and
another would take his place. What better thing can he do, then, when he gets
high wages, than live well upon them? The English bourgeoisie is violently
scandalised at the extravagant living of the workers when wages are high; yet
it is not only very natural but very sensible of them to enjoy life when they
can, instead of laying up treasures which are of no lasting use to them, and
which in the end moth and rust (i.e., the bourgeoisie) get possession of. Yet
such a life is demoralising beyond all others. What Carlyle says of the cotton
spinners is true of all English industrial workers:<a href="#21" id="[21]"></a><a href="#21" id="[21]"><sup class="enote">[21]</sup></a> </p>
<p class="indentb">"Their trade, now in plethoric prosperity, anon extenuated
into inanition and 'short time', is of the nature of gambling; they live by it
like gamblers, now in luxurious superfluity, now in starvation. Black, mutinous
discontent devours them; simply the miserablest feeling that can inhabit the
heart of man. English commerce, with its world-wide, convulsive fluctuations,
with its immeasurable Proteus Steam demon, makes all paths uncertain for them,
all life a bewilderment; sobriety, steadfastness, peaceable continuance, the
first blessings of man are not theirs.– This world is for them no home,
but a dingy prison-house, of reckless unthrift, rebellion, rancour, indignation
against themselves and against all men. Is it a green, flowery world, with
azure everlasting sky stretched over it, the work and government of a God; or a
murky, simmering Tophet, of copperas fumes, cotton fuzz, gin riot, wrath and
toil, created by a Demon, governed by a Demon?"</p>
<p class="fst">And elsewhere: <a href="#22" id="[22]"></a><a href="#22" id="[22]"><sup class="enote">[22]</sup></a> </p>
<p class="indentb">"Injustice, infidelity to truth and fact and Nature's order,
being properly the one evil under the sun, and the feeling of injustice the one
intolerable pain under the sun, our grand question as to the condition of these
working-men would be: Is it just? And, first of all, what belief have they
themselves formed about the justice of it? The words they promulgate are
notable by way of answer; their actions are still more notable. Revolt, sullen,
revengeful humour of revolt against the upper classes, decreasing respect for
what their temporal superiors command, decreasing faith for what their
spiritual superiors teach, is more and more the universal spirit of the lower
classes. Such spirit may be blamed, may be vindicated, but all men must
recognise it as extant there, all may know that it is mournful, that unless
altered it will be fatal."</p>
<p class="fst">Carlyle is perfectly right as to the facts and wrong only in
censuring the wild rage of the workers against the higher classes. This rage,
this passion, is rather the proof that the workers feel the inhumanity of their
position, that they refuse to be degraded to the level of brutes, and that they
will one day free themselves from servitude to the bourgeoisie. This may be
seen in the case of those who do not share this wrath; they either bow humbly
before the fate that overtakes them, live a respectful private life as well as
they can, do not concern themselves as to the course of public affairs, help
the bourgeoisie to forge the chains of the workers yet more securely and stand
upon the plane of intellectual nullity that prevailed before the industrial
period began; or they are tossed about by fate, lose their moral hold upon
themselves as they have already lost their economic hold, live along from day
to day, drink and fall into licentiousness; and in both cases they are brutes.
The last-named class contributes chiefly to the "rapid increase of vice", at
which the bourgeoisie' is so horrified after itself setting in motion the
causes which give rise to it. </p>
<p>Another source of demoralisation among the workers is their being condemned
to work. As voluntary, productive activity is the highest enjoyment known to
us, so is compulsory toil the most cruel, degrading punishment. Nothing is more
terrible than being constrained to do some one thing every day from morning
until night against one's will. And the more a man the worker feels himself,
the more hateful must his work be to him, because he feels the constraint, the
aimlessness of it for himself. Why does he work? For love of work? From a
natural impulse? Not at all! He works for money, for a thing which has nothing
whatsoever to do with the work itself; and he works so long, moreover, and in
such unbroken monotony, that this alone must make his work a torture in the
first weeks if he has the least human feeling left. The division of labour has
multiplied the brutalising influences of forced work. In most branches the
worker's activity is reduced to some paltry, purely mechanical manipulation,
repeated minute after minute, unchanged year after year.<a href="#23" id="[23]"></a><a href="#23" id="[23]"><sup class="enote">[23]</sup></a> How
much human feeling, what abilities can a man retain in his thirtieth year, who
has made needle points or filed toothed wheels twelve hours every day from his
early childhood, living all the time under the conditions forced upon the
English proletarian? It is still the same thing since the introduction of
steam. The worker's activity is made easy, muscular effort is saved, but the
work itself becomes unmeaning and monotonous to the last degree. It offers no
field for mental activity, and claims just enough of his attention to keep him
from thinking of anything else. And a sentence to such work, to work which
takes his whole time for itself, leaving him scarcely time to eat and sleep,
none for physical exercise in the open air, or the enjoyment of Nature, much
less for mental activity, how can such a sentence help degrading a human being
to the level of a brute? Once more the worker must choose, must either
surrender himself to his fate, become a "good" workman, heed "faithfully" the
interest of the bourgeoisie, in which case he most certainly becomes a brute,
or else he must rebel, fight for his manhood to the last, and this he can only
do in the fight against the bourgeoisie. </p>
<p>And when all these conditions have engendered vast demoralisation among the
workers, a new influence is added to the old, to spread this degradation more
widely and carry it to the extremest point. This influence is the
centralisation of the population. The writers of the English bourgeoisie are
crying murder at the demoralising tendency of the great cities; like perverted
Jeremiahs, they sing dirges, not over the destruction, but the growth of the
cities. Sheriff Alison attributes almost everything, and Dr. Vaughan, author of
<i>The Age of Great Cities, </i>still more to this influence. And this is
natural, for the propertied class has too direct an interest in the other
conditions which tend to destroy the worker body and soul. If they should admit
that poverty, insecurity, overwork, forced work, are the chief ruinous
influences, they would have to draw the conclusion, then let us give the poor
property, guarantee their subsistence, make laws against overwork, and this the
bourgeoisie dare not formulate. But the great cities have grown up so
spontaneously, the population has moved into them so wholly of its own motion,
and the inference that manufacture and the middle-class which profits from it
alone have created the cities is so remote, that it is extremely convenient for
the ruling class to ascribe all the evil to this apparently unavoidable source;
whereas the great cities really only secure a more rapid and certain
development for evils already existing in the germ. Alison is humane enough to
admit this; he is no thoroughbred Liberal manufacturer, but only a half
developed Tory bourgeois, and he has, therefore, an open eye, now and then,
where the full-fledged bourgeois is still stone blind. Let us hear him.<a href="#24" id="[24]"></a><a href="#24" id="[24]"><sup class="enote">[24]</sup></a> </p>
<p class="indentb">It is in the great cities that "vice has spread her
temptations, and pleasure her seductions, and folly her allurements; that guilt
is encouraged by the hope of impunity, and idleness fostered by the frequency
of example. It is to these great marts of human corruption that the base and
the profligate resort from the simplicity of country life; it is here that they
find victims whereon to practise their iniquity, and gains to reward the
dangers that attend them. Virtue is here depressed from the obscurity in which
it is involved. Guilt is matured from the difficulty of its detection;
licentiousness is rewarded by the immediate enjoyment which it promises. If any
person will walk through St. Giles's, the crowded alleys of Dublin, or the
poorer quarters of Glasgow by night, he will meet with ample proof of these
observations; he will no longer wonder at the disorderly habits and profligate
enjoyments of the lower orders; his astonishment will be, not that there is so
much, but that there is so little crime in the world. The great cause of human
corruption in these crowded situations is the contagious nature of bad example
and the extreme difficulty of avoiding the seductions of vice when they are
brought into close and daily proximity with the younger part of the people.
Whatever we may think of the strength of virtue, experience proves that the
higher orders are indebted for their exemption from atrocious crime or
disorderly habits chiefly to their fortunate removal from the scene of
temptation; and that where they are exposed to the seductions which assail
their inferiors, they are noways behind them in yielding to their influence. It
is the peculiar misfortune of the poor in great cities that they cannot fly
from these irresistible temptations, but that, turn where they will, they are
met by the alluring forms of vice, or the seductions of guilty enjoyment. It is
the experienced impossibility of concealing the attractions of vice from the
younger part of the poor in great cities which exposes them to so many causes
of demoralisation. All this proceeds not from any unwonted or extraordinary
depravity in the character of these victims of licentiousness, but from the
almost irresistible nature of the temptations to which the poor are exposed.
The rich, who censure their conduct, would in all probability yield as rapidly
as they have done to the influence of similar causes. There is a certain degree
of misery, a certain proximity to sin, which virtue is rarely able to
withstand, and which the young, in particular, are generally unable to resist.
The progress of vice in such circumstances is almost as certain and often
nearly as rapid as that of physical contagion."</p>
<p class="fst">And elsewhere: </p>
<p class="indentb">"When the higher orders for their own profit have drawn the
labouring-classes in great numbers into a small space, the contagion of guilt
becomes rapid and unavoidable. The lower orders, situated as they are in so far
as regards moral or religious instructofion, are frequently hardly more to be
blamed for yielding to the temptations which surround them than for falling
victims to the typhus fever."</p>
<p class="fst">Enough! The half-bourgeois Alison betrays to us, however narrow
his manner of expressing himself, the evil effect of the great cities upon the
moral development of the workers. Another, a bourgeois <i>pur sang</i> <a href="#25" id="[25]1" name="[25]1"></a><a href="#25" id="[25]" name="[25]"><sup class="enote">[25]</sup></a> a man after the heart of the Anti-Corn Law League,
Dr. Andrew Ure,<a href="#26" id="[26]1" name="[26]1"></a><a href="#26" id="[26]" name="[26]"><sup class="enote">[26]</sup></a> betrays the other side.
He tells us that life in great cities facilitates cabals among the workers and
confers power on the Plebs. If here the workers are not educated (i.e., to
obedience to the bourgeoisie), they may view matters one-sidedly, from the
standpoint of a sinister selfishness, and may readily permit themselves to be
hoodwinked by sly demagogues; nay, they might even be capable of viewing their
greatest benefactors, the frugal and enterprising capitalists, with a jealous
and hostile eye. Here proper training alone can avail, or national bankruptcy
and other horrors must follow, since a revolution of the workers could hardly
fail to occur. And our bourgeois is perfectly justified in his fears. If the
centralisation of population stimulates and develops the property-holding
class, it forces the development of the workers yet more rapidly. The workers
begin to feel as a class, as a whole; they begin to perceive that, though
feeble as individuals, they form a power united; their separation from the
bourgeoisie, the development of views peculiar to the workers and corresponding
to their position in life, is fostered, the consciousness of oppression
awakens, and the workers attain social and political importance. The great
cities are the birthplaces of labour movements; in them the workers first began
to reflect upon their own condition, and to struggle against it; in them the
opposition between proletariat and bourgeoisie first made itself manifest; from
them proceeded the Trades Unions, Chartism, and Socialism. The great cities
have transformed the disease of the social body, which appears in chronic form
in the country, into an acute one, and so made manifest its real nature and the
means of curing it. Without the great cities and their forcing influence upon
the popular intelligence, the working-class would be far less advanced than it
is. Moreover, they have destroyed the last remnant of the patriarchal relation
between working-men and employers, a result to which manufacture on a large
scale has contributed by multiplying the employees dependent upon a single
employer. The bourgeoisie deplores all this, it is true, and has good reason to
do so; for, under the old conditions, the bourgeois was comparatively secure
against a revolt on the part of his hands. He could tyrannise over them and
plunder them to his heart's content, and yet receive obedience, gratitude, and
assent from these stupid people by bestowing a trifle of patronising
friendliness which cost him nothing, and perhaps some paltry present, all
apparently out of pure, self-sacrificing, uncalled-for goodness of heart, but
really not one-tenth part of his duty. As an individual bourgeois, placed under
conditions which he had not himself created, he might do his duty at least in
part; but, as a member of the ruling class, which, by the mere fact of its
ruling, is responsible for the condition of the whole nation, he did nothing of
what his position involved. On the contrary, he plundered the whole nation for
his own individual advantage. In the patriarchal relation that hypocritically
concealed the slavery of the worker, the latter must have remained an
intellectual zero, totally ignorant of his own interest, a mere private
individual. Only when estranged from his employer, when convinced that the sole
bond between employer and employee is the bond of pecuniary profit, when the
sentimental bond between them, which stood not the slightest test, had wholly
fallen away, then only did the worker begin to recognise his own interests and
develop independently; then only did he cease to be the slave of the
bourgeoisie in his thoughts, feelings, and the expression of his will. And to
this end manufacture on a grand scale and in great cities has most largely
contributed. </p>
<p>Another influence of great moment in forming the character of the English
workers is the Irish immigration already referred to. On the one hand it has,
as we have seen, degraded the English workers, removed them from civilisation,
and aggravated the hardship of their lot; but, on the other hand, it has
thereby deepened the chasm between workers and bourgeoisie, and hastened the
approaching crisis. For the course of the social disease from which England is
suffering is the same as the course of a physical disease; it develops
according to certain laws, has its own crises, the last and most violent of
which determines the fate of the patient. And as the English nation cannot
succumb under the final crisis, but must go forth from it, born again,
rejuvenated, we can but rejoice over everything which accelerates the course of
the disease. And to this the Irish immigration further contributes by reason of
the passionate, mercurial Irish temperament, which it imports into England and
into the English working-class. The Irish and English are to each other much as
the French and the Germans; and the mixing of the more facile, excitable, fiery
Irish temperament with the stable, reasoning, persevering English must, in the
long run, be productive only of good for both. The rough egotism of the English
bourgeoisie would have kept its hold upon the working-class much more firmly if
the Irish nature, generous to a fault, and ruled primarily by sentiment, had
not intervened, and softened the cold, rational English character in part by a
mixture of the races, and in part by the ordinary contact of life. </p>
<p>In view of all this, it is not surprising that the working-class has
gradually become a race wholly apart from the English bourgeoisie. The
bourgeoisie has more in common with every other nation of the earth than with
the workers in whose midst it lives. The workers speak other dialects, have
other thoughts and ideals, other customs and moral principles, a different
religion and other politics than those of the bourgeoisie. Thus they are two
radically dissimilar nations, as unlike as difference of race could make them,
of whom we on the Continent have known but one, the bourgeoisie. Yet it is
precisely the other, the people, the proletariat, which is by far the more
important for the future of England. <a href="#28" id="[28]"></a><a href="#28" id="[28]"><sup class="enote">[28]</sup></a> </p>
<p>Of the public character of the English working-man, as it finds expression
in associations and political principles, we shall have occasion to speak
later; let us here consider the results of the influences cited above, as they
affect the private character of the worker. The workman is far more humane in
ordinary life than the bourgeois. I have already mentioned the fact that the
beggars are accustomed to turn almost exclusively to the workers, and that, in
general, more is done by the workers than by the bourgeoisie for the
maintenance of the poor. This fact, which any one may prove for himself any
day, is confirmed, among others, by Dr. Parkinson, Canon of Manchester, who
says: <a href="#29" id="[29]"></a><a href="#29" id="[29]"><sup class="enote">[29]</sup></a> </p>
<p class="indentb">"The poor give more to each other than the rich give to the
poor. I am confirmed in this assertion by the testimony of one of our oldest,
most learned, and most observant physicians Dr. Bardsley, whose humanity is as
conspicuous as his learning and talent, and who has often publicly declared
that the aggregate sum given in each year by the poor to each other exceeds
that contributed by the rich in the same period."</p>
<p class="fst">In other ways, too, the humanity of the workers is constantly
manifesting itself pleasantly. They have experienced hard times themselves, and
can therefore feel for those in trouble, whence they are more approachable,
friendlier, and less greedy for money, though they need it far more than the
property-holding class. For them money is worth only what it will buy, whereas
for the bourgeois it has an especial inherent value, the value of a god, and
makes the bourgeois the mean, low money-grubber that he is. The working-man who
knows nothing of this feeling of reverence for money is therefore less grasping
than the bourgeois, whose whole activity is for the purpose of gain, who sees
in the accumulations of his money-bags the end and aim of life. Hence the
workman is much less prejudiced, has a clearer eye for facts as they are than
the bourgeois, and does not look at everything through the spectacles of
personal selfishness. His faulty education saves him from religious
prepossessions, he does not understand religious questions, does not trouble
himself about them, knows nothing of the fanaticism that holds the bourgeoisie
bound; and if he chances to have any religion, he has it only in name, not even
in theory. Practically he lives for this world, and strives to make himself at
home in it. All the writers of the bourgeoisie are unanimous on this point,
that the workers are not religious, and do not attend church. From the general
statement are to be excepted the Irish, a few elderly people, and the
half-bourgeois, the overlookers, foremen, and the like. But among the masses
there prevails almost universally a total indifference to religion, or at the
utmost, some trace of Deism too undeveloped to amount to more than mere words,
or a vague dread of the words infidel, atheist, etc. The clergy of all sects is
in very bad odour with the working-men, though the loss of its influence is
recent. At present, however, the mere cry: "He's a parson!" is often enough to
drive one of the clergy from the platform of a public meeting. And like the
rest of the conditions under which he lives, his want of religious and other
culture contributes to keep the working-man more unconstrained, freer from
inherited stab1e tenets and cut-and-dried opinions, than the bourgeois who is
saturated with the class prejudices poured into him from his earliest youth.
There is nothing to be done with the bourgeois; he is essentially conservative
in however liberal a guise, his interest is bound up with that of the
property-holding class, he is dead to all active movement; he is losing his
position in the forefront of England's historical development. The workers are
taking his place, in rightful claim first, then in fact. </p>
<p>All this, together with the correspondent public action of the workers, with
which we shall deal later, forms the favourable side of the character of this
class; the unfavourable one may be quite as briefly summed up, and follows
quite as naturally out of the given causes. Drunkenness, sexual irregularities,
brutality, and disregard for the rights of property are the chief points with
which the bourgeois charges them. That they drink heavily is to be expected.
Sheriff Alison asserts that in Glasgow some thirty thousand working-men get
drunk every Saturday night, and the estimate is certainly not exaggerated; and
that in that city in 1830, one house in twelve, and in 1840, one house in ten,
was a public-house; that in Scotland, in 1823, excise was paid upon 2,300,000
gallons; in 1837, upon 6,620,000 gallons; in England, in 1823, upon 1,976,000
gallons, and in 1837, upon 7,875,000 gallons of spirits.<a href="#30" id="[30]"></a><a href="#30" id="[30]"><sup class="enote">[30]</sup></a> The
Beer Act of 1830, which facilitated the opening of beerhouses (jerry-shops),
whose keepers are licensed to sell beer to be drunk on the premises,
facilitated the spread of intemperance by bringing a beerhouse, so to say, to
everybody's door. In nearly every street there are several such beerhouses, and
among two or three neighbouring houses in the country one is sure to be a
jerry-shop. Besides these, there are hush-shops in multitudes, i.e., secret
drinking-places which are not licensed, and quite as many secret distilleries
which product great quantities of spirits in retired spots, rarely visited by
the police, in the great cities. Gaskell estimates these secret distilleries in
Manchester alone at more than a hundred, and their product at 156,000 gallons
at the least. In Manchester there are, besides, more than a thousand public
houses selling all sorts of alcoholic drinks, or quite as many in proportion to
the number of inhabitants as in Glasgow. In all other great towns, the state of
things is the same. And when one considers, apart from the usual consequences
of intemperance, that men and women, even children, often mothers with babies
in their arms, come into contact in these places with the most degraded victims
of the bourgeois regime, with thieves, swindlers, and prostitutes; when one
reflects that many a mother gives the baby on her arm gin to drink, the
demoralising effects of frequenting such places cannot be denied. </p>
<p>On Saturday evenings, especially when wages are paid and work stops somewhat
earlier than usual, when the whole working-class pours from its own poor
quarters into the main thoroughfares, intemperance may be seen in all its
brutality. I have rarely come out of Manchester on such an evening without
meeting numbers of people staggering and seeing others lying in the gutter. On
Sunday evening the same scene is usually repeated, only less noisily. And when
their money is spent, the drunkards go to the nearest pawnshop, of which there
are plenty in every city – over sixty in Manchester, and ten or twelve in
a single street of Salford, Chapel Street – and pawn whatever they
possess. Furniture, Sunday clothes where such exist, kitchen utensils in masses
are fetched from the pawnbrokers on Saturday night only to wander back, almost
without fail, before the next Wednesday, until at last some accident makes the
final redemption impossible, and one article after another falls into the
clutches of the usurer, or until he refuses to give a single farthing more upon
the battered, used up pledge. When one has seen the extent of intemperance
among the workers in England, one readily believes Lord Ashley's statement<a href="#31" id="[31]"></a><a href="#31" id="[31]"><sup class="enote">[31]</sup></a> that this class annually expends something like
twenty-five million pounds sterling upon intoxicating liquor; and the
deterioration in external conditions, the frightful shattering of mental and
physical health, the ruin of all domestic relations which follow may readily be
imagined. True, the temperance societies have done much, but what are a few
thousand teetotallers among the millions of workers? When Father Mathew, the
Irish apostle of temperance, passes through the English cities, from thirty to
sixty thousand workers take the pledge; but most of them break it again within
a month. If one counts up the immense numbers who have taken the pledge in the
last three or four years in Manchester, the total is greater than the whole
population of the town – and still it is by no means evident that
intemperance is diminishing. </p>
<p>Next to intemperance in the enjoyment of intoxicating liquors, one of the
principal faults of English working-men is sexual licence. But this, too,
follows with relentless logic, with inevitable necessity out of the position of
a class left to itself, with no means of making fitting use of its freedom. The
bourgeoisie has left the working-class only these two pleasures, while imposing
upon it a multitude of labours and hardships, and the consequence is that the
working-men, in order to get something from life, concentrate their whole
energy upon these two enjoyments, carry them to excess, surrender to them in
the most unbridled manner. When people are placed under conditions which appeal
to the brute only, what remains to them but to rebel or to succumb to utter
brutality? And when, moreover, the bourgeoisie does its full share in
maintaining prostitution – and how many of the 40,000 prostitutes who
fill the streets of London every evening live upon the virtuous bourgeoisie!
How many of them owe it to the seduction of a bourgeois, that they must offer
their bodies to the passers-by in order to live? – surely it has least of
all a right to reproach the workers with their sexual brutality. </p>
<p>The failings of the workers in general may be traced to an unbridled thirst
for pleasure, to want of providence, and of flexibility in fitting into the
social order, to the general inability to sacrifice the pleasure of the moment
to a remoter advantage. But is that to be wondered at? When a class can
purchase few and only the most sensual pleasures by its wearying toil, must it
not give itself over blindly and madly to those pleasures? A class about whose
education no one troubles himself, which is a playball to a thousand chances,
knows no security in life – what incentives has such a class to
providence, to "respectability", to sacrifice the pleasure of the moment for a
remoter enjoyment, most uncertain precisely by reason of the perpetually
varying, shifting conditions under which the proletariat lives? A class which
bears all the disadvantages of the social order without enjoying its
advantages, one to which the social system appears in purely hostile aspects
– who can demand that such a class respect this social order? Verily that
is asking much! But the working-man cannot escape the present arrangement of
society so long as it exists, and when the individual worker resists it, the
greatest injury falls upon himself. </p>
<p>Thus the social order makes family life almost impossible for the worker. In
a comfortless, filthy house, hardly good enough for mere nightly shelter,
ill-furnished, often neither rain-tight nor warm, a foul atmosphere filling
rooms overcrowded with human beings, no domestic comfort is possible. The
husband works the whole day through, perhaps the wife also and the elder
children, all in different places; they meet night and morning only, all under
perpetual temptation to drink; what family life is possible under such
conditions? Yet the working-man cannot escape from the family, must live in the
family, and the consequence is a perpetual succession of family troubles,
domestic quarrels, most demoralising for parents and children alike. Neglect of
all domestic duties, neglect of the children, especially, is only too common
among the English working-people, and only too vigorously fostered by the
existing institutions of society. And children growing up in this savage way,
amidst these demoralising influences, are expected to turn out goody-goody and
moral in the end! Verily the requirements are naive, which the self-satisfied
bourgeois makes upon the working-man! </p>
<p>The contempt for the existing social order is most conspicuous in its
extreme form – that of offences against the law. If the influences
demoralising to the working-man act more powerfully, more concentratedly than
usual, he becomes an offender as certainly as water abandons the fluid for the
vaporous state at 80 degrees, Réaumur. Under the brutal and brutalising
treatment of the bourgeoisie, the working-man becomes precisely as much a thing
without volition as water, and is subject to the laws of Nature with precisely
the same necessity; at a certain point all freedom ceases. Hence with the
extension of the proletariat, crime has increased in England, and the British
nation has become the most criminal in the world. From the annual criminal
tables of the Home Secretary, it is evident that the increase of crime in
England has proceeded with incomprehensible rapidity. The numbers of arrests
for criminal offences reached in the years: 1805, 4,605, 1810, 5,146; 1815,
7,818; 1820, 13,710; 1825, 14,457; 1830, 18,107; 1835, 20,731; 1840, 27,187;
1841, 27,760; 1842, 31,309 in England and Wales alone. That is to say, they
increased sevenfold in thirty-seven years. Of these arrests, in 1842, 4,497
were made in Lancashire alone, or more than 14 per cent of the whole; and 4,094
in Middlesex, including London, or more than 13 per cent. So that two districts
which include great cities with large proletarian populations, produced
one-fourth of the total amount of crime, though their population is far from
forming one-fourth of the whole. Moreover, the criminal tables prove directly
that nearly all crime arises within the proletariat; for, in 1842, taking the
average, out of 100 criminals, 32.35 could neither read nor write; 58.32 read
and wrote imperfectly; 6.77 could read and write well; 0.22 had enjoyed a
higher education, while the degree of education of 2.34 could not be
ascertained. In Scotland, crime has increased yet more rapidly. There were but
89 arrests for criminal offences in 1819, and as early as 1837 the number had
risen to 3,126, and in 1842 to 4,189. In Lanarkshire, where Sheriff Alison
himself made out the official report, population has doubled once in thirty
years, and crime once in five and a half, or six times more rapidly than the
population. The offences, as in all civilised countries, are, in the great
majority of cases, against property, and have, therefore, arisen from want in
some form; for what a man has, he does not steal. The proportion of offences
against property to the population, which in the Netherlands is as 1:7,140 and
in France, as 1:1,804, was in England, when Gaskell wrote as 1:799. The
proportion of offences against persons to the population is, in the
Netherlands, 1:28,904; in France, 1:17,573; in England, 1:23,395; that of
crimes in general to the population in the agricultural districts, as 1:1,043;
in the manufacturing district as 1:840. <a href="#32" id="[32]"></a><a href="#32" id="[32]"><sup class="enote">[32]</sup></a> In the whole of
England today the proportion is 1:660; <a href="#33" id="[33]"></a><a href="#33" id="[33]"><sup class="enote">[33]</sup></a> though it is scarcely
ten years since Gaskell's book appeared! </p>
<p>These facts are certainly more than sufficient to bring any one, even a
bourgeois, to pause and reflect upon the consequences of such a state of
things. If demoralisation and crime multiply twenty years longer in this
proportion (and if English manufacture in these twenty years should be less
prosperous than heretofore, the progressive multiplication of crime can only
continue the more rapidly), what will the result be? Society is already in a
state of visible dissolution; it is impossible to pick up a newspaper without
seeing the most striking evidence of the giving way of all social ties. I look
at random into a heap of English journals lying before me; there is the
<i>Manchester Guardian</i> for October 30, 1844, which reports for three
days. It no longer takes the trouble to give exact details as to Manchester,
and merely relates the most interesting cases: that the workers in a mill have
struck for higher wages without giving notice, and been condemned by a Justice
of the Peace to resume work; that in Salford a couple of boys had been caught
stealing, and a bankrupt tradesman tried to cheat his creditors. From the
neighbouring towns the reports are more detailed: in Ashton, two thefts, one
burglary, one suicide; in Bury one theft; in Bolton, two thefts, one revenue
fraud; in Leigh, one theft; in Oldham, one strike for wages, one theft, one
fight between Irish women, one non-Union hatter assaulted by Union men, one
mother beaten by her son, one attack upon the police, one robbery of a church;
in Stockport, discontent of working-men with wages, one theft, one fraud, one
fight, one wife beaten by her husband; in Warrington, one theft, one fight; in
Wigan, one theft, and one robbery of a church. The reports of the London papers
are much worse; frauds, thefts, assaults, family quarrels crowd one another. A
<i>Times</i> of September 12, 1844, falls into my hand, which gives a report
of a single day, including a theft, an attack upon the police, a sentence upon
a father requiring him to support his illegitimate son, the abandonment of a
child by its parents, and the poisoning of a man by his wife. Similar reports
are to be found in all the English papers. In this country, social war is under
full headway, every one stands for himself, and fights for himself against all
comers, and whether or not he shall injure all the others who are his declared
foes, depends upon a cynical calculation as to what is most advantageous for
himself. It no longer occurs to any one to come to a peaceful understanding
with his fellow-man; all differences are settled by threats, violence, or in a
law-court. In short, every one sees in his neighbour an enemy to be got out of
the way, or, at best, a tool to be used for his own advantage. And this war
grows from year to year, as the criminal tables show, more violent, passionate,
irreconcilable. The enemies are dividing gradually into two great camps –
the bourgeoisie on the one hand, the workers on the other. This war of each
against all, of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat, need cause us no
surprise, for it is only the logical sequel of the principle involved in free
competition. But it may very well surprise us that the bourgeoisie remains so
quiet and composed in the face of the rapidly gathering storm-clouds, that it
can read all these things daily in the papers without, we will not say
indignation at such a social condition, but fear of its consequences, of a
universal outburst of that which manifests itself symptomatically from day to
day in the form of crime. But then it is the bourgeoisie, and from its
standpoint cannot even see the facts, much less perceive their consequences.
One thing only is astounding, that class prejudice and preconceived opinions
can hold a whole class of human beings in such perfect, I might almost say,
such mad blindness. Meanwhile, the development of the nation goes its way
whether the bourgeoisie has eyes for it or not, and will surprise the property-
holding class one day with things not dreamed of in its philosophy.</p>

<h3>NOTES</h3>
<p><a id="1"></a>1. When as here and elsewhere I speak of society as a
responsible whole, having rights and duties, I mean, of course, the ruling
power of society, the class which at present holds social and political
control, and bears, therefore, the responsibility for the condition of those to
whom it grants no share in such control. This ruling class in England, as in
all other civilised countries, is the bourgeoisie. But that this society, and
especially the bourgeoisie, is charged with the duty of protecting every member
of society, at least, in his life, to see to it, for example, that no one
starves, I need not now prove to my German readers. If I were writing for the
English bourgeoisie, the case would be different.– <i>Note by Engels to

<h4>[Paris, end of January-February 1845]</h4>
<p class="fst">Dear Friend,</p>
<p class="fst">I hope to have time to see you tomorrow. I am due to leave on Monday.<a href="#n1">[1]</a></p>
<p>The publisher Leske has just been to see me. He is bringing out a quarterly
<a href="#n2">[2]</a> in Darmstadt which is not subject to censorship.
Engels, Hess, Herwegh, Jung and I, etc., are collaborating with him. He
has asked me to solicit your cooperation -- poetry or prose. Since we must
make use of every opportunity to establish ourselves in Germany, you will
surely not decline.</p>
<p> Of all the people I am leaving behind here, those I leave with
most regret are the Heines. I would gladly include you in my luggage! Best
regards to your wife <a href="#n3">[3]</a> from mine and myself.</p>
<p>Yours</p>
<p>K. Marx</p>
<hr class="end"/>
<h3>NOTES</h3>
<p class="fst">
The letter has no date. The approximate date of its writing is established
on the basis of Marx's mentioning in it his imminent departure from Paris
due to the expulsion decree issued against him by the French authorities,
and also his meeting with the publisher Leske during which he probably
concluded the contract for publishing his <i>Kritik der Politik und
National-ökonomie</i>, which was signed on 1 February 1845.</p>

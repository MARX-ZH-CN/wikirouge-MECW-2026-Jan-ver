Critical Criticism’s Correspondence</h1>

<h3>1) The Critical Mass</h3>
<p class="quoteb">Où peut-on être mieux<br>
Qu'au sein de sa famine?<br>
<span class="context">[Where can one feel better</span><br>
<span class="context">Than in the bosom of one’s family?</span><br>
<span class="context">From J. F. Marmontel’s one-act comedy Lucile.]</span></p>
<p>In its <i>Absolute</i> existence as Herr <i>Bruno</i>, Critical Criticism has declared the <i>mass</i> of mankind, the whole of mankind that is not Critical Criticism, to be its <i>opposite</i>, its<i> essential object; essential,</i> because the Mass exists <i>ad majorem gloriam dei</i> <span class="context">[For the greater glory of God]</span>, the glory of <i>Criticism</i>, of <i>the</i> Spirit; <i>its object, </i>because it is only the <i>matter</i> on which Critical Criticism operates. Critical Criticism has proclaimed its relationship to the Mass as the <i>world-historic relationship</i> of the present time.</p>
<p>No <i>world-historic opposition</i> is formed, however, by the statement that one is in opposition to the whole world. One can imagine that one is a stumbling-block for the world because one is clumsy enough to stumble everywhere. But for a world-historic opposition it is not enough for me to declare the world <i>my</i> opposite; the <i>world</i> for its part must declare me to be its essential opposite, and must treat and <i>recognise</i> me as such. Critical Criticism ensures itself this recognition by its <i>correspondence</i>, which is called upon to <i>bear witness</i> before the world to Criticism’s function of redeemer and equally to the general <i>irritation</i> of the world at the Critical gospel. Critical Criticism is its own object as the <i>object of the </i>world. The correspondence is intended to <i>show it as such, </i>as the <i>world interest</i> of the present time.</p>
<p>Critical Criticism is in its own eyes the <i>Absolute Subject</i>. The Absolute Subject requires a cult. A real cult requires other believing individuals. The <i>Holy Family of Charlottenburg</i> therefore receives from its correspondents the cult due to it. The correspondents tell it <i>what it is</i> and what its adversary, the Mass, <i>is not</i>.</p>
<p>However, Criticism falls into an inconsistency by thus having its opinion of itself represented as the opinion of the world and by its <i>concept</i> being converted into <i>reality</i>. <i>Within Criticism itself</i> a sort of <i>Mass</i> is forming, a Critical Mass whose simple function is untiringly to echo the stock phrases of Criticism. For consistency’s sake this inconsistency may be forgiven. Not feeling at home in the sinful world, Critical Criticism must set up a sinful world in its own home.</p>
<p>The path of Critical Criticism’s correspondent, a member of the Critical Mass, is not a rosy one. It is a difficult, thorny path, a Critical path. Critical Criticism is a spiritualistic lord, pure spontaneity, actus purus, intolerant of any influence <i>from without</i>. The correspondent can therefore be a <i>subject</i> only <i>in appearance</i>, can only <i>seem</i> to behave <i>independently</i> towards Critical Criticism, can only <i>seemingly</i> want to communicate something new and of his own to it. In <i>reality</i> he is Critical Criticism’s own <i>product</i>, its perception of its own voice made for an instant <i>objective</i> and self-existing.</p>
<p>That is why the correspondents do not fail to assert incessantly that Critical Criticism itself <i>knows, realises, understands, grasps</i>, and <i>experiences</i> what at the same moment is being communicated to it for <i>appearance’s sake</i>.<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume04/footnote.html#61" target=_blank>[61]</a></sup> Thus <i>Zerrleder</i>, for instance, uses the expressions: “Do you grasp it? You know. You know for the second and third time. You’ have probably heard enough to be able to see for yourself.”</p>
<p>So too the Breslau correspondent <i>Fleischammer</i> says: “But the fact,” etc., “will be as little of a puzzle to you as to me.” Or the Zurich correspondent <i>Hirzel</i>: “You will probably find out for yourself.” The Critical correspondent has such anxious respect for the absolute understanding of <i>Critical Criticism</i> that he attributes understanding to it even where there is absolutely nothing to understand. For example, <i>Fleischhammer</i> says:</p>
<p class="quoteb">You will <i>perfectly </i>[!] <i>understand</i> [!] me when I tell you that one can hardly go out without meeting young Catholic priests in their long black cowls and cloaks.”</p>
<p>Indeed, in their <i>fear</i> the correspondents <i>hear</i> Critical Criticism — <i>saying</i>, <i>answering</i>, <i>exclaiming</i>, <i>deriding</i>!</p>
<p><i>Zeerleder</i>, for example, says: “But — you <i>say</i>. Well, then, listen.” And <i>Fleischhammer</i>. “Yes, I hear what <i>you say</i> — I <i>only</i> mean that...” And <i>Hirzel</i>: “Good for you, you <i>will exclaim</i>!” And a Tübingen correspondent: “<i>Do not laugh</i> at me!”</p>
<p>The correspondents, therefore, also express themselves as though they were communicating <i>facts</i> to Critical Criticism and expect from it the <i>spiritual interpretation</i>; they provide it with <i>premises</i> and leave the <i>conclusion</i> to it, or they even <i>apologise </i>for repeating things Criticism has known for a long time.</p>
<p><i>Zerrleder</i>, for example, says:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Your correspondent can only give a picture, a description of the facts. The Spirit which animates these things is <i>certainly</i> not unknown to <i>you</i>.” Or again: “Now you will <i>surely</i> draw the <i>conclusion for yourself</i>.”</p>
<p>And <i>Hirzel</i> says:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“<i>I shall not presume</i> to entertain you with the speculative proposition that every creation arises out of its extreme opposite.”</p>
<p>Sometimes, too, the <i>experiences</i> of the correspondents are merely the <i>fulfilment</i> and <i>confirmation</i> of Criticism’s <i>prophecies</i>.</p>
<p><i>Fleischhammer</i>, for example, says:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Your <i>prediction</i> has come true.”</p>
<p>And <i>Zerrleder</i>:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Far from being disastrous, the tendencies that I have described to you as gaining ever greater scope in Switzerland, are very <i>fortunate</i>; they <i>only confirm</i> the <i>thought you</i> have already often expressed,” etc.</p>
<p>Critical Criticism sometimes feels urged to express the condescension involved by its participation in the correspondence and motivates this condescension by the fact that the correspondent has successfully carried out some <i>task</i>. Thus Herr Bruno writes to the Tübingen correspondent:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“It is really inconsistent on my part to answer your letter. — On the other hand, you have again ... made such an <i>apt remark</i> that I ... <i>cannot refuse</i> the explanation you request.” <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume04/footnote.html#62" target=_blank>[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>Critical Criticism has letters written to it <i>from the provinces</i>; not the provinces in the political sense, which, as we know, do not exist anywhere in Germany, but from the <i>Critical provinces</i> of which. Berlin is the capital, <i>Berlin</i>, the seat of the Critical patriarchs and of the Holy Critical Family, whereas the provinces are where the Critical Mass resides. The <i>Critical provincials</i> dare not engage the attention of the <i>supreme Critical authority</i> without bows and apologies.</p>
<p>Thus, someone writes anonymously to Herr <i>Edgar</i>, who, being a member of the Holy Family, is also an eminent personage:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Honourable Sir, I hope you will <i>excuse</i> these lines on the grounds that young people like to unite in common strivings (there is not more than two years’ <i>difference</i> in our ages).”</p>
<p>The coeval of Herr Edgar describes <i>himself</i> incidentally as the <i>essence of modern philosophy</i>. Is it not in the nature of things that <i>Criticism</i> should correspond with <i>the essence </i>of philosophy? If Herr Edgar’s coeval affirms that he has already lost his <i>teeth</i>, that is only an allusion to his <i>allegorical</i> essence. This “essence of modern philosophy” has “learned from <i>Feuerbach</i> to set the factor of education in objective view”. It at once gives a sample of its <i>education</i> and <i>views</i> by assuring Herr Edgar that it has acquired a “<i>complete view</i> of his short story”, “<i>Es leben feste Grundsätze</i>!” <span class="context">[Long Live firm principles!” A. Weill und E. Bauer, Berliner Novellen]</span> At the same time it openly admits that Herr Edgar’s point of view is by no means quite clear to it, and finally invalidates the assurance concerning the complete view by the question: “Or have I <i>completely misunderstood</i> you?” After this sample it will be found quite normal that the essence of modern philosophy, referring to the Mass, should say:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“We must at least once <i>condescend</i> to examine and untie the magic knot which bars <i>common human reason</i> from access to the <i>unrestricted</i> <i>flood of thought.</i>”</p>
<p>In order to get a complete view of the Critical Mass one should read the <i>correspondence</i> of Herr <i>Hirzel</i> from Zurich (Heft V). This unfortunate man memorises the stock phrases of Criticism with really touching docility and praiseworthy power of recall, not omitting Herr Bruno’s favourite phrases about the battles he has waged and the campaigns he has planned and led. But Herr <i>Hirzel</i> exercises his profession as a member of the Critical Mass especially by raging against. the <i>profane Mass</i> and its attitude to <i>Critical Criticism</i>.</p>
<p>He speaks of the Mass claiming a part in history, “of the pure Mass”, of “pure Criticism”, of the “purity of this contradiction” — “a contradiction purer than any that history has provided” — of the “<i>discontented being</i>”, of the “perfect emptiness, ill humour, dejection, heartlessness, timidity, fury and bitterness of the Mass towards Criticism”; of “the Mass which only exists in order by its resistance to make Criticism sharper and more vigilant”. He speaks of “creation from the extreme opposite”, of how Criticism is above <i>hate</i> and similar profane sentiments. The whole of Herr <i>Hirzel’s</i> contribution to the <i>Literatur-Zeitung</i> is confined to this profusion of Critical stock phrases. While reproaching the Mass for being satisfied with mere “disposition”, “good will”, “the phrase”, “faith”, etc., he himself, as a member of the <i>Critical</i> <i>Mass,</i> a content with phrases, expressions of his “Critical disposition”, his “Critical faith”, his “Critical good will” and leaves “action, work, struggle” and “works” to Herr Bruno and Co.</p>
<p>Despite the terrible picture of the world-historic tension between the profane world and “Critical Criticism” which the members of the “Critical Mass” outline, for the non-believer at least not even the fact of the matter is stated, the factual existence of this <i>world-historic</i> tension. The obliging and un-Critical repetition of Criticism’s “imaginations” and “pretensions” by the correspondents only proves that the fixed ideas of the master are the fixed ideas of the servant as well. It is true that one of the Critical correspondents <span class="context">[The reference is to the author of an anonymous report published in the Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung, Heft VI, May 1844, in the section “Correspondenz aus der Provinz"]</span> makes an attempt at a proof based on <i>fact</i>.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“You see,” he writes to the Holy Family, “that the <i>Literatur-Zeitung </i>is fulfilling its purpose, ie., that it meets with <i>no approval</i>. It could meet with approval only if it sounded in unison with the general thoughtlessness, if you strode proudly before it with the jingling of hackneyed phrases of a whole janissary band of current categories.”</p>
<p>The jingling of hackneyed phrases of a whole janissary band of current categories It is evident that the Critical correspondent does his best to keep pace with non-"current” hackneyed phrases. But his explanation of the fact that the <i>Literatur-Zeitung</i> meets with no approval must he rejected as purely <i>apologetic</i>. This fact could be better explained in just the opposite way by saying that Critical Criticism is in <i>unison</i> with the great mass, to be precise, the great <i>mass</i> of scribblers who meet with no approval.</p>
<p>It is therefore not enough for the <i>Critical</i> correspondent to address Critical hackneyed phrases to the Holy Family as “prayers” and at the same time to the Mass as “anathemas”. <i>Un-Critical, mass-type</i> correspondents, <i>real</i> delegates of the <i>Mass</i> to Critical Criticism, are needed to show the real tension between the Mass and Criticism.</p>
<p>That is why Critical Criticism also assigns a place to the <i>un-Critical Mass</i>. It makes unbiased <i>representatives</i> of the latter <i>correspond</i> with it, acknowledge the opposition to itself, Criticism, as important and absolute, and utter a <i>fearful cry</i> for redemption from this opposition.</p>

Conversion of Profit into Average Profit</p>
<h1>Chapter 10. Equalisation of the General Rate of Profit Through
Competition.<br>
Market-Prices and Market-Values. Surplus-Profit</h1>
<p> </p>
<p class="fst">The capital invested in some spheres of production has a mean,
or average, composition, that is, it has the same, or almost the same
composition as the average social capital.</p>
<p>In these spheres the price of production is exactly or almost the same as
the value of the produced commodity expressed in money. If there were no other
way of reaching a mathematical limit, this would be the one. Competition so
distributes the social capital among the various spheres of production that the
prices of production in each sphere take shape according to the model of the
prices of production in these spheres of average composition, i.e., they = k +
kp' (cost-price plus the average rate of profit multiplied by the cost price).
This average rate of profit, however, is the percentage of profit in that
sphere of average composition in which profit, therefore, coincides with
surplus-value. Hence, the rate of profit is the same in all spheres of
production, for it is equalized on the basis of those average spheres of
production which has the average composition of capital. Consequently, the sum
of the profits in all spheres of production must equal the sum of the
surplus-values, and the sum of the prices of production of the total social
product equal the sum of its value. But it is evident that the balance among
spheres of production of different composition must tend to equalize them with
the spheres of average composition, be it exactly or only approximately the
same as the social average. Between the spheres more or less approximating the
average there is again a tendency toward equalization, seeking the ideal
average, i.e., an average that does not really exist, i.e., a tendency to take
this ideal as a standard. In this way the tendency necessarily prevails to make
the prices of production merely converted forms of value, or to turn profits
into mere portions of surplus-value. However, these are not distributed in
proportion to the surplus-value produced in each special sphere of production,
but rather in proportion to the mass of capital employed in each sphere, so
that equal masses of capital, whatever their composition, receive equal aliquot
shares of the total surplus-value produced by the total social capital.</p>
<p>In the case of capitals of average, or approximately average, composition,
the price of production is thus the same or almost the same as the value, and
the profit the same as the surplus-value produced by them. All other capitals,
of whatever composition, tend toward this average under pressure of
competition. But since the capitals of average composition are of the same, or
approximately the same, structure as the average social capital, all capitals
have the tendency, regardless of the surplus-value produced by them, to realize
the average profit, rather than their own surplus-value in the price of their
commodity, i.e., to realize the prices of production.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it may be said that wherever an average profit, and
therefore a general rate of profit, is produced — no matter by what means
— such an average profit cannot be anything but the profit on the average
social capital, whose sum is equal to the sum of surplus-value. Moreover, the
prices obtained by adding this average profit to the cost-prices cannot be
anything but the values transmuted into prices of production. Nothing would be
altered if capitals in certain spheres of production would not, for some
reason, be subject to the process of equalization. The average profit would
then be computed on that portion of the social capital which enters the
equalization process. It is evident that the average profit can be nothing but
the total mass of surplus-values allotted to the various quantities of capital
proportionally to their magnitudes in their different spheres of production. It
is the total realized unpaid labour, and this total mass, like the paid,
congealed or living, labour, obtains in the total mass of commodities and money
that falls to the capitalists.</p>
<p>The really difficult question is this: how is this equalization of profits
into a general rate of profit brought about, since it is obviously a result
rather than a point of departure?</p>
<p>To begin with, an estimate of the values of commodities, for instance in
terms of money, can obviously only be the result of their exchange. If,
therefore, we assume such an estimate, we must regard it as the outcome of an
actual exchange of commodity-value for commodity-value. But how does this
exchange of commodities at their real value come about?</p>
<p>Let us first assume that all commodities in the different branches of
production are sold at their real values. What would then be the outcome?
According to the foregoing, very different rates of profit would then reign in
the various spheres of production. It is <i>prima facie</i> two entirely
different matters whether commodities are sold at their values (i.e., exchanged
in proportion to the value contained in them at prices corresponding to their
value), or whether they are sold at such prices that their sale yields equal
profits for equal masses of the capital advanced for their respective
production.</p>
<p>The fact that capitals employing unequal amounts of living labour produce
unequal amounts of surplus-value, presupposes at least to a certain extent that
the degree of exploitation or the rate of surplus-value are the same, or that
any existing differences in them are equalized by real or imaginary
(conventional) grounds of compensation. This would assume competition among
labourers and equalization through their continual migration from one sphere of
production to another. Such a general rate of surplus-value — viewed as a
tendency, like all other economic laws — has been assumed by us for the
sake of theoretical simplification. But in reality it is an actual premise of
the capitalist mode of production, although it is more or less obstructed by
practical frictions causing more or less considerable local differences, such
as the settlement laws for farm-labourers in Britain. But in theory it is
assumed that the laws of capitalist production operate in their pure form. In
reality there exists only approximation; but, this approximation is the
greater, the more developed the capitalist mode of production and the less it
is adulterated and amalgamated with survivals of former economic conditions.</p>
<p>The whole difficulty arises from the fact that commodities are not exchanged
simply as <i>commodities</i>, but as <i>products of capitals</i>, which
claim participation in the total amount of surplus-value, proportional to their
magnitude, or equal if they are of equal magnitude. And this claim is to be
satisfied by the total price for commodities produced by a given capital in a
certain space of time. This total price is, however, only the sum of the prices
of the individual commodities produced by this capital.</p>
<p>The <i>punctum saliens</i> will be best brought if we approach the matter
as follows: suppose, the labourers themselves are in possession of their
respective means of production and exchange their commodities with one another.
In that case these commodities would not be products of capital. The value of
the various means of labour and raw materials would differ in accordance with
the technical nature of the labours performed in the different branches of
production. Furthermore, aside from the unequal value of the means of
production employed by them, they would require different quantities of means
of production for given quantities of labour, depending on whether a certain
commodity can be finished in one hour, another in one day, and so forth. Also
suppose the labourers work an equal average length of time, allowing for
compensations that arise from the different labour intensities, etc. In such a
case, two labourers would, first, both have replaced their outlays, the
cost-prices of the consumed means of production, in the commodities which make
up the product of their day's work. These outlays would differ, depending on
the technical nature of their labour. Secondly, both of them would have created
equal amounts of new value, namely the working-day added by them to the means
of production. This would comprise their wages plus the surplus-value, the
latter representing surplus-labour over and above their necessary wants, the
product of which would however belong to them. To put it the capitalist way,
both of them receive the same wages plus the same profit, or the same value,
expressed, say, by the product of a ten-hour working-day. But in the first
place, the values of their commodities would have to differ. In commodity I,
for instance, the portion of value corresponding to the consumed means of
production might be higher than in commodity II. And, to introduce all possible
differences, we might assume right now that commodity I absorbs more living
labour, and consequently requires more labour-time to be produced, than
commodity II. The values of commodities I and II are, therefore, very
different. So are the sums of the values of the commodities, which represent
the product of the labour performed by labourers I and II in a given time. The
rates of profit would also differ considerably for I and II if we take the rate
of profit to be the proportion of the surplus-value to the total value of the
invested means of production. The means of subsistence daily consumed by I and
II during production, which take the place of wages, here form the part of the
invested means of production ordinarily called variable capital. But for equal
working periods the surplus values would be the same for I and II, or, more
precisely, since I and II each receive the value of the product of a day's
work, both of them receive equal values after the value of the invested
"constant" elements has been deducted, and one portion of those equal values
may be regarded as a substitute for the means of subsistence consumed in
production, and the other as surplus-value in excess of it. If labourer I has
greater expenses, they are made good by a greater portion of the value of his
commodity, which replaces this "constant " part, and he therefore has to
reconvert a larger portion of the total value of his product into the material
elements of this constant part, while labourer II, though receiving less for
this, has so much less to reconvert. In these circumstances, a difference in
the rates of profit would therefore be immaterial, just as it is immaterial to
the wage-labourer today what rate of profit may express the amount of
surplus-value filched from him, and just as in international commerce the
difference in the various national rates of profit is immaterial to commodity
exchange. </p>
<p>The exchange of commodities at their values, or approximately at their
values, thus requires a much lower stage than their exchange at their prices of
production, which requires a definite level of capitalist development. </p>
<p>Whatever the manner in which the prices of various commodities are first
mutually fixed or regulated, their movements are always governed by the law of
value. If the labour-time required for their production happens to shrink,
prices fall; if it increases, prices rise, provided other conditions remain the
same. </p>
<p>Apart from the domination of prices and price movement by the law of value,
it is quite appropriate to regard the values of commodities as not only
theoretically but also historically <i>prius</i> to the prices of production.
This applies to conditions in which the labourer owns his means of production,
and this is the condition of the land-owning farmer living off his own labour
and the craftsman, in the ancient as well as in the modern world. This agrees
also with the view we expressed previously that the evolution of products into
commodities arises through exchange between different communities, not between
the members of the same community. It holds not only for this primitive
condition, but also for subsequent conditions, based on slavery and serfdom,
and for the guild organisation of handicrafts, so long as the means of
production involved in each branch of production can be transferred from one
sphere to another only with difficulty and therefore the various spheres of
production are related to one another, within certain limits, as foreign
countries or communist communities. </p>
<p>For prices at which commodities are exchanged to approximately correspond to
their values, nothing more is necessary than 1) for the exchange of the various
commodities to cease being purely accidental or only occasional; 2) so far as
direct exchange of commodities is concerned, for these commodities to be
produced on both sides in approximately sufficient quantities to meet mutual
requirements, something learned from mutual experience in trading and therefore
a natural outgrowth of continued trading; and 3) so far as selling is
concerned, for no natural or artificial monopoly to enable either of the
contracting sides to sell commodities above their value or to compel them to
undersell. By accidental monopoly we mean a monopoly which a buyer or seller
acquires through an accidental state of supply and demand. </p>
<p>The assumption that the commodities of the various spheres of production are
sold at their value merely implies, of course, that their value is the centre
of gravity around which their prices fluctuate, and their continual rises and
drops tend to equalise. There is also the <i>market-value</i> — of
which later — to be distinguished from the individual value of particular
commodities produced by different producers. The individual value of some of
these commodities will be below their market-value (that is, less labour time
is required for their production than expressed is the market value) while that
of others will exceed the market-value. On the one hand, market-value is to be
viewed as the average value of commodities produced in a single sphere, and, on
the other, as the individual value of the commodities produced under average
conditions of their respective sphere and forming the bulk of the products of
that sphere. It is only in extraordinary combinations that commodities produced
under the worst, or the most favourable, conditions regulate the market-value,
which, in turn, forms the centre of fluctuation for market-prices. The latter,
however, are the same for commodities of the same kind. If the ordinary demand
is satisfied by the supply of commodities of average value, hence of a value
midway between the two extremes, then the commodities whose individual value is
below the market-value realise an extra surplus-value, or surplus-profit, while
those, whose individual value exceeds the market-value, are unable to realise a
portion of the surplus-value contained in them. </p>
<p>It does no good to say that the sale of commodities produced under the least
favourable conditions proves that they are required to satisfy the demand. If
in the assumed case the price were higher than the average market-value, the
demand would be smaller. At a certain price, a commodity occupies just so much
place on the market. This place remains the same in case of a price change only
if the higher price is accompanied by a drop in the supply of the commodity,
and a lower price by an increase of supply. And if the demand is so great that
it does not contract when the price is regulated by the value of commodities
produced under the least favourable conditions, then these determine the
market-value. This is not possible unless demand is greater than usual, or if
supply drops below the usual level. Finally, if the mass of the produced
commodities exceeds the quantity disposed of at average market-values, the
commodities produced under the most favourable conditions regulate the
market-value. They may, for example, be sold exactly or approximately at their
individual value, in which case the commodities produced under the least
favourable conditions may not even realise their cost-price, while those
produced under average conditions realise only a portion of the surplus-value
contained in them. What has been said here of market-value applies to the price
of production as soon as it takes the place of market-value. The price of
production is regulated in each sphere, and likewise regulated by special
circumstances. And this price of production is, in its turn, the centre around
which the daily market-prices fluctuate and tend to equalise one another within
definite periods. (See Ricardo on determining the price of production through
those working under the least favourable conditions.) </p>
<p>No matter how the prices are regulated, we arrive at the following: </p>
<p>1) The law of value dominates price movements with reductions or increases
in required labour-time making prices of production fall or rise. It is in this
sense that Ricardo (who doubtlessly realised that his prices of production
deviated from the value of commodities) says that "the inquiry to which I wish
to draw the reader's attention relates to the effect of the variations in the
relative value of commodities, and not in their absolute value".</p>
<p>2 ) The average profit determining the prices of production must always be
approximately equal to that quantity of surplus-value which falls to the share
of individual capital in its capacity of an aliquot part of the total social
capital. Suppose that the general rate of profit, and therefore the average
profit, are expressed by money-value greater than the money-value of the actual
average surplus-value. So far as the capitalists are concerned, it is then
immaterial whether they reciprocally charge 10 or 15% profit. Neither of these
percentages covers more actual commodity-value than the other, since the
overcharge in money is mutual. As for the labourer (the assumption being that
he receives his normal wage and the rise in the average profit does not
therefore imply an actual deduction from his wage, i.e., it expresses something
entirely different from the normal surplus-value of the capitalist), the rise
in commodity-prices caused by an increase of the average profit must correspond
to the rise of the money-expression of the variable capital. Such a general
nominal increase in the rate of profit and the average profit above the limit
provided by the ratio of the actual surplus-value to the total invested capital
is not, in effect, possible without causing an increase in wages, and also an
increase in the prices of commodities forming the constant capital. The reverse
is true in case of a reduction. Since the total value of the commodities
regulates the total surplus-value, and this in turn regulates the level of
average profit and thereby the general rate of profit — as a general law
or a law governing fluctuations — it follows the law of value regulates
the prices of production.</p>
<p>What competition, first in a single sphere, achieves is a single
market-value and market-price derived from the various individual values of
commodities. And it is competition of capitals in different spheres, which
first brings out the price of production equalizing the rates of profit in the
different spheres. The latter process requires a higher development of
capitalist production that the previous one. </p>
<p>For commodities of the same sphere of production, the same kind, and
approximately the same quality, to be sold at their values, the following two
requirements are necessary:</p>
<p><i>First</i>, the different individual values must be equalized at one
social value, the above-named market value, and this implies competition among
producers of the same kind of commodities and, likewise, the existence of a
common market in which they offer their articles for sale. For the market-price
of identical commodities, each, however, produced under different individual
circumstances, to correspond to the market-value and not to deviate from it
either by rising above or falling below it, it is necessary that the pressure
exerted by different sellers upon one another be sufficient to bring enough
commodities to market to fill the social requirements, i.e., a quantity for
which society is capable of paying the market-value. Should the mass of
products exceed this demand, the commodities would have to be sold below their
market-value; and conversely, above their market-value if the mass of products
were not large enough to meet the demand, or, what amounts to the same, if the
pressure of competition among sellers were not strong enough to bring this mass
of products to market. Should the market-value change, this would also entail a
change in the conditions on which the total mass of commodities could be sold.
Should the market-value fall, this would entail a rise in the average social
demand (this always taken to mean the effective demand), which could, within
certain limits, absorb larger masses of commodities. Should the market-value
rise, this would entail a drop in the social demand, and a smaller mass of
commodities would be absorbed. Hence, if supply and demand regulate the
market-price, or rather the deviations of the market-price from the
market-value, then, in turn, the market-value regulates the ratio of supply to
demand, or the centre round which fluctuations of supply and demand cause
market-prices to oscillate. </p>
<p>Looking closer, we find that the conditions applicable to the value of an
individual commodity are here reproduced as conditions governing the value of
the aggregate of a certain kind of commodity. Capitalist production is mass
production from the very outset. But even in other, less developed, modes of
production that which is produced in relatively small quantities as a common
product by small-scale, even if numerous, producers, is concentrated in large
quantities — at least in the case of the vital commodities — in the
hands of relatively few merchants. The latter accumulate them and sell them as
the common product of an entire branch of production, or of a more or less
considerable contingent of it. </p>
<p>It should be here noted in passing that the "social demand," i.e., the
factor which regulates the principle of demand, is essentially subject to the
mutual relationship of the different classes and their respective economic
position, notably therefore to, firstly, the ratio of total surplus-value to
wages, and, secondly, to the relation of the various parts into which
surplus-value is split up (profit, interest, ground-rent, taxes, etc.). And
this thus again shows how absolutely nothing can be explained by the relation
of supply to demand before ascertaining the basis on which this relation rests.
</p>
<p>Although both commodity and money represent a unity of exchange-value and
use-value, we have already seen that in buying and selling both of these
functions are polarised at the two extremes, the commodity (seller)
representing the use-value, and the money (buyer) representing the
exchange-value. One of the first premises of selling was that a commodity
should have use-value and should therefore satisfy a social need. The other
premise was that the quantity of labour contained in the commodity should
represent socially necessary labour, i.e., its individual value (and, what
amounts to the same under the present assumption, its selling price) should
coincide with its social value. </p>
<p>Let us apply this to the mass of commodities available in the market, which
represents the product of a whole sphere. </p>
<p>The matter will be most readily pictured by regarding this whole mass of
commodities, produced by <i>one </i>branch of industry, as <i>one
</i>commodity, and the sum of the prices of the many identical commodities as
<i>one </i>price. Then, whatever has been said of a single commodity applies
literally to the mass of commodities of an entire branch of production
available in the market. The requirement that the individual value of a
commodity should correspond to its social value is now realised, or further
determined, in that the mass contains social labour necessary for its
production, and that the value of this mass is equal to its market-value. </p>
<p>Now suppose that the bulk of these commodities is produced under
approximately similar normal social conditions, so that this value is at the
same time the individual value of the individual commodities which make up this
mass. If a relatively small portion of these commodities may now have been
produced below, and another above, these conditions, so that the individual
value of one portion is greater, and that of the other smaller, than the
average value of the bulk of the commodities, but in such proportions that
these extremes balance one another, so that the average value of the
commodities at these extremes is equal to the value of commodities in the
centre, then the market-value is determined by the value of the commodities
produced under average conditions. The value of the entire mass of commodities
is equal to the actual sum of the values of all individual commodities taken
together, whether produced under average conditions, or under conditions above
or below the average. In that case, the market-value, or social value, of the
mass of commodities — the necessary labour-time contained in them —
is determined by the value of the preponderant mean mass.</p>
<p>Suppose, on the contrary, that the total mass of the commodities in question
brought to market remains the same, while the value of the commodities produced
under less favourable conditions fails to balance out the value of commodities
produced under more favourable conditions, so that the part of the mass
produced under less favourable conditions forms a relatively weighty quantity
as compared with the average mass and with the other extreme. In that case, the
mass produced under less favourable conditions regulates the market, or social,
value. </p>
<p>Suppose, finally, that the mass of commodities produced under better than
average conditions considerably exceeds that produced under worse conditions,
and is large even compared with that produced under average conditions. In that
case, the part produced under the most favourable conditions determines the
market-value. We ignore here the overstocked market, in which the part produced
under most favourable conditions always regulates the market-price. We are not
dealing here with the market-price, in so far as it differs from the
market-value, but with the various determinations of the market-value itself.
<sup class="enote"><a href="#1">[1]</a><a id="[1]"></a></sup></p>
<p>In fact, strictly speaking (which, of course, occurs in reality only in
approximation and with a thousand modifications) the market-value of the entire
mass, regulated as it is by the average values, is in case I equal to the sum
of their individual values; although in the case of the commodities produced at
the extremes, this value is represented as an average value which is forced
upon them. Those who produce at the worst extreme must then sell their
commodities below the individual value; those producing at the best extreme
sell them above it. </p>
<p>In case II the individual lots of commodity-values produced at the two
extremes do not balance one another. Rather, the lot produced under the worse
conditions decides the issue. Strictly speaking, the average price, or the
market-value, of each individual commodity, or each aliquot part of the total
mass, would now be determined by the total value of the mass as obtained by
adding up the values of the commodities produced under different conditions,
and in accordance with the aliquot part of this total value falling to the
share of each individual commodity. The market-value thus obtained would exceed
the individual value not only of the commodities belonging to the favourable
extreme, but also of those belonging to the average lot. Yet it would still be
below the individual value of those commodities produced at the unfavourable
extreme. How close the market-value approaches, or finally coincides with, the
latter would depend entirely on the volume occupied by commodities produced at
the unfavourable extreme of the commodity sphere in question. If demand is only
slightly greater than supply, the individual value of the unfavourably produced
commodities regulates the market-price. </p>
<p>Finally, if the lot of commodities produced at the favourable extreme
occupies greater place than the other extreme, and also than the average lot,
as it does in case III, then the market-value falls below the average value.
The average value, computed by adding the sums of values at the two extremes
and at the middle, stands here below the value of the middle, which it
approaches, or vice versa, depending on the relative place occupied by the
favourable extreme. Should demand be weaker than supply, the favourably
situated part, whatever its size, makes room for itself forcibly by paring its
price down to its individual value. The market-value cannot ever coincide with
this individual value of the commodities produced under the most favourable
conditions, except when supply far exceeds demand. </p>
<p>This mode of determining market-values, which we have here outlined
<i>abstractly</i>, is promoted in the real market by competition among the
buyers, provided the demand is large enough to absorb the mass of commodities
at values so fixed. And this brings us to the other point. </p>
<p><i>Second</i>, to say that a commodity has a use-value is merely to say
that it satisfies some social want. So long as we dealt with individual
commodities only, we could assume that there was a need for a particular
commodity — its quantity already implied by its price without inquiring
further into the quantity required to satisfy this want. This quantity is,
however, of essential importance, as soon as the product of an entire branch of
production is placed on one side, and the social need for it on the other. It
then becomes necessary to consider the extent, i.e., the amount of this social
want. </p>
<p>In the foregoing determinations of market-value it was assumed that the mass
of the produced commodities is given, i.e., remains the same, and that there is
a change only in the proportions of its constituent elements, which are
produced under different conditions, and that, hence, the market-value of the
same mass of commodities is differently regulated. Suppose, this mass
corresponds in size to the usual supply, leaving aside the possibility that a
portion of the produced commodities may be temporarily withdrawn from the
market. Should demand for this mass now also remain the same, this commodity
will be sold at its market-value, no matter which of the three aforementioned
cases regulates this market-value. This mass of commodities does not merely
satisfy a need, but satisfies it to its full social extent. Should their
quantity be smaller or greater, however, than the demand for them, there will
be deviations of the market-price from the market-value. And the first
deviation is that if the supply is too small, the market-value is always
regulated by the commodities produced under the least favourable circumstances
and, if the supply is too large, always by the commodities produced under the
most favourable conditions; that therefore it is one of the extremes which
determines the market-value, in spite of the fact that in accordance with the
mere proportion of the commodity masses produced under different conditions, a
different result should obtain. If the difference between demand and the
available quantity of the product is more considerable, the market-price will
likewise be considerably above or below the market-value. Now, the difference
between the quantity of the produced commodities and that quantity of them at
which they are sold at market-value may be due to two reasons. Either the
quantity itself changes, becoming too small or too large, so that reproduction
would have taken place on a different scale than that which regulated the given
market-value. In that case, the supply changed, although demand remained the
same, and there was, therefore, relative over-production or under-production.
Or else reproduction, and thus supply, remained the same, while demand shrank
or increased, which may be due to several reasons. Although the absolute
magnitude of the supply was the same, its relative magnitude, its magnitude
relative to, or measured by, the demand, had changed. The effect is the same as
in the first case, but in the reverse direction. Finally, if changes take place
on both sides, but either in reverse directions, or, if in the same direction,
then not to the same extent, if therefore there are changes on both sides, but
these alter the former proportion between the two sides, then the final result
must always lead to one of the two above-mentioned cases.</p>
<p>The real difficulty in formulating the general definition of supply and
demand is that it seems to take on the appearance of a tautology. First
consider the supply — the product available in the market, or that which
can be delivered to it. To avoid dwelling upon useless detail, we shall here
consider only the mass annually reproduced in every given branch of production
and ignore the greater or lesser faculty possessed by the different commodities
to be withdrawn from the market and stored away for consumption, say, until
next year. This annual reproduction is expressed by a certain quantity —
in weight or numbers — depending on whether this mass of commodities is
measured in discrete elements or continuously. They are not only use-values
satisfying human wants, but these use-values are available in the market in
definite quantities. Secondly, however, this quantity of commodities has a
specific market-value, which may be expressed by a multiple of the market-value
of the commodity, or of its measure, which serves as unit. Thus, there is no
necessary connection between the quantitative volume of the commodities in the
market and their market-value, since, for instance, many commodities have a
specifically high value, and others a specifically low value, so that a given
sum of values may be represented by a very large quantity of one commodity, and
a very small quantity of another. There is only the following connection
between the quantity of the articles available in the market and the
market-value of these articles: On a given basis of labour productivity the
production of a certain quantity of articles in every particular sphere of
production requires a definite quantity of social labour-time; although this
proportion varies in different spheres of production and has no inner relation
to the usefulness of these articles or the special nature of their use-values.
Assuming all other circumstances to be equal, and a certain quantity a of some
commodity to cost b labour-time, a quantity na of the same commodity will cost
nb labour-time. Further, if society wants to satisfy some want and have an
article produced for this purpose, it must pay for it. Indeed, since
commodity-production necessitates a division of labour, society pays for this
article by devoting a portion of the available labour-time to its production.
Therefore, society buys it with a definite quantity of its disposable
labour-time. That part of society which through the division of labour happens
to employ its labour in producing this particular article, must receive an
equivalent in social labour incorporated in articles which satisfy its own
wants. However, there exists an accidental rather than a necessary connection
between the total amount of social labour applied to a social article, i.e.,
between the aliquot part of society's total labour-power allocated to producing
this article, or between the volume which the production of this article
occupies in total production, on the one hand, and the volume whereby society
seeks to satisfy the want gratified by the article in question, on the other.
Every individual article, or every definite quantity of a commodity may,
indeed, contain no more than the social labour required for its production, and
from this point of view the market-value of this entire commodity represents
only necessary labour, but if this commodity has been produced in excess of the
existing social needs, then so much of the social labour-time is squandered and
the mass of the commodity comes to represent a much smaller quantity of social
labour in the market than is actually incorporated in it. (It is only where
production is under the actual, predetermining control of society that the
latter establishes a relation between the volume of social labour-time applied
in producing definite articles, and the volume of the social want to be
satisfied by these articles.) For this reason, these commodities must be sold
below their market-value, and a portion of them may even be altogether
unsaleable. The reverse applies if the quantity of social labour employed in
the production of a certain kind of commodity is too small to meet the social
demand for that commodity. But if the quantity of social labour expended in the
production of a certain article corresponds to the social demand for that
article, so that the produced quantity corresponds to the usual scale of
reproduction and the demand remains unchanged, then the article is sold at its
market-value. The exchange, or sale, of commodities at their value is the
rational state of affairs, i.e., the natural law of their equilibrium. It is
this law that explains the deviations, and not vice versa, the deviations that
explain the law. </p>
<p>Now let us look at the other side — the demand. </p>
<p>Commodities are bought either as means of production or means of subsistence
to enter productive or individual consumption. It does not alter matters that
some commodities may serve both purposes. There is, then, a demand for them on
the part of producers (here capitalists, since we have assumed that means of
production have been transformed into capital) and of consumers. Both appear at
first sight to presuppose a given quantity of social want on the side of
demand, corresponding on the other side to a definite quantity of social output
in the various lines of production. If the cotton industry is to accomplish its
annual reproduction on a given scale, it must have the usual supply of cotton,
and, other circumstances remaining the same, an additional amount of cotton
corresponding to the annual extension of reproduction caused by the
accumulation of capital. This is equally true with regard to means of
subsistence. The working-class must find at least the same quantity of
necessities on hand if it is to continue living in its accustomed average way,
although they may be more or less differently distributed among the different
kinds of commodities. Moreover, there must be an additional quantity to allow
for the annual increase of population. The same, with more or less
modification, applies to other classes. </p>
<p>It would seem, then, that there is on the side of demand a certain magnitude
of definite social wants which require for their satisfaction a definite
quantity of a commodity on the market. But quantitatively, the definite social
wants are very elastic and changing. Their fixedness is only apparent. If the
means of subsistence were cheaper, or money-wages higher, the labourers would
buy more of them, and a greater social need would arise for them, leaving aside
the paupers, etc., whose demand is even below the narrowest limits of their
physical wants. On the other hand, if cotton were cheaper, for example, the
capitalists' demand for it would increase, more additional capital would be
thrown into the cotton industry, etc. We must never forget that the demand for
productive consumption is, under our assumption, a demand of the capitalist,
whose essential purpose is the production of surplus-value, so that he produces
a particular commodity to this sole end. Still, this does not hinder the
capitalist, so long as he appears in the market as a buyer of, say, cotton,
from representing the need for this cotton, just as it is immaterial to the
seller of cotton whether the buyer converts it into shirting or gun-cotton, or
whether he intends to turn it into wads for his own, and the world's, ears. But
this does exert a considerable influence on the kind of buyer the capitalist
is. His demand for cotton is substantially modified by the fact that it
disguises his real need for making profit. The limits within which the need for
commodities in the <i>market</i>, the demand, differs quantitatively from the
<i>actual social need</i>, naturally vary considerably for different
commodities; what I mean is the difference between the demanded quantity of
commodities and the quantity which would have been in demand at other
money-prices or other money or living conditions of the buyers. </p>
<p>Nothing is easier than to realise the inconsistencies of demand and supply,
and the resulting deviation of market-prices from market-values. The real
difficulty consists in determining what is meant by the equation of supply and
demand. </p>
<p>Supply and demand coincide when their mutual proportions are such that the
mass of commodities of a definite line of production can be sold at their
market-value, neither above nor below it. That is the first thing we hear. </p>
<p>The second is this: If commodities are sold at their market-values, supply
and demand coincide. </p>
<p>If supply equals demand, they cease to act, and for this very reason
commodities are sold at their market-values. Whenever two forces operate
equally in opposite directions, they balance one another, exert no outside
influence, and any phenomena taking place in these circumstances must be
explained by causes other than the effect of these two forces. If supply and
demand balance one another, they cease to explain anything, do not affect
market-values, and therefore leave us so much more in the dark about the
reasons why the market-value is expressed in just this sum of money and no
other. It is evident that the real inner laws of capitalist production cannot
be explained by the interaction of supply and demand (quite aside from a deeper
analysis of these two social motive forces, which would be out of place here),
because these laws cannot be observed in their pure state, until supply and
demand cease to act, i.e., are equated. In reality, supply and demand never
coincide, or, if they do, it is by mere accident, hence scientifically = 0, and
to be regarded as not having occurred. But political economy assumes that
supply and demand coincide with one another. Why? To be able to study phenomena
in their fundamental relations, in the form corresponding to their conception,
that is, is to study them independent of the appearances caused by the movement
of supply and demand. The other reason is to find the actual tendencies of
their movements and to some extent to record them. Since the inconsistencies
are of an antagonistic nature, and since they continually succeed one another,
they balance out one another through their opposing movements, and their mutual
contradiction. Since, therefore, supply and demand never equal one another in
any given case, their differences follow one another in such a way — and
the result of a deviation in one direction is that it calls forth a deviation
in the opposite direction — that supply and demand are always equated
when the whole is viewed over a certain period, but only as an average of past
movements, and only as the continuous movement of their contradiction. In this
way, the market-prices which have deviated from the market-values adjust
themselves, as viewed from the standpoint of their average number, to equal the
market-values, in that deviations from the latter cancel each other as plus and
minus. And this average is not merely of theoretical, but also of practical
importance to capital, whose investment is calculated on the fluctuations and
compensations of a more or less fixed period. </p>
<p>On the one hand, the relation of demand and supply, therefore, only explains
the deviations of market-prices from market-values. On the other, it explains
the tendency to eliminate these deviations, i.e., to eliminate the effect of
the relation of demand and supply. (Such exceptions as commodities which have a
price without having a value are not considered here.) Supply and demand may
eliminate the effect caused by their difference in many different ways. For
instance, if the demand, and consequently the market-price, fall, capital may
be withdrawn, thus causing supply to shrink. It may also be that the
market-value itself shrinks and balances with the market-price as a result of
inventions which reduce the necessary labour-time. Conversely, if the demand
increases, and consequently the market-price rises above the market-value, this
may lead to too much capital flowing into this line of production and
production may swell to such an extent that the market-price will even fall
below the market-value. Or, it may lead to a price increase, which cuts the
demand. In some lines of production it may also bring about a rise in the
market-value itself for a shorter or longer period, with a portion of the
desired products having to be produced under worse conditions during this
period. </p>
<p>Supply and demand determine the market-price, and so does the market-price,
and the market-value in the further analysis, determine supply and demand. This
is obvious in the case of demand, since it moves in a direction opposite to
prices, swelling when prices fall, and vice versa. But this is also true of
supply. Because the prices of means of production incorporated in the offered
commodities determine the demand for these means of production, and thus the
supply of commodities whose supply embraces the demand for these means of
production. The prices of cotton are determinants in the supply of cotton
goods. </p>
<p>To this confusion — determining prices through demand and supply, and,
at the same time, determining supply and demand through prices — must be
added that demand determines supply, just as supply determines demand, and
production determines the market, as well as the market determines production.
<sup class="enote"><a href="#2">[2] </a><a id="[2]"></a></sup></p>
<p>Even the ordinary economist (see footnote) agrees that the proportion
between supply and demand may vary in consequence of a change in the
market-value of commodities, without a change being brought about in demand or
supply by extraneous circumstances. Even he must admit that, whatever the
market-value, supply and demand must coincide in order for it to be
established. In other words, the ratio of supply to demand does not explain the
market-value, but conversely, the latter rather explains the fluctuations of
supply and demand. The author of the <i>Observations </i>continues after the
passage quoted in the footnote:</p>
<p class="indentb">"This proportion" (between demand and supply), "however, if
we still mean by 'demand' and 'natural price', what we meant just now, when
referring to Adam Smith, must always be a proportion of equality; for it is
only when the supply is equal to the effectual demand, that is, to that demand
which will neither more nor less than pay the natural price, that the natural
price is in fact paid; consequently, there may be two very different natural
prices, at different times, for the same commodity, and yet the proportion,
which the supply bears to the demand, be in both cases the same, namely, the
proportion of equality." </p>
<p>It is admitted, then, that with two different natural prices of the same
commodity, at different times, demand and supply are always able to, and must,
balance one another if the commodity is to be sold at its natural price in both
instances. Since there is no difference in the ratio of supply to demand in
either case, but a difference in the magnitude of the natural price itself, it
follows that this price is obviously determined independently of demand and
supply, and thus that it can least of all be determined by them. </p>
<p>For a commodity to be sold at its market-value, i.e., proportionally to the
necessary social labour contained in it, the total quantity of social labour
used in producing the total mass of this commodity must correspond to the
quantity of the social want for it, i.e., the effective social want.
Competition, the fluctuations of market-prices which correspond to the
fluctuations of demand and supply, tend continually to reduce to this scale the
total quantity of labour devoted to each kind of commodity. </p>
<p>The proportion of supply and demand recapitulates, first, the relation of
use-value to exchange-value, of commodity to money, and of buyer to seller;
and, second, that of producer to consumer, although both of them may be
represented by third parties, the merchants. In considering buyer and seller,
it suffices to counterpose them individually in order to present their
relationship. Three individuals are enough for the complete metamorphosis of a
commodity, and therefore for the process of sale and purchase taken as a whole.
A converts his commodity into the money of B, to whom he sells his commodity,
and reconverts his money again into commodities, when he uses it to make
purchases from C; the whole process takes place among these three. Further, in
the study of money it had been assumed that the commodities are sold at their
values because there was absolutely no reason to consider prices divergent from
values, it being merely a matter of changes of form which commodities undergo
in their transformation into money and their reconversion from money into
commodities. As soon as a commodity has been sold and a new commodity bought
with the receipts, we have before us the entire metamorphosis, and to this
process as such it is immaterial whether the price of the commodity lies above
or below its value. The value of the commodity remains important as a basis,
because the concept of money cannot be developed on any other foundation, and
price, in its general meaning, is but value in the form of money. At any rate,
it is assumed in the study of money as a medium of circulation that there is
not just one metamorphosis of a certain commodity. It is rather the social
interrelation of these metamorphoses which is studied. Only thus do we arrive
at the circulation of money and the development of its function as a medium of
circulation. But however important this connection may be for the conversion of
money into a circulating medium, and for its resulting change of form, it is of
no moment to the transaction between individual buyers and sellers. </p>
<p>In the case of supply and demand, however, the supply is equal to the sum of
sellers, or producers, of a certain kind of commodity, and the demand equals
the sum of buyers or consumers (both productive and individual) of the same
kind of commodity. The sums react on one another as units, as aggregate forces.
The individual counts here only as part of a social force, as an atom of the
mass, and it is in this form that competition brings out the
<i>social</i>character of production and consumption. </p>
<p>The side of competition which happens for the moment to be weaker is also
the side in which the individual acts independently of, and often directly
against, the mass of his competitors, and precisely in this manner is the
dependence of one upon the other impressed upon them, while the stronger side
acts always more or less as a united whole against its antagonist. If the
demand for this particular kind of commodity is greater than the supply, one
buyer outbids another — within certain limits — and so raises the
price of the commodity for all of them above the market-value, while on the
other hand the sellers unite in trying to sell at a high market-price. If,
conversely, the supply exceeds the demand, one begins to dispose of his goods
at a cheaper rate and the others must follow, while the buyers unite in their
efforts to depress the market-price as much as possible below the market-value.
The common interest is appreciated by each only so long as he gains more by it
than without it. And unity of action ceases the moment one or the other side
becomes the weaker, when each tries to extricate himself on his own as
advantageously as he possibly can. Again, if one produces more cheaply and can
sell more goods, thus possessing himself of a greater place in the market by
selling below the current market-price, or market-value, he will do so, and
will thereby begin a movement which gradually compels the others to introduce
the cheaper mode of production, and one which reduces the socially necessary
labour to a new, and lower, level. If one side has the advantage, all belonging
to it gain. It is as though they exerted their common monopoly. If one side is
weaker, then one may try on his own hook to become the stronger (for instance,
one who works with lower costs of production), or at least to get off as
lightly as possible, and in such cases each for himself and the devil take the
hindmost, although his actions affect not only himself, but also all his boon
companions. <sup class="enote"><a href="#3">[3]</a><a id="[3]"></a></sup></p>
<p>Demand and supply imply the conversion of value into market-value, and so
far as they proceed on a capitalist basis, so far as the commodities are
products of capital, they are based on capitalist production processes, i.e.,
on quite different relationships than the mere purchase and sale of goods. Here
it is not a question of the formal conversion of the value of commodities into
prices, i.e., not of a mere change of form. It is a question of definite
deviations in quantity of the market-prices from the market-values, and,
further, from the prices of production. In simple purchase and sale it suffices
to have the producers of commodities as such counterposed to one another. In
further analysis supply and demand presuppose the existence of different
classes and sections of classes which divide the total revenue of a society and
consume it among themselves as revenue, and, therefore, make up the demand
created by revenue. While on the other hand it requires an insight into the
over-all structure of the capitalist production process for an understanding of
the supply and demand created among themselves by producers as such. </p>
<p>Under capitalist production it is not merely a matter of obtaining an equal
mass of value in another form — be it that of money or some other
commodity — for a mass of values thrown into circulation in the form of a
commodity, but it is rather a matter of realising as much surplus-value, or
profit, on capital advanced for production, as any other capital of the same
magnitude, or <i>pro rata</i> to its magnitude in whichever line it is
applied. It is, therefore, a matter, at least as a minimum, of selling the
commodities at prices which yield the average profit, i.e., at prices of
production. In this form capital becomes conscious of itself as a <i>social
power</i> in which every capitalist participates proportionally to his share
in the total social capital. </p>
<p>First, capitalist production is in itself indifferent to the particular
use-value, and distinctive features of any commodity it produces. In every
sphere of production it is only concerned with producing surplus-value, and
appropriating a certain quantity of unpaid labour incorporated in the product
of labour. And it is likewise in the nature of the wage-labour subordinated by
capital that it is indifferent to the specific character of its labour and must
submit to being transformed in accordance with the requirements of capital and
to being transferred from one sphere of production to another. </p>
<p>Second, one sphere of production is, in fact, just as good or just as bad as
another. Every one of them yields the same profit, and every one of them would
be useless if the commodities it produced did not satisfy some social need. </p>
<p>Now, if the commodities are sold at their values, then, as we have shown,
very different rates of profit arise in the various spheres of production,
depending on the different organic composition of the masses of capital
invested in them. But capital withdraws from a sphere with a low rate of profit
and invades others, which yield a higher profit. Through this incessant outflow
and influx, or, briefly, through its distribution among the various spheres,
which depends on how the rate of profit falls here and rises there, it creates
such a ratio of supply to demand that the average profit in the various spheres
of production becomes the same, and values are, therefore, converted into
prices of production. Capital succeeds in this equalisation, to a greater or
lesser degree, depending on the extent of capitalist development in the given
nation; i.e., on the extent the conditions in the country in question are
adapted for the capitalist mode of production. With the progress of capitalist
production, it also develops its own conditions and subordinates to its
specific character and its immanent laws all the social prerequisites on which
the production process is based. </p>
<p>The incessant equilibration of constant divergences is accomplished so much
more quickly, 1) the more mobile the capital, i.e., the more easily it can be
shifted from one sphere and from one place to another; 2) the more quickly
labour-power can be transferred from one sphere to another and from one
production locality to another. The first condition implies complete freedom of
trade within the society and the removal of all monopolies with the exception
of the natural ones, those, that is, which naturally arise out of the
capitalist mode of production. It implies, furthermore, the development of the
credit system, which concentrates the inorganic mass of the disposable social
capital vis-a-vis the individual capitalist. Finally, it implies the
subordination of the various spheres of production to the control of
capitalists. This last implication is included in our premises, since we
assumed that it was a matter of converting values into prices of production in
all capitalistically exploited spheres of production. But this equilibration
itself runs into greater obstacles, whenever numerous and large spheres of
production not operated on a capitalist basis (such as soil cultivation by
small farmers), filter in between the capitalist enterprises and become linked
with them. A great density of population is another requirement.— The
second condition implies the abolition of all laws preventing the labourers
from transferring from one sphere of production to another and from one local
centre of production to another; indifference of the labourer to the nature of
his labour; the greatest possible reduction of labour in all spheres of
production to simple labour; the elimination of all vocational prejudices among
labourers; and last but not least, a subjugation of the labourer to the
capitalist mode of production. Further reference to this belongs to a special
analysis of competition. </p>
<p>It follows from the foregoing that in each particular sphere of production
the individual capitalist, as well as the capitalists as a whole, take direct
part in the exploitation of the total working-class by the totality of capital
and in the degree of that exploitation, not only out of general class sympathy,
but also for direct economic reasons. For, assuming all other conditions
— among them the value of the total advanced constant capital — to
be given, the average rate of profit depends on the intensity of exploitation
of the sum total of labour by the sum total of capital. </p>
<p>The average profit coincides with the average surplus-value produced for
each 100 of capital, and so far as the surplus-value is concerned the foregoing
statements apply as a matter of course. In the case of the average profit the
value of the advanced capital becomes an additional element determining the
rate of profit. In fact, the direct interest taken by the capitalist, or the
capital, of any individual sphere of production in the exploitation of the
labourers who are directly employed is confined to making an extra gain, a
profit exceeding the average, either through exceptional overwork, or reduction
of the wage below the average, or through the exceptional productivity of the
labour employed. Aside from this, a capitalist who would not in his line of
production employ any variable capital, and therefore any labourer (in reality
an exaggerated assumption), would nonetheless be as much interested in the
exploitation of the working-class by capital, and would derive his profit quite
as much from unpaid surplus-labour, as, say, a capitalist who would employ only
variable capital (another exaggeration), and who would thus invest his entire
capital in wages. But the degree of exploitation of labour depends on the
average intensity of labour if the working-day is given, and on the length of
the working-day if the intensity of exploitation is given. The degree of
exploitation of labour determines the rate of surplus-value, and therefore the
mass of surplus-value for a given total mass of variable capital, and
consequently the magnitude of the profit. The individual capitalist, as
distinct from his sphere as a whole, has the same special interest in
exploiting the labourers he personally employs as the capital of a particular
sphere, as distinct from the total social capital, has in exploiting the
labourers directly employed in that sphere. </p>
<p>On the other hand, every particular sphere of capital, and every individual
capitalist, have the same interest in the productivity of the social labour
employed by the sum total of capital. For two things depend on this
productivity: First, the mass of use-values in which the average profit is
expressed; and this is doubly important, since this average profit serves as a
fund for the accumulation of new capital and as a fund for revenue to be spent
for consumption. Second, the value of the total capital invested (constant and
variable), which, the amount of surplus-value, or profit, for the whole
capitalist class being given, determines the rate of profit, or the profit on a
certain quantity of capital. The special productivity of labour in any
particular sphere, or in any individual enterprise of this sphere, is of
interest only to those capitalists who are directly engaged in it, since it
enables that particular sphere, vis-a-vis the total capital, or that individual
capitalist, vis-a-vis his sphere, to make an extra profit. </p>
<p>Here, then, we have a mathematically precise proof why capitalists form a
veritable freemason society vis-a-vis the whole working-class, while there is
little love lost between them in competition among themselves. </p>
<p>The price of production includes the average profit. We call it price of
production. It is really what Adam Smith calls <i>natural price</i>, Ricardo
calls <i>price of production</i>, or <i>cost of production</i>, and the
physiocrats call <i>prix nécessaire</i>, because in the long run it is a
prerequisite of supply, of the reproduction of commodities in every individual
sphere. But none of them has revealed the difference between price of
production and value. We can well understand why the same economists who oppose
determining the value of commodities by labour-time, i.e., by the quantity of
labour contained in them, why they always speak of prices of production as
centres around which market-prices fluctuate. They can afford to do it because
the price of production is an utterly external and <i>prima facie</i>
meaningless form of the value of commodities, a form as it appears in
competition, therefore in the mind of the vulgar capitalist, and consequently
in that of the vulgar economist. </p>
<p> Our analysis has revealed how the market-value (and everything said
concerning it applies with appropriate modifications to the price of
production) embraces a surplus-profit for those who produce in any particular
sphere of production under the most favourable conditions. With the exception
of crises, and of overproduction in general, this applies to all market-prices,
no matter how much they may deviate from market-values or market-prices of
production. For the market-price signifies that the same price is paid for
commodities of the same kind, although they may have been produced under very
different individual conditions and hence may have different cost-prices. (We
do not speak at this point of any surplus-profits due to monopolies in the
usual sense of the term, whether natural or artificial.)</p>
<p>A surplus-profit may also arise if certain spheres of production are in a
position to evade the conversion of the values of their commodities into prices
of production, and thus the reduction of their profits to the average profit.
We shall devote more attention to the further modifications of these two forms
of surplus-profit in the part dealing with ground-rent.</p>

<p class="information"><span class="term"><a href="#[1]" id="1">1.</a></span>
The controversy between Storch and Ricardo with regard to ground-rent (a
controversy pertaining only to the subject; in fact, the two opponents pay no
attention to one another), whether the market-value (or rather what they call
market-price and price of production respectively) was regulated by the
commodities produced under unfavourable conditions (Ricardo) [<i>On the
Principles of Political Economy, and Taxation, Third edition, London, 1821, pp.
661. — Ed. </i>], or by those produced under favourable conditions
(Storch) [<i>Cours d'economie politique, ou exposition des principes,
qudeterminent la prosperite des nations, tome II, St.-Petersbourg, 1815, pp.
78-79. — Ed.</i> ], resolves itself in the final analysis in that both
are right and both wrong, and that both of them have failed to consider the
average case. Compare Corbet [<i>An Inquiry into the Causes and Modes of the
Wealth of Individuals, London, 1841, pp. 42-44. — Ed. </i>] on the cases
in which the price is regulated by commodities produced under the most
favourable conditions. — "It is not meant to be asserted by him (Ricardo)
that two particular lots of two different articles, as a hat and a pair of
shoes, exchange with one another when those two particular lots were produced
by equal quantities of labour. By 'commodity' we must here understand the
'description of commodity', not a particular individual hat, pair of shoes etc.
The whole labour which produces all the hats in England is to be considered, to
this purpose, as divided among all the hats. This seems to me not to have been
expressed at first, and in the general statement of this doctrine."
(<i>Observations on Certain Verbal Disputes in Political Economy, etc.,
London, 1821, pp. 53-54.</i>)</p>
<p class="information"><span class="term"><a href="#[2]" id="2">2.</a></span>
The following subtility is sheer nonsense: "Where the quantity of wages,
capital, and land, required to produce an article, are become different from
what they were, that which Adam Smith calls the natural price of it is also
different, and that price, which was previously its natural price becomes, with
reference to this alteration, its market-price; because, though neither the
supply, nor the quantity wanted, may have been changed" — both of them
change here, just because the market-value, or, in the case of Adam Smith, the
price of production, changes in consequence of a change of value — "that
supply is not now exactly enough for those persons who are able and willing to
pay what is now the cost of production, but is either greater or less than
that; so that the proportion between the supply and what is with reference to
the new cost of production the effectual demand, is different from what it was.
An alteration in the rate of supply will then take place if there is no
obstacle in the way of it, and at last bring the commodity to its new natural
price. It may then seem good to some persons to say that as the commodity gets
to its natural price by an alteration in its supply, the natural price is as
much owing to one proportion between the demand and supply, as the market-price
is to another; and consequently, that the natural price, just as much as the
market-price, depends on the proportion that demand and supply bear to each
other." ("The great principle of demand and supply is called into action to
determine what A. Smith calls natural prices as well as market-prices." —
Malthus.) [<i>Principles of Political Economy, London, 1820, p. 75. —
Ed</i>.] (<i>Observations on Certain Verbal Disputes, etc.,</i> London,
1821, pp. 60-61.) The good man does not grasp the fact that it is precisely the
change in the cost of production, and thus in the value which caused a change
in the demand, in the present case, and thus in the proportion between demand
and supply, and that this change in the demand may bring about a change in the
supply. This would prove just the reverse of what our good thinker wants to
prove. It would prove that the change in the cost of production is by no means
due to the proportion of demand and supply, but rather regulates this
proportion." </p>
<p class="information"><span class="term"><a href="#[3]" id="3">3</a>.</span>
"If each man of a class could never have more than a given share, or aliquot
part, of the gains and possessions of the whole, he would readily combine to
raise the gain"; (he does it as soon as the proportion of demand to supply
permits it ) "this is monopoly. But where each man thinks that he may anyway
increase the absolute amount of his own share, though by a process which
lessens the whole amount, he will often do it; this is competition." (<i>An
Inquiry into Those Principles Respecting the Nature of Demand, etc,</i>,
London, 1821, p. 105.) </p>

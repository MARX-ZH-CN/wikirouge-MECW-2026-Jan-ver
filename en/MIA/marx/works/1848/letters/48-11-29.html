<h4>Cologne, 29 November 1848</h4>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>The papers have been sent to you. If this was not done sooner the fault lies with that jackass Korff who, because I was overworked, a circumstance aggravated by repeated summonses, has so far failed to carry out my orders.</p>
<p>In the meantime remain in Berne. I shall write to you as soon as you can come. Seal your letters better. One of them had been opened, as I indicated in the paper, without, of course, mentioning your name. <span class="context">[Marx, ‘Letters Opened']</span></p>
<p>Write in detail about <i>Proudhon</i> and, since your geography is good, about the dirty business in Hungary (nations swarming like bees). <span class="context">[Engels, Proudhon and The Magyar Struggle]</span> Don’t forget me <span class="context">[i.e., The Poverty of Philosophy]</span> in the piece on Proudhon, since our articles are reprinted by a great many French newspapers.</p>
<p>Write something, too, attacking the Federal Republic, to which end Switzerland provides the best opportunity. <span class="context">[Engels, The National Council]</span></p>
<p>K. Heinzen has published his old trashy piece attacking us. <span class="context">[K. Heinzen, Die Helden des teutschen Kommunismus, 1848]</span></p>
<p>Our paper continues to stand by the principle of <i>émeute</i> <span class="context">[uprising]</span>, but despite all my summonses in court, it has succeeded in sailing clear of the <i>Code pénal</i>.<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#241" target=_blank>[241]</a></sup> It is now very much en vogue. We are also issuing posters daily.<sup class="enote"> <a href="../../cw/volume38/footnote.html#242" target=_blank>[242]</a></sup> <i>La révolution marche</i>. Write diligently.</p>
<p>I have devised an infallible plan for extracting money from your old man, as we now have none. Write me a begging letter (as crude as possible), in which you retail your past vicissitudes, but in such a way that I can pass it on to your mother. The old man’s beginning to get the wind up.</p>
<p>I hope to see you again soon. </p>
<p>Your<br>
Marx</p>

<p><i>Berne</i>, November 20. I have just heard from officials of the Federal War Department that <i>the German Central Authority is reported to have declared war on Switzerland</i>.<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume08/footnote.html#65" target=_blank>[65]</a></sup> The courier arrived yesterday evening, and the <i>Vorort</i> was said to have gone into session at 11 o'clock the same evening. Measures had already been taken for serious war preparations. It was stated further that <i>50,000 imperial troops were concentrating on the Swiss frontier</i> to begin hostilities.</p>
<p>I am passing this news to you exactly as I heard it. I myself do not believe it, although the source is reliable. I would not credit even the Imperial Government with <i>such</i> lunacy.</p>

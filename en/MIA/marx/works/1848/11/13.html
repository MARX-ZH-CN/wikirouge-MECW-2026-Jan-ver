<p class="fst"><i>E. Girardin</i> is pitiable in his apologia for the imperialistic cretin <i>Louis Napoleon</i>, the “<i>little constable</i>” <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume08/footnote.html#38" target=_blank>[38]</a></sup> ; he is likeable in his attacks on <i>Cavaignac</i>, the warrior hero of M. Marrast. Since November 7 he has been publishing in consecutive issues a philippic against the <i>hero of the European bourgeoisie</i>, which has fallen in love with his Arabian nightcap. <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume08/footnote.html#39" target=_blank>[39]</a></sup> Perfidious as this bourgeoisie is, it has sacrificed him to the <i>Sipehsalar </i><span class="context">[supreme commander]</span><i> Jellachich, </i>who is now the <i>lion</i> of the European hucksters.</p>
<p>We give our readers in full the <i>acte d'accusation</i> made by <i>La Presse. </i>In contrast to all European newspapers of great or small format, we have conceived the <i>June revolution</i> in a way that history has confirmed. We insist on coming back from time to time to its chief factors and chief <i>dramatis personae</i>, since the <i>June revolution is the centre</i> around which the European revolution and counter-revolution revolve. The distance from the June revolution, as we stated at the time when it was taking place, marked the zenith of counter-revolution, which had to make its tour of Europe. The return to the June revolution is the real beginning of the European revolution. Therefore, back to <i>Cavaignac</i>, to the <i>inventor of the state of siege.</i></p>

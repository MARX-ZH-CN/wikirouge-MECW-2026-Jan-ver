<p>
M. Proudhon has the misfortune of being peculiarly
misunderstood in Europe. In France, he has the right to be a bad economist,
because he is reputed to be a good German philosopher. In Germany, he has
the right to be a bad philosopher, because he is reputed to be one of the
ablest French economists. Being both German and economist at the same time,
we desire to protest against this double error.

<p>The reader will understand that in this thankless task we have
often had to abandon our criticism of M. Proudhon in order to criticize
German philosophy, and at the same time to give some observations on political
economy.

M. Proudhon's work is not just a treatise on political economy, an ordinary
book; it is a bible. "Mysteries", "Secrets Wrested from the Bosom of God",
"Revelations" – it lacks nothing. But as prophets are discussed nowadays
more conscientiously than profane writers, the reader must resign himself
to going with us through the arid and gloomy eruditions of "Genesis", in
order to ascend later, with M. Proudhon, into the ethereal and fertile
realm of <i>super-socialism</i>. (See Proudhon, <i>Philosophy of Poverty</i>, Prologue,
p.III, line 20.)

<h4>London, 8 December 1857<br>
9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, Hampstead</h4>
<p>Dear Schramm,</p>
<p>Write soon and tell us how Jersey suits you. I did not see Engels when he passed through London on his return journey because he gave me the wrong time for our meeting at the <strong>railway station</strong>. Did that ass Reventlow reply? Not that I suppose there’s anything at all to the whole affair, since in any case these <strong>Americans</strong> are incapable of paying just now; I only ask because of the <strong>behaviour</strong> of this mighty hero. And how about Mr Faucher? Has he paid up yet? That <strong>crazy</strong> <i>Berlinois</i> <strong>grows from day to day stupider. Witness the foreign news of <i>The Morning Star</i></strong>, a name that bears a certain analogy with <i>lucus a non lucendo</i>. In fact the entire English press gets worse every day, even without German assistance. Quite apart from the seismic effects of the <strong>general crisis</strong> which must delight every connoisseur, it is truly a relief when one is no longer forced to listen every day to the <strong>English self-laudations as to the ‘bravery’ of ‘their English in India’.</strong> It was really getting on one’s nerves, * this overtrading in other people’s courage on the part of the English paterfamilias and penny-a-liner who lives quietly at home and is uncommonly averse to anything threatening him with the remotest chance of obtaining military glory *.</p>
<p>Apart from the family circle, I am now pretty well cut off here. I seldom see my few acquaintances nor, on the whole, is this any great loss. The life you lead in Jersey can hardly be much quieter. I fear that as time goes on you will weary of your stay, or have you struck up acquaintanceships <strong>of any kind</strong>? True, Harney is <strong>so far</strong> quite a companionable fellow, but <i>toujours perdrix</i> is, of course, apt to pall. I hope to see you again in the spring, provided you don’t move further south. In any case <strong>drop one or two lines</strong>.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i>.</p>

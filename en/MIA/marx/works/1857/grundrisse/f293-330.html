<p class="title">Marx's <i>Grundrisse</i>: Footnotes</p>
<p class="fst"><span class="term"><a id="pagenote323"></a><a id="pagenote305"></a>*</span> What is <i>productive labour</i> and what is not, a point very much disputed back and forth since Adam Smith made this distinction, [Ed.: see Adam Smith, <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, Vol. II, pp. 355-85.] has to emerge from the dissection of the various aspects of capital itself. <i>Productive labour</i> is only that which produces <i>capital</i>. Is it not crazy, asks e.g. (or at least something similar) Mr Senior, that the piano maker is a productive worker, but not the piano player, although obviously the piano would be absurd without the piano player? [Ed: See Senior, <i>Principes fondamentaux</i>, pp. 197-206.] But this is exactly the case. The piano maker reproduces capital; the pianist only exchanges his labour for revenue. But doesn't the pianist produce music and satisfy our musical ear, does he not even to a certain extent produce the latter? He does indeed: his labour produces something; but that does not make it <i>productive labour</i> in the <i>economic sense</i>; no more than the labour of the madman who produces delusions is productive. <i>Labour becomes productive only by producing its own opposite.</i> Other economists therfore allow the so-called unproductive worker to be productive indirectly. For example, the pianist stimulates production; partly by giving a more decisive, lively tone to our individuality, and also in the ordinary sense of awakening a new need for the satisfaction of which additional energy becomes expended in direct material production. This already admits that only such labour is productive as produces capital; hence that labour which does not do this, regardless of how useful it may be—it may just as well be harmful—is not productive for capitalization, is hence unproductive labour. Other economists say that the difference between productive and unproductive applies not to production but to consumption. Quite the contrary. The producer of tobacco is productive, although the consumption of tobacco is unproductive. Production for unproductive consumption is quite as productive as that for productive consumption; always assuming that it produces or reproduces capital. '<i>Productive labourer he that directly augments his master's wealth,</i>' Malthus therefore says, quite correctly (IX,40) [Ed: see Malthus, <i>Principles of Political Economy</i>, p. 47, footnote by the editor, William Otter, Bp of Chichester.]; correct at least in one aspect. The expression is too abstract, since in this formulation it holds also for the slave. The master's wealth, in relation to the worker, is the form of wealth itself in its relation to labour, namely capital. Productive labourer he that directly augments capital.</p>

Our reconstruction is based on a comparison with the passage on p.310 where a distinction is drawn between 'capital in the process of its becoming' and 'the later relations' or 'the specific form in which capital is posited at a <i>certain</i> point'. Marx is repeating this distinction here, but in a different manner.</p>

<p class="fst"><span class="term"><a id="Pagenote323"></a>*</span> One of Mr Bastiat's tremendous profundities is that <i>wage labour</i> is an inessential, only formal form, a form of association, which, <i>as such</i>, has nothing to do with the economic relation of labour and capital. If, he says, the workers were rich enough to be able to await the completion and sale of the product, then wages, wage labour, would not hinder them from making as advantageous a contract with their capitalist as their capitalist makes with another capitalist. Thus the evil lies not in the wage form, but in conditions independent of it. That these conditions are themselves the <i>wage condition</i> naturally does not occur to him. If the workers were capitalists at the same time, then indeed they would relate to non-working capital not as working workers, but as working capitalists—i.e. not in the form of wage-laborers. That is why wages and profit are <i>essentially</i> the same for him as <i>profit</i> and <i>interest</i>. This he calls the <i>harmony of economic relations</i>, namely that only <i>seemingly</i> economic relations exist, but in fact, in essence, there exists only one relation, that of simple exchange. The <i>essential</i> forms therefore appear to him as <i>lacking content</i>, i.e. not as real forms.</p>

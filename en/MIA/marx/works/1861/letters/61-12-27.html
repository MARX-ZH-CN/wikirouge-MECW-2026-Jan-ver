<h4>[London,] 27 December 1861</h4>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>When the outside world first began to ‘dun’ me, I wrote — since I didn’t want to be always pestering you — not only to my mother and other relations, but also to Siebel. Now that young man, as I see from his letter, has again written to you. Consider the matter as <i>non avenue</i>.</p>
<p>I am extremely vexed that you should have had to give Dronke an <strong>I.O.U.</strong> for my sake. Originally, he promised to arrange the matter in less onerous a form and to give longer <strong>terms</strong>.</p>
<p>I don’t yet know quite how I am to weather this crisis. Whatever happens — since otherwise it would be plainly impossible — I shall write to <strong>my landlord</strong> and tell him that he cannot be paid <i>now, </i>that I intend to give him a bill, etc.</p>
<p>The court case is also going wrong. Since the point at issue turns on <strong>partnership, my lawyer</strong> considers it necessary — if I am not to be made to pay the £20 — that the case be removed from the <strong>Sheriff’s Court</strong> and taken before a <strong>Superior Court</strong>. I am due to appear at the <strong>Sheriff’s Court</strong> on January 3rd. My mistake lay in not having concluded a <i>written </i>contract with A. Petsch. Sidney, my attorney, believes I should be pretty safe in the <strong>Superior Court</strong>.</p>
<p>The rotten <i>Presse</i> is printing barely half my articles. They're jackasses. I wonder how they propose to pay, whether I'm expected to write individual articles on ‘spec’, or what?</p>
<p>In the meantime, may I wish you in advance every happiness for the New Year. If it’s anything like the old one, I, for my part, would sooner consign it to the devil.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i>.</p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. M.</p>

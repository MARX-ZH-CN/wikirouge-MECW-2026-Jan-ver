<p class="fst">I. and II. <i>Status of Savagery </i>and <i>Lower Status of Barbarism, </i>these <i>two ethnical Periods </i>cover at least fourfifths of mankind’s entire existence on Earth.</p>
<p>In the Lower Status, the higher attributes of mankind begin to develop: <i>personal dignity, eloquence, religious sensibility, rectitude, manliness </i>and <i>courage, </i>now <i>common traits of character; </i>but there was also <i>cruelty, treachery </i>and <i>fanaticism</i>. Element worship in religion, with a dim conception of personal gods, and of a <i>Great Spirit, rude verse-making, joint tenement houses, </i>and <i>bread from maize </i>belong to this period. It produced also <i>syndiasmian family </i>and <i>confederacy of tribes, organised into phratries and gentes. </i>The <i>imagination, </i>that great faculty so largely contributing to the elevation of mankind, was <i>now producing an unwritten literature of myths, legends and traditions, </i>already become a powerful stimulus upon the race.</p>

<h3>Greek Tragedy</h3>

<p class="fst"><i>The Turanian system of relations</i> (<i>Asia, Africa, Australia</i>)<i>* </i>corresponding to <i>the Ganovanian </i>in <i>America </i>must have also prevailed among <i>Greek and Latin tribes </i>in the same development period<i>. One characteristic of this</i>: the<i> children of brothers </i>are themselves <i>brothers and sisters</i>, and as such not intermarriable; the <i>children of sisters are similarly </i>related and come<i> under the same prohibition. </i>If Bachofen finds these punaluan marriages <i>lawless, </i>then a man from that period would find <i>most present marriages </i>between <i>near and distant cousins</i>, be it<i> on the father’s side or the mother’s side, incestuous, namely as marriages </i>between <i>consanguineous </i>brothers and sisters. This explains the legend of <i>the Danaides</i> (<i>on which Eschylus bases his Supplices</i>).</p>
<p><i>Danaus and AEgyptus were brothers </i>and descendants of the Argive<i> Io. Danaus </i>had<i> fifty daughters </i>by different wives and <i>AEgyptus fifty sons; </i>the latter sought the first in marriage; these, <i>according to the Turanian system, </i>were<i> brothers and sisters, </i>and so not intermarriable. If there had been <i>descent in male line, </i>they would also have belonged to <i>the same gens, </i>and this would have been another obstacle <i>to marriage. The fifty daughters of Danaus — </i>the Danaides <i>fled from Egypt to Argos </i>to escape unlawful and incestuous wedlock. This event was foretold to Io by Prometheus<i> Aeschylus</i>, 853).</p>
<p>In <i>AEschylus’ </i>play<i> The Supplices </i>the Danaides declare to the <i>kindred Argives</i> (in Argos) that they had not been exiled from Egypt</p>
<p class="indentb">By <i>popular decree</i> on account of a <i>bloody deed</i> (murder) <br>
But [had fled] <i>out of fear of men</i>, <br>
Condemning <i>consanguineous and unholy marriage</i> <br>
<i>To the sons of AEgyptus</i>.</p>
<p>(The passage seems spoiled<i>, grammatically; </i>see Schütz, “<i>AEschylus</i>” (Vol. 2, p. 378)<i>.</i></p>
<p>Further: After they heard the case of the suppliants, the<i> Argives decided in council to grant them protection</i>, which implies the existence of a ban on such marriages and the validity of their objection. At the time this tragedy was performed, in Athens,<i> Athenian law itself facilitated and promoted marriage between children of brothers </i>in the case<i> </i>of <i>heiresses and orphans, </i>although this rule seems to have been confined to such exceptional cases.</p>

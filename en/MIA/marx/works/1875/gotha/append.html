</h3> <hr class="base" size="1"/> <p> </p> <p class="inline">"2. Normal working day."</p> <p>
In no other country has the workers' party limited itself to such an indefinite
demand, but has always fixed the length of the working day that it considers
normal under the given circumstances.
</p> <br> <p class="inline">"3. Restriction of female labor and prohibition of child labor."</p> <p>
The standardization of the working day must include the restriction of
female labor, insofar as it relates to the duration, intermissions, etc.,
of the working day; otherwise, it could only mean the exclusion of female
labor from branches of industry that are especially unhealthy for the female
body, or are objectionable morally for the female sex. If that is what
was meant, it should have been said so.

<p>"Prohibition of child labor." Here it was absolutely essential
to state the age limit.

<p>A general prohibition of child labor is incompatible with the
existence of large-scale industry and hence an empty, pious wish. Its realization
-- if it were possible -- would be reactionary, since, with a strict regulation
of the working time according to the different age groups and other safety
measures for the protection of children, an early combination of productive
labor with education is one of the most potent means for the transformation
of present-day society.
</p> <br> <p class="inline">"4. State supervision of factory, workshop, and domestic industry."</p> <p>
In consideration of the Prusso-German state, it should definitely have
been demanded that the inspectors are to be removable only by a court of
law; that any worker can have them prosecuted for neglect of duty; that
they must belong to the medical profession.
</p> <br> <p class="inline">"5. Regulation of prison labor."</p> <p>
A petty demand in a general workers' program. In any case, it should have
been clearly stated that there is no intention from fear of competition
to allow ordinary criminals to be treated like beasts, and especially that
there is no desire to deprive them of their sole means of betterment, productive
labor. This was surely the least one might have expected from socialists.
</p> <br> <p class="inline">"6. An effective liability law."</p> <p>
It should have been stated what is meant by an "effective" liability law.

<p>Be it noted, incidentally, that, in speaking of the normal working
day, the part of factory legislation that deals with health regulations
and safety measures, etc., has been overlooked. The liability law comes
into operation only when these regulations are infringed.

<p>In short, this appendix also is distinguished by slovenly editing.

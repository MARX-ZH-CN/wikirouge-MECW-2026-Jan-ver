<p class="fst">The undersigned promised to contribute to the <i>Social-Demokrat</i>
and permitted their being named as contributors on the express condition
that the paper would be edited in the spirit of the brief programme submitted
to them. They did not for a moment fail to appreciate the difficult position
of the <i>Social-Demokrat</i> and therefore made no demands that were inappropriate
to the meridian of Berlin. But they repeatedly demanded that the language
directed at the ministry and the feudalabsolutist party should be at least
as bold as that aimed at the men of Progress. The tactics pursued by the
<i>Social-Demokrat</i> preclude their further participation in it. The
opinion of the undersigned as to the royal Prussian governmental socialism
and the correct attitude of the workers' party to such deception has already
been set out in detail in No. 73 of the <i>Deutsche-Brusseler-Zeitung</i>
of September 12, 1847, in reply to No. 206 of the <i>Rheinischer Beobachter
(then</i> appearing in Cologne) [reference to Marx's article "The Communism
of the <i>Rheinischer Beobachter"</i>], in which the alliance of the "proletariat"
with the "government" against the "liberal bourgeoisie" was proposed. We
still subscribe today to every word of the statement we made then.</p>

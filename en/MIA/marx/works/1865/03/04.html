<p>Leaving Lefort in the vicinity for the time being, Schily then goes to Fribourg’s, Where they found different friends, amongst others a friend of Leforts. All were decidedly against his intrusion. Schily — then went away to fetch him, and did not conceal from him that he considered his claim such as formulated by him untenable (p. 2).

<h3>Notes from MECW</h3>
<p class="information"><span class="term"><a id="n233"></a>233</span> Marx made a slip of the pen here: — February 24” instead of “February 23”. Hence the events of February 24, in particular the Council’s evening meeting, were erroneously attributed to February 25. An exclamation mark suggests that Marx himself was puzzled by this date. </p>
<p class="information"><span class="term"><a id="n234"></a>234</span> It is evident from Schily’s letter to Marx that in the morning of February 24 Lefort expressed his apprehension that the Paris Administration might be “deceived by Bonapartists”. A guarantee against this, he believed, was his appointment as “literary defender” of the International Working Men’s Association in Paris. </p>

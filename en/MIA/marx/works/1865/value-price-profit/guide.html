1. Marx refers to Weston's argument that the total portion of the national product accruing to wages must remain constant. The modern expression of this theory is “that wage rises cause inflation”, and that therefore any increase in wages will cause inflation and reduce real wages back to where they started. How would you respond to this version of Weston's argument in terms of inflation?<br>

1. By what line of argument does Marx prove that a rise in wages will bring about an increase in the mass of commodities which the workers will be able to purchase with their now increased wages?<br>
2. Why does not Marx accept the idea that the price at which a commodity is sold is determined by the total cost of production, from which it follows that if the wage costs rise then the total price must rise?<br>
3. What do you think explains the <i>fall</i> in prices that Marx alleges resulted from the overall increase in agricultural wages and shortening of the working day?<br>

1. Why does Marx say that “the value of labour” is <i>senseless</i>?<br>
2. According to bourgeois economics, the worker sells her "services" to the capitalist, just the same as the capitalist in the service sector; both sell their services and earn a revenue from the sale at the going rate of profit. What's wrong with this argument?<br>
3. How is the value of a <i>service</i> determined? Surely eight hours labour in the form of a service (e.g. if you hire an electrician to re-wire your house) is worth eight hours. But how could be worth any more than eight hours wages for the given trade (e.g. what an electrician working for a big building firm would get paid)?<br>

Supposing the productivity of labour was doubled, i.e., workers produced twice as much product in the same time, simply by improved techniques, and the value of money remaining constant, the prices of all commodities halved:<br><br>
1. In an unregulated labour market, with no trade unions, what would you expect to happen to wages? What sort of social phenomena would you expect such a change to cause?<br>
2. Assuming wages adjusted themselves in this way, what would be the effect on the rate of surplus value?<br>

<h4>[London,] 13 May 1865</h4>
<p><strong>Dear Fred</strong>,</p>
<p>The £5 received with <strong>thanks</strong>. Will be invested as suggested.</p>
<p>You are right about the <strong>Committee in Manchester</strong>.</p>
<p><i>Quoad</i> E. Jones, it is necessary to march with him for the time being. He and his people will be figuring at the next Manchester <strong>Conference</strong> (<strong>next Tuesday</strong>) together with our <strong>delegates</strong> (Odger and Cremer <strong>on the part of the International Association</strong>), Howell as secretary of the <strong>Reform League</strong> (<strong>Bricklayer, one of the members of our Council</strong>) and Beales and Mason Jones as bourgeois representatives of the same <strong>League</strong>. </p>
<p>Without us this <strong>Reform League</strong> would never have come into existence, or else it would have fallen into the hands of the <strong>middleclass</strong>. The glorious failure of <strong>Baines’s Bill</strong> (which will result in a <strong>change of Ministry</strong> and the <strong>coming in</strong> of the Tories), originally <strong>supported by the Government, which wanted some such small measure for the hustings</strong>, occurred in the Lower House itself with direct reference to the ‘extravagant’ demands recently put up by the <strong>working class</strong> (<strong>i.e. our men</strong>).</p>
<p>As Dronke wrote me, Reinach I, who is now <strong>Managing Director</strong> of the <strong>Bank of Switzerland</strong>, will be ruthlessly putting an end to the <strong>office</strong> in London, which is causing nothing but expenses. Reinach I is, of course, not bound by the same political and personal considerations as Fazy and Klapka were.</p>
<p>A ghastly carbuncle has broken out again on my left hip, <strong>near</strong> the <strong>inexpressible part of the body</strong>.</p>
<p>Regards to <strong>Mrs Lizzy</strong>.</p>
<p><i>Salut. </i></p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. M.</p>
<p>Apropos. Monsieur Le Lubez, who had miscalculated about how important and dangerous he is, <strong>wants now to return to the Central Council in the capacity of a representative ‘for Greenwich'</strong>! We replied that <i>d'abord </i>we had to wait for certain letters to come, which he had written to France at the time of the <strong>conflict</strong>.</p>
<p>I hardly think the <i>Social-Demokrat</i> will see out another quarter. Moses believed himself safely ensconced and didn’t want to give up his prestigious position as Lassalle’s really secret agent at any price. <i>Le pauvre diable!</i></p>
<p>Lassalle’s will is now proven. He has left <b>nothing</b> to B. Becker apart from his ‘<strong>nomination’,</strong> accompanied by rules of conduct dictated ‘with all severity and authority’.</p>

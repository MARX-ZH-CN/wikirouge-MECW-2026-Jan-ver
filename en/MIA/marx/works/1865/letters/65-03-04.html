<h4>[London,] 4 March 1865</h4>
<p><strong>Dear Fred</strong>,</p>
<p>Our statement is in today’s <i>Social-Demokrat. </i>Although claiming that the statement from these ‘gentlemen’ requires no further comment, Mr Schweitzer has, nevertheless, ‘<i>anonymously</i>’ devoted one of his ‘bloody pretentious’ <strong>leaders</strong> to us. Lassalle and B. Becker, ‘President of Mankind’, <strong>for ever</strong>! At all events, I have Mr Schweitzer’s exceedingly humble letter of invitation, etc. in my possession. Siebel has sent 5 newspapers (the <i>Barmer, </i>the <i>Elberfelder, </i>the <i>Düsseldorfer, </i>the <i>Rheinische </i>and the <i>Neue Frankfurter</i>) carrying the statement. The enclosed cutting is from the <i>Elberfelder. </i>I am glad, firstly, that we are ‘out’ and, secondly, that we were ‘in’. If we had not been, we would never have penetrated the ‘<i>mystères </i>of Lassalle’.</p>
<p>I have written to Kugelmann (please send his prescription back to me) about your pamphlet (it looks <i>very good </i>in print; if there is a 2nd impression, only a sentence here and there would need to be altered). Can you send me another 2 <strong>copies</strong>? I would like to use Eccarius’ good offices to put two short notices in Bender’s rag (London) and in the <i>Hermann, </i>but that will hardly be possible unless I let them have 2 Copies. </p>
<p>The ‘<i>Polish Meeting’ </i>(<strong>Wednesday</strong>) went off very well, and full, although the <strong>bourgeois</strong> had done everything they could to wreck it by declaring it ‘<strong>inopportune’.</strong></p>
<p>Affairs <i>In France are very complicated</i>. I will tell you about it and send you Schily’s <strong>report</strong> (I have to translate extracts from it this very day and accordingly inform the <strong>subcommittee</strong> of it) in my next letter. For the moment, I shall just mention that there is <strong>a fight</strong> between our original workers’ representatives and the politico-social gentlemen (including the boss of the <i>Association so </i>admired by Moses) as to <i>who is </i>to be in contact with us. The [French], particularly the <i>Parisian </i>workers (although already links with 25 other French cities, too) literally regard the London <strong>Council</strong> as a workers’ government ‘abroad’.</p>
<p>Major Wolff has returned after serving his sentence in Alessandria.</p>
<p>Apropos: did I tell you that <i>Mazzini </i>later secretly communicated his ‘displeasure’ to Fontana after all (and his predilection for K. Blind, whom he had himself branded as a ‘liar’)?</p>
<p>Your wine came yesterday; received with <strong>thanks</strong>.</p>
<p>For the past week my brother-in-law from the Cape has been here again; he leaves next Tuesday. My niece, from Maastricht came with him (daughter of my sister, widow Schmalhausen); I shall have to take her back in <strong>about a week later</strong>.</p>
<p>My old trouble is plaguing me in various sensitive and ‘aggravating’ places, so that sitting down is difficult.</p>
<p>Apropos: is the Lupus affair still not quite wound up? Ditto I never heard a word from Mr Borchardt about the outstanding money he was going to collect in. You will see from the enclosed scrawl, which is just one example, how I am being sent claims of every conceivable kind, things I had totally forgotten about. This is the most recent to have raised its head from the days of the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung. </i>It is something I have to take into account in every possible way because otherwise the fellows will make a public scandal.</p>
<p>It seems all up with <strong>Confederacy</strong>.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. M.</p>
<p>I wonder if you could send me the papers from the Manchester press relating to the <strong>cotton-crisis</strong>?</p>

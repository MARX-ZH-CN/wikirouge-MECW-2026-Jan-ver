<h4>[London,] 1 May 1865</h4>
<p><strong>Dear Fred</strong>,</p>
<p>You must excuse me for not writing until today and thus breaking <strong>my last promise</strong>. It happened not because it is ‘sheer delight to break one’s word’, but because I really am <strong>overworked</strong>, as completing my book <span class="context">[Capital]</span>, on the one hand, and the <strong>International Association</strong> on the other, are making very heavy demands on my time.</p>
<p>Today is little Jenny’s birthday, and this evening I shall be having Ernest Jones to my house along with Odger, Cremer, Fox and Jung, so it will be a political birthday party. Laura <strong>had ‘the question popped’ </strong>by one Charles Manning, born in South America, English father, Spanish mother. He’s rich and generally a nice fellow, <strong>but Laura ‘does not care a pin for him’. ‘She has already known how to damp’ </strong>the passionate southern temperament. However, as my girl is a friend of his sisters, and he is frightfully <strong>in love</strong>, it is <strong>a disagreeable case</strong>.</p>
<p>I enclose <i>a ‘curiosity’. </i>The <i>Nordstern’s </i>correction makes it a worthy organ of the German louts.</p>
<p>I am also enclosing for <strong>you the latter end</strong> of a letter from Schily, whose report on the Moses woman will amuse you.</p>
<p>The great achievement of the ‘<strong>International Association’ </strong>is this:</p>
<p>The <strong>Reform League</strong> is <strong>our work</strong>. On the inner committee of 12 (6 <strong>middleclassmen</strong> and 6 <strong>workingmen</strong>), the <strong>workingmen</strong> are <strong>all members of our Council</strong> (including Eccarius). <strong>We have baffled</strong> all attempts by the middle class <strong>to mislead the working class</strong>. This time the movement in the provinces is completely dependent on that in London. Ernest Jones, e.g., had <strong>despaired till we set the ball a-going</strong>. If we succeed in re-electrifying the <strong>political movement</strong> of the <strong>English working class</strong>, our <strong>Association</strong> will already have done more for the European working class, <strong>without making any fuss</strong>, than was possible <strong>in any other way</strong>. And there is every prospect of success.</p>
<p>You know that the <i>Italian </i>society has not withdrawn from the <strong>Association</strong>, but its <strong>delegates</strong> have from the <strong>Council</strong>. We now have <i>Spaniards </i>on it instead. <strong>One Roman nation for the other</strong>. If those fellows don’t appoint new delegates soon, as we have asked them to, Bakunin will have to arrange <strong>for some life Italians</strong>.</p>
<p><i>Weber junior </i>has been thrown out of the workers’ society here for making false reports to the <i>Social-Demokrat </i>and for stirring up trouble in the branch society ‘Teutonia’, which is run by two fanatical Prussians by the name of Klinker.</p>
<p>Our joint statement really was successful beyond all expectation. Not merely have we blown apart the ‘General Association of German Workers’ as an organ of the Prussian government and in <strong>six words</strong> generally cleared the heads of the German workers of their intoxication with royalty. The present <i>split in the Party of Progress </i>was also the direct result of our stand.</p>
<p>The <strong>chivalry of the South</strong><i> </i>has ended worthily. In addition, Lincoln’s <strong>assassination</strong> was the most stupid act they could have committed. <i>Johnson is </i><strong>stern, inflexible, revengeful</strong> and as a former <strong>poor White</strong> has a deadly hatred of the oligarchy. He will make less fuss about these fellows, and, because of the treachery, he will find the <strong>temper</strong> of the North commensurate with his <strong>intentions</strong>.</p>
<p>Did you see how Blind <strong>heads</strong> the letter of condolence from the ‘influential’ Germans? Blind is a genius in his way. <strong>In the very nick of time</strong> he does not merely go running to Freiligrath, etc., but has enough presence of mind to realise that, of the other signatories, <strong>alphabetically</strong> ‘Berndes’ would open the list. So, he runs first to Freiligrath, etc., and gets him first of all to form a group and, after that worthy (who is now at one with Ruge as well), certain other <strong>influentials</strong>, I almost said <strong>infinitesimals</strong>, such as Heintzmann and Kinkel, and puts himself ‘alphabetically’ at the top. Then he goes running to Berndes and gets him to start a second column next to himself, so that another lot of names, Trübner, etc., follows on. That is how the matter appears in <i>The Times. </i>In the same day’s <i>Morning Star </i>the second column is added to the bottom of the first, with Blind <strong>at the top of the whole, and his footman</strong> Freiligrath after him, etc. And not content with that, at his instigation, the <i>Star </i>of the same number also carries a notice on the front page <strong>that ‘Karl Blind heads, etc.’.</strong></p>
<p>Isn’t that genius for you?</p>
<p><i>Salut. </i></p>

<h4>[London,] 9 May 1865 </h4>
<p><strong>Dear Fred</strong>,</p>
<p>You need not send anything back (except Schily’s letter). just keep the things safely. I enclose <strong>one</strong> <i>Free Press </i>(the <strong>queer article</strong> on the ‘<strong>Reconstruction of Italy</strong>’ is from the pen of the <strong>High Priest</strong> himself, from Urquhart), also two <i>Nordsterns </i>(one of them somewhat out of date). I've got a subscription to the latter, but no longer to the <i>Social-Demokrat. </i>The latest <i>Nordstern </i>will give you some idea of the situation on the Rhine. Incidentally, the <i>total number </i>of the faithful whom B. Becker still commands is barely 1,000.</p>
<p>Before I forget: there were several allusions to your pamphlet in the debate in the Prussian Chamber. <i>Gneist, </i>for instance, said the Minister of War would not persuade them, even if his statistics spoke with the tongue of ‘<i>Engels’ </i>(Laughter.) (That is how the affair appeared in the <i>Berliner Reform</i>.)</p>
<p>As everywhere, the London workers, of course, also include <strong>a knot of asses, fools and rogues, rallying</strong> round a scoundrel. The scoundrel in this case is ‘George Potter’, <strong>a rat of a man, supported</strong> by a <strong>venal</strong> but witty Irishman by the name of <i>Connolly, </i>who is a dangerous <strong>stump-orator</strong>. Although the bourgeoisie hate the said Potter as chief <strong>strike-manager</strong>, they do, nevertheless, support him against our people because they smell <strong>venality</strong> in him, whereas they know that our people are <strong>true men</strong>. This Potter <strong>derives his power</strong> particularly from the fact that he is <strong>presently </strong>the <strong>Manager</strong> of <i>The Bee-Hive, </i>the official organ of the <strong>trades unions</strong>, although he uses it against the <strong>Official Council</strong><i> </i>of these <strong>unions</strong> which is in our hands. Since the paper is based on shares, the idea is now to distribute as many <strong>shares</strong> as possible (<strong>5sh. per share</strong>) amongst our workers. For my part I have undertaken to collect the <strong>money</strong> for <strong>about</strong> 30 <strong>shares</strong>. For this, I'm counting on <strong>you</strong> (<strong>single handed</strong> or with friends) for £5, <strong>I write to</strong><i> </i>Dronke for £1 and I will pay the rest myself. (Although <strong>my function</strong> with the <strong>Central Council</strong> costs me a <i>lot </i>of money, compared with what I can afford.) The money must already be <strong>at hand</strong> <i>this </i>week, as the General Meeting of the <strong>shareholders</strong> is next week. If we are only strong enough (and Odger, for instance, has guaranteed 50 <strong>shares</strong>) to elect the <strong>Directors</strong><i>, </i>we shall have that rogue Potter (who is only the <strong>Manager</strong>) <strong>under our thumbs</strong>. This matter is of decisive importance for the whole movement.</p>
<p>E. Jones was here, very charming <strong>socially speaking</strong>. But between ourselves, <i>he is only </i>trying to use our Association for electoral agitation. Of the 12 cards I sent him, he returned 11, he had not sold a single one, whereas <strong>poor</strong> Schily, for instance, paid for <i>24 </i>for himself alone. I told him he should just put them back in his pocket again, I would dispose of them later, but I could not appear in front of the English workers and tell them that. <strong>By and by he will find out</strong> that if only for speculative reasons he should not have treated the business so lightly and <strong>rather contemptibly</strong>. <i>I will </i>write to him and tell him to hand over the ‘<strong>Addresses’ </strong>to <strong>you</strong>. You can give them to whomsoever you please. They are just dead weight with him. Incidentally, I don’t take kindly to the fact that he was here to wangle a job as <strong>Recorder</strong><i> </i>out of Sir <i>G. </i>Grey either.</p>
<p>Today I am to submit an ‘<strong>Address to President Johnson </strong>Mr <i>Le Lubez </i>wants to return to the <strong>Council</strong> as — <strong>Delegate for Deptford</strong>, the same fellow as resigned as <strong>Delegate for France, but his admittance</strong> (<strong>We have to confirm the delegates</strong>) <strong>will not run quite so smoothly as he seems to fancy</strong>. I would be pleased if you could form even just <strong>a branch of 6 men</strong> in Manchester, and could get yourself elected as their <strong>correspondent for London</strong>. For <strong>the corresponding</strong> people are <i>eo ipso </i><strong>members of the Central Council</strong>, and have a seat and a vote on it, <strong>when at London</strong>.</p>
<p>New <strong>branches</strong> have been formed in Lyon, Neufchâteau (<i>département des Vosges</i>) and St Denis. The French <strong>branches</strong> (apart from Paris) are not linked with Paris, in view of the existing laws, but directly with London.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to put the finishing touches to my book <span class="context">[<i>Capital</i>]</span> by 1 September (despite numerous interruptions). It’s going ahead well, although I am still not quite well. </p>

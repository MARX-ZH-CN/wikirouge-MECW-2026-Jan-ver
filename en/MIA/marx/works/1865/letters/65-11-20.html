<h4>[London,] 20 November 1865</h4>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>Little Jenny is on the mend again now and thanks you very much for the wine.</p>
<p>Regarding the financial questions, it would be futile to approach Dronke about it. To have some peace with the <strong>landlord</strong>, and that is at the root of it all, I have persuaded him to take a bill of exchange up till the middle of February for the current quarter, for which I owe him 2/3. As for the other creditors, I have satisfied the most pressing with the £15 and am considering ways and means of putting together at least an instalment for the others. Your offer is very generous, and as soon as my work <span class="context">[Capital]</span> is finished and out, the remainder will have to be made up through other commitments, or if that should not succeed, <i>although I fully expect it will</i>, we shall have to move somewhere cheaper, perhaps to Switzerland.</p>
<p>The Berlin letter is genuine <span class="context">[re an impending split in the German Workers’ Association]</span>. Some days after it arrived, I received a letter about it from Liebknecht, who is in continuous contact with the Berliners. It also emerges from Liebknecht’s letter that those curs from the <i>Social-Demokrat </i>would oh so dearly love to resume their ties with us. The kind of illusions Liebknecht is for ever indulging in can be seen from the following passage:</p>
<p class="quoteb">*‘the people that have applied to you from Berlin, are our friends. If you could come, show yourself but once — the gain would be immense. Come if it is possible.'*</p>
<p>Surely Liebknecht ought to know that even if I could go to Berlin <strong>at present</strong>, just as a <strong>visitor</strong>, I would have to be completely quiet and keep myself to myself and not address workers’ clubs!</p>
<p>Liebknecht also writes:</p>
<p class="quoteb">*‘Professor <i>Eckardt’* </i>(now the ‘Principal’ radical in the south, as a letter from Stumpf in Mainz makes clear) *‘of Mannheim places the <i>Wochenblatt </i>at our disposal. He would be delighted if you and Engels were to write for it a few articles, but not too strong.’*</p>
<p><i>The Workman’s Advocate</i> is as weak as ever. However, it must have some appeal as it appeared in a larger format last week. I know no more details, as I shall be present at the Association again for the first time tomorrow. The Parisians have published a report on the <i>conference </i>together with the <i>programme </i>we drew up for the next congress. It appeared in <i>all </i>the liberal, quasi-liberal and republican papers in Paris. You will see what a friendly reception it had from the following report by Fox on the last meeting of our <strong>Council</strong> which I am cutting out of <i>The Workman’s Advocate </i>for you. Our Parisians are somewhat taken aback that the para. on Russia and Poland which they did <i>not </i>wish to have, is the very one to create the biggest stir. I hope that you will now use some of your leisure time to write the occasional article on one subject or another for the <i>Advocate.</i></p>
<p>The Paris publication absolves me from the trouble of writing a report on France.</p>
<p>The Jamaican business is typical of the utter turpitude of the ‘<strong>true Englishman</strong>’. These fellows are as bad as the Russians in every respect. But, says the good old <i>Times, </i>these <strong>damned rogues enjoyed ‘all the liberties of an Anglo-Saxon Constitution’.</strong> I.e. they <strong>enjoyed the liberty</strong>, amongst others, of having their hides taxed to raise money for the <strong>planters</strong> to import <strong>coolies</strong> and thus depress their own labour market below the minimum. And these English curs with their sensibilities sent up an outcry about ‘<strong>beast</strong> Butler’ for hanging <i>one </i>man! and refusing to allow the former planters’ diamond-spangled yellow womenfolk to spit in the faces of the <strong>Federal soldiers</strong>! The Irish affair and the Jamaica <strong>butcheries</strong> were all that was needed after the American war to complete the unmasking of English hypocrisy!</p>
<p>Please do not forget to obtain the necessary data from Knowles for me (and <i>as soon as possible</i>). <strong>Average weekly wages</strong>, either for a <strong>mule spinner</strong>, or for a female <strong>throstle</strong> spinner; <i>how much </i>yarn (or <i>cotton, </i>that is, <i>including </i>the <i>déchet </i>that is lost in spinning) is spun <i>per week</i> <strong>on average</strong> by an <strong>average number</strong> (Or, for that matter, any number) by each individual; and then, of course, an arbitrary (corresponding to the labour-wage) <i>price </i>for the cotton and the <i>price of yarn. </i>I cannot write out the second chapter until I have these details.</p>
<p>Ernest Jones’ address is now 47 Princess Street.</p>

<p class="verse">Never can I do in peace <br>
That with which my Soul’s obsessed, <br>
Never take things at my ease; <br>
I must press on without rest. </p>
<p class="verse">Others only know elation <br>
When things go their peaceful way, <br>
Free with self-congratulation, <br>
Giving thanks each time they pray. </p>
<p class="verse">I am caught in endless strife, <br>
Endless ferment, endless dream; <br>
I cannot conform to Life, <br>
Will not travel with the stream. </p>
<p class="verse">Heaven I would comprehend, <br>
I would draw the world to me; <br>
Loving, hating, I intend  <br>
That my star shine brilliantly. </p>
<p class="verse">All things I would strive to win, <br>
All the blessings Gods impart, <br>
Grasp all knowledge deep within, <br>
Plumb the depths of Song and Art. </p>
<p class="verse">Worlds I would destroy for ever, <br>
Since I can create no world, <br>
Since my call they notice never, <br>
Coursing dumb in magic whirl. </p>
<p class="verse">Dead and dumb, they stare away <br>
At our deeds with scorn up yonder; <br>
We and all our works decay -- <br>
Heedless on their ways they wander. </p>
<p class="verse">Yet their lot I would share never --  <br>
Swept on by the flooding tide, <br>
On through nothing rushing ever, <br>
Fretful in their Pomp and Pride. </p>
<p class="verse">Swiftly fall and are destroyed <br>
Halls and bastions in their turn; <br>
As they fly into the Void,  <br>
Yet another Empire’s born. </p>
<p class="verse">So it rolls from year to year, <br>
From the Nothing to the All, <br>
From the Cradle to the Bier, <br>
Endless Rise and endless Fall. </p>
<p class="verse">So the spirits go their way <br>
Till they are consumed outright, <br>
Till their Lords and Masters they <br>
Totally annihilate. </p>
<p class="verse">Then let us traverse with daring <br>
That predestined God-drawn ring, <br>
Joy and Sorrow fully sharing <br>
As the scales of Fortune swing. </p>
<p class="verse">Therefore let us risk our all,  <br>
Never resting, never tiring; <br>
Not in silence dismal, dull, <br>
Without action or desiring;  </p>
<p class="verse">Not in brooding introspection <br>
Bowed beneath a yoke of pain, <br>
So that yearning, dream and action <br>
Unfulfilled to us remain. <br>

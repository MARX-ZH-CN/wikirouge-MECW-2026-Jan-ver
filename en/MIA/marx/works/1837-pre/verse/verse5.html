<h1>Siren Song</h1>
<h3>A Ballad</h3>
<p class="fst">
The wave, soft murmuring,<br>
With the wind frolicking,<br>
Leaps up into the air.<br>
You see it tremble, hover,<br>
Tumble and topple over,<br>
It is the Sirens' lair.</p>
<p class="fst">
They pluck the lyre to enthrall<br>
In heavenly festival,<br>
In melody divine.<br>
They draw both near and far,<br>
Earth and distant star<br>
     Into their song sublime.
<p class="fst">
Its charm is so profound<br>
One cannot chide the sound<br>
That soars so radiantly.<br>
As if great spirits there<br>
Would lure the listener<br>
Into the dark blue sea.</p>
<p class="fst">
As if there swells and grows<br>
From waves a world that flows<br>
Loftily, secretly.<br>
As if in waters deep<br>
The Gods are all asleep<br>
     Down in the dark blue sea.</p>
<p class="fst">
A little boat draws near,<br>
The waves are charmed to hear<br>
A gentle bard exalted,<br>
His looks so frank and free,<br>
Image and melody<br>
     Like love and hope transfigured.</p>
<p class="fst">
His lyre rules o'er the deep.<br>
Naiads that were asleep<br>
    Lend him their song-charmed ear.<br>
And all the waves resound<br>
With song and lyre's sweet sound<br>
And dance high in the air.</p>
<p class="fst">
But hear the sad refrains,<br>
The Sirens' far-off strains<br>
Of sweet melodiousness.<br>
The poet to enthrall,<br>
The Goddesses shine all<br>
In sound and loveliness.</p>
<p class="fst">
"O youth, soar up and play,<br>
Rule o'er the listening sea;<br>
The goal you seek is high,<br>
     Your breast swells rapturously.</p>
<p class="fst">
"Here, sumptuous water-halls<br>
Your song alone surprises,<br>
And as the great tide falls,<br>
Ev'n so your music rises.</p>
<p class="fst">
"Sportive waves bear it up<br>
And send it surging high.<br>
The eye, bright, full of hope,<br>
 Encompasses the sky.</p>
<p class="fst">
"Enter our Spirit-Ring;<br>
     Magic your heart shall gain,<br>
Hear the waves dance and sing,<br>
They sound like True Love's pain.</p>
<p class="fst">
"Worlds came from the Ocean,<br>
Spirits were borne on the tide<br>
Which dared to cradle the High Ones,<br>
While the All was void.</p>
<p class="fst">
"As Heaven and star-glow<br>
    Look downwards, ever glancing<br>
Into the waves below,<br>
     Into the blue waves' dancing--</p>
<p class="fst">
"As droplets, shivering, shaking,<br>
Enfold the Worlds in pride,<br>
The spirits' life, awaking,<br>
Emerges from the tide.</p>
<p class="fst">
"Seeking the All inspires you?<br>
     You'd burn in song away?<br>
The lyre's sweet music stirs you?<br>
      You'd blaze in Heaven's ray?--</p>
<p class="fst">
"Then come down to us all,<br>
And tender us your hand;<br>
Your limbs shall Spirit be,<br>
      You'll see the deep, deep Land."</p>
<p class="fst">
They rise up from the sea,<br>
Hair weaving in roundelay,<br>
Heads resting on the air.<br>
Their eyes flash blazing fires,<br>
And, shooting sparks, their lyres<br>
Glow through the waters fair.
<p class="fst">
The Youth yields to Delusion,<br>
His tears flow in profusion,<br>
      His heart pounds in his breast.<br>
He cannot turn away,<br>
Held captive in Love's sway,<br>
To burning passion lost.</p>
<p class="fst">
Deep thoughts stir in his soul,<br>
It fights to gain control,<br>
      Soars higher, ever higher,<br>
Looks up with prideful bearing,<br>
In God's own image daring,<br>
And this the Sirens hear:</p>
<p class="fst">
"In your cold depths below<br>
Nothing that's High can go,<br>
Nor God burn deathlessly.<br>
You glitter but to ensnare,<br>
For me you have no care,<br>
Your songs are mockery.</p>
<p class="fst">
"You lack the bosom's beat,<br>
 The heart's life-giving heat,<br>
      The soul's high flight so free.<br>
The Gods in my breast rule,<br>
And I obey them all;<br>
      I mean no treachery.</p>
<p class="fst">
"You shall not captivate<br>
Me, nor my love, nor hate,<br>
Nor yet my yearning's glow.<br>
It shoots like lightning shafts<br>
That gentle power uplifts<br>
In melodies that flow.</p>
<p class="fst">
The Sirens all sink down<br>
Before his blazing frown<br>
     In weeping springs of light.<br>
They seek to follow him,<br>
But ah, the Flood so grim<br>
     Engulfs them all from sight.</p>

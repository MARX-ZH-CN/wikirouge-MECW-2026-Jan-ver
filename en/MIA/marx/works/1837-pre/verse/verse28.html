<h1>The Abduction</h1>
<h3>A Ballad</h3>
<p class="fst">
The Knight, he stands at the iron gate,<br>
The Maiden so sweet and fair looks out.<br>
"Dear Knight, however can I come down?"<br>
And silence and darkness reign all round.</p>
<p class="fst">
"Catch this I throw, and it shall be<br>
Your rescue's sweetest surety.<br>
Up there you can firmly bind the end,<br>
And by the rope you may descend."</p>
<p class="fst">
"Ah, Knight, I fly like a thief to you,<br>
Ah, Knight, for love what won't I do!"<br>
"Dear love, you take but what's your own,<br>
We'll flee like shadows that dance and are gone!"</p>
<p class="fst">
"Ah, Knight, the darkness yawns below,<br>
My senses reel, I dare not go!"<br>
"Then you refuse; my life I'd stake,<br>
And yet at empty terrors you quake!"</p>
<p class="fst">
"Ah, Knight, ah, Knight, you play with fire,<br>
Yet you alone are my heart's desire!<br>
Farewell, ye Halls, forever and ay,<br>
Where never again my feet shall stray.</p>
<p class="fst">
"What lures me on I cannot fight;<br>
Ye loved ones all, I bid good-night!"<br>
No more she demurs and plays for time,<br>
She clutches the rope for the downward climb.</p>
<p class="fst">
No sooner has she slid halfway,<br>
Than she takes fright, her glances stray.<br>
Her arms grow weak, she must let go<br>
To fall on the breast of Death below.</p>
<p class="fst">
"Ah, Knight, warm me once more, and I<br>
Blissfully in your arms may die,<br>
Let me but breathe your every kiss,<br>
And I'll fade into sweet nothingness."</p>
<p class="fst">
The Knight embraces her trembling form,<br>
And to his bosom he presses her, warm.<br>
And as their souls together strain,<br>
He too is pierced by mortal pain.</p>
<p class="fst">
"Farewell, my Love, so true, so kind!"<br>
"Stay, and I'll follow close behind!"<br>
A flash, as of eternal fire,-<br>
Their souls depart and they expire.</p>

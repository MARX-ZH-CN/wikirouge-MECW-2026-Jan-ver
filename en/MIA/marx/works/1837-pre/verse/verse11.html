<h1>Invocation of One in Despair</h1>
<p class="fst">
So a god has snatched from me my all<br>
In the curse and rack of Destiny.<br>
All his worlds are gone beyond recall!<br>
Nothing but revenge is left to me!</p>
<p class="fst">
On myself revenge I'll proudly wreak,<br>
On that being, that enthroned Lord,<br>
Make my strength a patchwork of what's weak,<br>
Leave my better self without reward!</p>
<p class="fst">
I shall build my throne high overhead,<br>
Cold, tremendous shall its summit be.<br>
For its bulwark-- superstitious dread,<br>
For its Marshall--blackest agony.</p>
<p class="fst">
Who looks on it with a healthy eye,<br>
     Shall turn back, struck deathly pale and dumb;<br>
Clutched by blind and chill Mortality<br>
May his happiness prepare its tomb.
<p class="fst">
And the Almighty's lightning shall rebound<br>
From that massive iron giant.<br>
If he bring my walls and towers down,<br>
Eternity shall raise them up, defiant.</p>

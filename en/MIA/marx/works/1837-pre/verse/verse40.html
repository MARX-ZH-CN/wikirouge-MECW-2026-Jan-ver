<h1>Dream Vision</h1>
<h5>A Dithyramb</h5>
<p>
From my dreamings I would coax <br>
Soft an image in scent-woven web; <br>
I would weave rings passing fair <br>
From the locks of my own hair; <br>
Night-encompassed, heart's blood I would swell <br>
That, from waves of dream, fire-image well, <br>
Image, ebbing and a-flowing,<br>
    Fair in love, Aeolian music sighing.</p>
<p>
It would soar, all golden shining, <br>
And the little house would arch up higher, <br>
And my locks would wander, curling, <br>
Divinest girl in darkness furling, <br>
Forth in pearly songs my blood would flow, <br>
Streaming round the marble shoulders' glow, <br>
And the lamp would flicker Suns, <br>
My heart would flood Heaven's dome.</p>
<p>
Down would shake the rooms all round, <br>
But for me, grown into Giant-Hero, <br>
In his mighty gaze high festal fire, <br>
World-great would be storm's lyre, <br>
Thunder-song my heart would beat amain <br>
Suns would be its love and rock its pain, <br>
Proudly-humble, I'd sink down,   <br>
     Proud-audacious, rush unto the breast.</p>

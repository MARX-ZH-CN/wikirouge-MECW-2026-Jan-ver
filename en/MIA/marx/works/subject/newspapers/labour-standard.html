<p class="information">As the 1870s drew to a close, the temporary peace
between the English classes grew shakey. The Great Depression of the 1870s
swept the western world and was, as always, particularly rough on the proletariat.
The capitalist cycle downturn set in motion familiar attacks by the capitalist
class against what reformist compromises within the capitalist system existed.</p>
<p class="information">George Shipton, Secretary of the London Trades Council, also served
as editor of <i>The Labour Standard</i>, the organ of British trade unions.
He asked Engels to contribute to a discussion of reformism and the labor
movement itself.</p>
<p class="information">Engels complied and, between May and August 1881, wrote 11 articles,
all appearing as unsigned editorials. He used contemporary issues to elaborate
basic economic principles of scientific socialism and the nature of capitalism
itself. Engels stressed the inevitability of the conflict between the capitalists
and the proletariat — that struggle isn't an aberration, it's a central
feature of capitalism. Capitalists will forever be interested in lowering
the wages and living conditions of the masses of property-less people because
it's simply in their interest.</p>
<p class="information">He held up trade unions as the daily defenders of the working
class in that struggle. In the first article, Engels said the labor movement
should lose the meaningless slogan "A Fair Day's Wages for a Fair Day's
Work" — since capitalism's internal nature prevents capitalists from being
"fair" to the workers whose wages they must continually seek to depress
— with the slogan: "Possesion of the means of work — raw material, factories,
machinery — by the working people themselves!"</p>
<p class="information">In the article "A Working Men's Party," Engels notes that unions
alone cannot break people free from the endless cycle of capitalist wage-slavery.
They must congregate in an independent political party. England's lack
of such a party kept the working class tailing after the "Great Liberal
Party." And that creates confusion and demoralization.</p>
<p class="information">The <i>MECW</i> notes: "These articles by Engels exerted a definite
influence on the young generation in the British socialist movement. James
Macdonald, later to be one of the representatives of the Marxist wing of
the British socialists, said what really attracted him to socialism were
Engels' articles in <i>The Labour Standard</i> (<i>How I Became A Socialist</i>,
London, 1896, pp. 61-62.)"</p>

Johann Philipp Becker, <a href="../../1882/letters/82-02-10.html" target=_blank>February 10 1882</a>)
we learn he stopped writing for the paper because of the growth of
"opportunist elements" in its editorial board.</p>

<p>If we have chosen the position in life in which we can most of all work for mankind, no burdens can bow us down, because they are sacrifices for the benefit of all; then we shall experience no petty, limited, selfish joy, but our happiness will belong to millions, our deeds will live on quietly but perpetually at work, and over our ashes will be shed the hot tears of noble people.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1837-pre/letters/37-11-10.html" target=_blank>Letter to His Father</a> (1837)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>History calls those men the greatest who have ennobled themselves by working for the common good; experience acclaims as happiest the man who has made the greatest number of people happy.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1837-pre/letters/37-11-10.html" target=_blank>Letter to His Father</a> (1837)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As Prometheus, having stolen fire from heaven, begins to build houses and to settle upon the earth, so philosophy, expanded to be the whole world, turns against the world of appearance. The same now with the philosophy of Hegel.<br><br>

<p> </p>
<p>Real talers have the same existence that the imagined gods have. Has a real taler any existence except in the imagination, if only in the general or rather common imagination of man? Bring paper money into a country where this use of paper is unknown, and everyone will laugh at your subjective imagination.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1841/dr-theses/appendix.html" target=_blank>Doctoral Thesis, Appendix</a> (1841)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Greek philosophy seems to have met with something with which a good tragedy is not supposed to meet, namely, a dull ending.<br><br>

<p>What is genuine is proved in the fire, what is false we shall not miss in our ranks. The opponents must grant us that youth has never before flocked to our colours in such numbers, ... in the end, one will be found among us who will prove that the sword of enthusiasm is just as good as the sword of genius.<br><br>
Engels, <a href="../../1841/anti-schelling/ch01.html#017" target=_blank>Anti-Schelling</a> (1841)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The representation of private interests ... abolishes all natural and spiritual distinctions by enthroning in their stead the immoral, irrational and soulless abstraction of a particular material object and a particular consciousness which is slavishly subordinated to this object.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1842/10/25.html" target=_blank>On the Thefts of Wood, in <i>Rheinische Zeitung</i></a> (1842)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“atheism” ... reminds one of children, assuring everyone who is ready to listen to them that they are not afraid of the bogy man.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1842/letters/42-11-30.html" target=_blank>Letter to 30 November 1842</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the year 1842-43, as editor of the <i>Rheinische Zeitung</i>, I first found myself in the embarrassing position of having to discuss what is known as material interests. ... the debates on free trade and protective tariffs caused me in the first instance to turn my attention to economic questions. ... When the publishers of the <i>Rheinische Zeitung</i> conceived the illusion that by a more compliant policy on the part of the paper it might be possible to secure the abrogation of the death sentence passed upon it, I eagerly grasped the opportunity to withdraw from the public stage to my study.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.html" target=_blank>Preface to the Critique of Political Economy</a> (1859)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Political economy came into being as a natural result of the expansion of trade, and with its appearance elementary, unscientific huckstering was replaced by a developed system of licensed fraud, an entire science of enrichment.<br><br>

<p> </p>
<p>The bureaucracy is a circle from which no one can escape. Its hierarchy is a hierarchy of knowledge.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1843/critique-hpr/ch03.html#027" target=_blank>Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right</a> (1843)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The bureaucrat has the world as a mere object of his action.<br><br>

<p> </p>
<p>This is a kind of mutual reconciliation society... Actual extremes cannot be mediated with each other precisely because they are actual extremes. But neither are they in need of mediation, because they are opposed in essence.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1843/critique-hpr/ch05.html#051" target=_blank>Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right</a> (1843)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All forms of the state have democracy for their truth, and for that reason are false to the extent that they are not democracy.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1843/critique-hpr/ch02.html" target=_blank>Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right</a> (1843)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We develop new principles for the world out of the world’s own principles. We do not say to the world: Cease your struggles, they are foolish; we will give you the true slogan of struggle. We merely show the world what it is really fighting for, and consciousness is something that it <i>has to </i>acquire, even if it does not want to.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1843/letters/43-09.html#p144" target=_blank>Letter from the <i>Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher</i> to Ruge</a> (1843)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Reason has always existed, but not always in a reasonable form.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1843/letters/43-09.html#p144" target=_blank>Letter from the <i>Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher</i> to Ruge</a> (1843)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But, if constructing the future and settling everything for all times are not our affair, it is all the more clear what we have to accomplish at present: I am referring to <i>ruthless criticism </i>of all that exists, ruthless both in the sense of not being afraid of the results it arrives at and in the sense of being just as little afraid of conflict with the powers that be.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1843/letters/43-09.html#criticism" target=_blank>Letter from the <i>Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher</i></a> (1843)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The weapon of criticism cannot, of course, replace criticism of the weapon, material force must be overthrown by material force; but<br>theory also becomes a material force as soon as it has gripped the masses.<br>Theory is capable of gripping the masses as soon as it demonstrates <i>ad hominem</i>, and it demonstrates ad hominem as soon as it becomes radical. To be radical is to grasp the root of the matter. But, for man, the root is man himself.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1843/critique-hpr/intro.html#32" target=_blank>Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right. Introduction</a> (1843)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions.<br>It is the opium of the people.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1843/critique-hpr/intro.html#05" target=_blank>Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right. Introduction</a> (1843)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The state is based on this contradiction. It is based on the contradiction between public and private life, between universal and particular interests. For this reason, the state must confine itself to formal, negative activities<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1844/08/07.html" target=_blank>Critical Notes on the Article ‘The King of Prussia and Social Reform. By a Prussian’</a> (1844)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When communist <i>artisans </i>associate with one another, theory, propaganda, etc., is their first end. But at the same time, as a result of this association, they acquire a new need — the need for society — and what appears as a means becomes an end. ... the brotherhood of man is no mere phrase with them, but a fact of life, and the nobility of man shines upon us from their work-hardened bodies.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1844/manuscripts/needs.html" target=_blank>Human Needs &amp; the division of Labour</a> (1844)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Do I obey economic laws if I extract money by offering my body for sale,... — Then the political economist replies to me: You do not transgress my laws; but see what Cousin Ethics and Cousin Religion have to say about it. My <i>political economic</i> ethics and religion have nothing to reproach you with, but — But whom am I now to believe, political economy or ethics? — The ethics of political economy is <i>acquisition</i>, work, thrift, sobriety — but political economy promises to satisfy my needs. ... It stems from the very nature of estrangement that each sphere applies to me a different and opposite yardstick — ethics one and political economy another; for each is a specific estrangement of man and focuses attention on a particular field of estranged essential activity, and each stands in an estranged relation to the other.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1844/manuscripts/needs.html" target=_blank>Human Needs &amp; the division of Labour</a> (1844)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The only intelligible language in which we converse with one another consists of our objects in their relation to each other. We would not understand a human language and it would remain without effect. By one side it would be recognised and felt as being a request, an entreaty, and therefore a <i>humiliation</i><br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1844/james-mill/index.html#078" target=_blank>Comment on James Mill</a> (1844)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our mutual value is for us the value of our mutual objects.<br>Hence for us man himself is mutually of no value.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1844/james-mill/index.html#078" target=_blank>Comment on James Mill</a> (1844)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Political Economy regards the proletarian ... like a horse, he must receive enough to enable him to work. It does not consider him, during the time when he is not working, as a human being. It leaves this to criminal law, doctors, religion, statistical tables, politics, and the beadle.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1844/manuscripts/wages.html" target=_blank>Wages of Labour</a> (1844)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Communism is the riddle of history solved, and it knows itself to be this solution.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1844/manuscripts/comm.html#44CC4" target=_blank>Private Property and Communism</a> (1844)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The entire movement of history, as simply communism’s <i>actual </i>act of genesis — the birth act of its empirical existence — is, therefore, for its thinking consciousness the <i>comprehended </i>and <i>known </i>process of its becoming.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1844/manuscripts/comm.html#44CC4" target=_blank>Private Property and Communism</a> (1844)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But also when I am active <i>scientifically, </i>etc. – an activity which I can seldom perform in direct community with others – then my activity is <i>social, </i>because I perform it as a man. Not only is the material of my activity given to me as a social product (as is even the language in which the thinker is active): my own existence is social activity, and therefore that which I make of myself, I make of myself for society and with the consciousness of myself as a social being.<br><br>
<a href="../../1844/manuscripts/comm.html#44CC5" target=_blank>Private Property and Communism</a> (1844)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Natural science will in time incorporate into itself the science of man, just as the science of man will incorporate into itself natural science: there will be <i>one</i> science.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1844/manuscripts/comm.html#44CC8" target=_blank>Private Property and Communism</a> (1844)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Natural science has invaded and transformed human life all the more <i>practically </i>through the medium of industry; and has prepared human emancipation, although its immediate effect had to be the furthering of the dehumanisation of man. <i>Industry </i>is the <i>actual</i>, historical relationship of nature, .... &lt;The nature which develops in human history — the genesis of human society — is man’s real nature; hence nature as it develops through industry, even though in an <i>estranged </i>form, is true <i>anthropological </i>nature.&gt;<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1844/manuscripts/comm.html#44CC8" target=_blank>Private Property and Communism</a> (1844)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In general it is always empirical businessmen we are talking about when we refer to political economists, (who represent) their <i>scientific </i>creed and form of existence.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1844/manuscripts/needs.html" target=_blank>Human Requirements and Division of Labour</a> (1844)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Under private property ... Each tries to establish over the other an alien power, so as thereby to find satisfaction of his own selfish need. The increase in the quantity of objects is therefore accompanied by an extension of the realm of the alien powers to which man is subjected, and every new product represents a new <i>potentiality</i> of mutual swindling and mutual plundering.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1844/manuscripts/needs.html" target=_blank>Human Requirements and Division of Labour</a> (1844)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Man </i>is directly a <i>natural being</i>. As a natural being and as a living natural being he is on the one hand endowed with <i>natural powers, vital powers </i>— he is an <i>active </i>natural being. These forces exist in him as tendencies and abilities — as <i>instincts</i>. On the other hand, as a natural, corporeal, sensuous objective being he is a <i>suffering</i>, conditioned and limited creature, like animals and plants. ... A being which does not have its nature outside itself is not a <i>natural </i>being, and plays no part in the system of nature. A being which has no object outside itself is not an objective being. <br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1844/manuscripts/hegel.html#44H12" target=_blank>Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy in General</a> (1844)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A few days in my old man’s factory have sufficed to bring me face to face with this beastliness, which I had rather overlooked. ..., it is impossible to carry on communist propaganda on a large scale and at the same time engage in huckstering and industry.<br><br>
Engels, <a href="../../1845/letters/45-01-20.html" target=_blank>Letter to Marx. January 20 1845</a>)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Communism is for us not a <i>state of affairs</i> which is to be established, an <i>ideal</i> to which reality [will] have to adjust itself. We call communism the <i>real </i>movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1845/german-ideology/ch01a.html#p48" target=_blank>German Ideology</a> (1845)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The premises from which we begin are not arbitrary ones, not dogmas, but real premises from which abstraction can only be made in the imagination. They are the real individuals, their activity and the material conditions under which they live, both those which they find already existing and those produced by their activity. These premises can thus be verified in a purely empirical way.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1845/german-ideology/ch01a.html#a2" target=_blank>German Ideology</a> (1845)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Morality, religion, metaphysics, all the rest of ideology and their corresponding forms of consciousness, thus no longer retain the semblance of independence. They have no history, no development; but men, developing their material production and their material intercourse, alter, along with this their real existence, their thinking and the products of their thinking.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1845/german-ideology/ch01a.html#5a4" target=_blank>German Ideology</a> (1845)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We know only a single science, the science of history. One can look at history from two sides and divide it into the history of nature and the history of men. The two sides are, however, inseparable; the history of nature and the history of men are dependent on each other so long as men exist. The history of nature, called natural science, does not concern us here; but we will have to examine the history of men, since almost the whole ideology amounts either to a distorted conception of this history or to a complete abstraction from it. Ideology is itself only one of the aspects of this history.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1845/german-ideology/ch01a.html#science" target=_blank>German Ideology</a> (1845)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1845/german-ideology/ch01a.html#a4" target=_blank>German Ideology</a> (1845)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force. The class which has the means of material production at its disposal, has control at the same time over the means of mental production, so that thereby, generally speaking, the ideas of those who lack the means of mental production are subject to it. The ruling ideas are nothing more than the ideal expression of the dominant material relationships, the dominant material relationships grasped as ideas.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1845/german-ideology/ch01b.html#b3" target=_blank>German Ideology</a> (1845)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For each new class which puts itself in the place of one ruling before it, is compelled, merely in order to carry through its aim, to represent its interest as the common interest of all the members of society, that is, expressed in ideal form: it has to give its ideas the form of universality, and represent them as the only rational, universally valid ones.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1845/german-ideology/ch01b.html#b3" target=_blank>German Ideology</a> (1845)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As far as Feuerbach is a materialist he does not deal with history, and as far as he considers history he is not a materialist.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1845/german-ideology/ch01b.html#5b2" target=_blank>German Ideology</a> (1845)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Both for the production on a mass scale of this communist consciousness, and ... the alteration of men on a mass scale is, necessary, ... a revolution; this revolution is necessary, therefore, not only because the ruling class cannot be overthrown in any other way, but also because the class overthrowing it can only in a revolution succeed in ridding itself of all the muck of ages and become fitted to found society anew.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1845/german-ideology/ch01d.html#d4" target=_blank>German Ideology</a> (1845)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first premise of all human history is, of course, the existence of living human individuals. Thus the first fact to be established is the physical organisation of these individuals and their consequent relation to the rest of nature....Men can be distinguished from animals by consciousness, by religion or anything else you like. They themselves begin to distinguish themselves from animals as soon as they begin to produce their means of subsistence, a step which is conditioned by their physical organisation. By producing their means of subsistence men are indirectly producing their actual material life<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1845/german-ideology/ch01a.html#a2" target=_blank>German Ideology</a> (1845)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The question whether objective truth can be attributed to human thinking is not a question of theory but is a <i>practical</i> question.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1845/theses/theses.html#003" target=_blank>Theses On Feuerbach: Thesis 2</a> (1845)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The materialist doctrine concerning the changing of circumstances and upbringing forgets that circumstances are changed by men and that it is essential to educate the educator himself. This doctrine must, therefore, divide society into two parts, one of which is superior to society.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1845/theses/theses.html#004" target=_blank>Theses On Feuerbach: Thesis 3</a> (1845)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1845/theses/theses.html#018" target=_blank>Theses On Feuerbach: Thesis 11</a> (1845)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of the most difficult tasks confronting philosophers is to descend from the world of thought to the actual world. <i>Language </i>is the immediate actuality of thought. Just as philosophers have given thought an independent existence, so they were bound to make language into an independent realm.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1845/german-ideology/ch03p.html#447" target=_blank>German Ideology, Chapter 3</a> (1846)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>History</i> does <i>nothing</i>, it ‘possesses <i>no</i> immense wealth’, it ‘wages <i>no</i> battles’. It is <i>man</i>, real, living man who does all that, who possesses and fights; ‘history’ is not, as it were, a person apart, using man as a means to achieve <i>its own</i> aims; history is <i>nothing but</i> the activity of man pursuing his aims..<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1845/holy-family/ch06-2.html#history" target=_blank>The Holy Family, Chapter 6</a> (1846)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The productive forces are the result of man’s practical energy, but that energy is in turn circumscribed by the conditions in which man is placed by the productive forces already acquired, by the form of society which exists before him, which he does not create, which is the product of the preceding generation.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1846/letters/46-12-28.html" target=_blank>1846 Letter to Annenkov</a> (1846)</p>

<p>The hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill society with the industrial capitalist.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1847/poverty-philosophy/ch02.html#s2" target=_blank>Poverty of Philosophy</a> (1847)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Economists explain how production takes place in the above-mentioned relations, but what they do not explain is how these relations themselves are produced, that is, the historical movement which gave them birth. M. Proudhon, taking these relations for principles, categories, has merely to put into order these thoughts.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1847/poverty-philosophy/ch02.html#s1" target=_blank>Poverty of Philosophy</a> (1847)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Machines were, it may be said, the weapon employed by the capitalist to quell the revolt of specialized labor.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1847/poverty-philosophy/ch02e.html" target=_blank>Poverty of Philosophy</a> (1847)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The working class, in the course of its development, will substitute for the old civil society an association which will exclude classes and their antagonism, and there will be no more political power properly so-called, since political power is precisely the official expression of antagonism in civil society.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1847/poverty-philosophy/ch02e.html#3b" target=_blank>Poverty of Philosophy</a> (1847)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But in the measure that history moves forward, and with it the struggle of the proletariat assumes clearer outlines, they no longer need to seek science in their minds; they have only to take note of what is happening before their eyes and to become its mouthpiece. So long as they look for science and merely make systems, so long as they are at the beginning of the struggle, they see in poverty nothing but poverty, without seeing in it the revolutionary, subversive side, which will overthrow the old society. From this moment, science, which is a product of the historical movement, has associated itself consciously with it, has ceased to be doctrinaire and has become revolutionary.<br><br>
Marx, <a href="../../1847/poverty-philosophy/ch02.html#a1" target=_blank>Poverty of Philosophy</a> (1847)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The slave frees himself when, of all the relations of private property, he abolishes only the relation of slavery and thereby becomes a proletarian; the proletarian can free himself only by <i>abolishing private property in general</i>.<br><br>
Engels, <a href="../../1847/11/prin-com.html" target=_blank>Principles of Communism</a> (1847)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What is Communism? Communism is the doctrine of the conditions of the liberation of the proletariat.
What is the proletariat? The proletariat is that class in society which lives entirely from the sale of its labor and does not draw profit from any kind of capital; whose weal and woe, whose life and death, whose sole existence depends on the demand for labor....<br><br>
Engels, <a href="../../1847/11/prin-com.html" target=_blank>Principles of Communism</a> (1847)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A nation cannot become free and at the same time continue to oppress other nations. The liberation of Germany cannot therefore take place without the liberation of Poland from German oppression.<br><br>
Engels, <a href="../../1847/12/09.html#engels" target=_blank>Speech on Poland</a> (1847)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Under the freedom of trade the whole severity of the laws of political economy will be applied to the working classes. Is that to say that we are against Free Trade? No, we are for Free Trade, because by Free Trade all economical laws, with their most astounding contradictions, will act upon a larger scale, upon a greater extent of territory, upon the territory of the whole earth; and because from the uniting of all these contradictions into a single group, where they stand face to face, will result the struggle which will itself eventuate in the emancipation of the proletarians.<br><br>
Engels, <a href="../../1847/09/30.html" target=_blank>To Free Trade Congress at Brussels</a> (1847)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And this life activity [the worker] sells to another person in order to secure the necessary means of life. ... He works that he may keep alive.

<p>It seems to be correct to begin with the real and the concrete, with the real precondition, thus to begin, in economics, with e.g. the population, which is the foundation and the subject of the entire social act of production. However, on closer examination this proves false. The population is an <i>abstraction </i>if I leave out, for example, the classes of which it is composed. ... if I were to begin with the population, this would be a chaotic conception of the whole, and I would then, by means of further determination, move analytically towards ever more simple concepts, from the imagined concrete towards ever thinner abstractions until I had arrived at the simplest determinations. From there the journey would have to be retraced until I had finally arrived at the population again, but this time not as the chaotic conception of a whole, but as a rich totality of many determinations and relations.<br><br>

<p>Relations of personal dependence are the first social forms in which human productive capacity develops only to a slight extent and at isolated points. Personal independence founded on objective dependence is the second great form, in which a system of general social metabolism, of universal relations, of all-round needs and universal capacities is formed for the first time. Free individuality, based on the universal development of individuals and on their subordination of their communal, social productivity as their social wealth, is the third stage.<br><br>

<p>Capital and labour relate to each other here like money and commodity; the former is the general form of wealth, the other only the substance destined for immediate consumption. Capital’s ceaseless striving towards the general form of wealth drives labour beyond the limits of its natural paltriness, and thus creates the material elements for the development of the rich individuality which is as all-sided in its production as in its consumption, and whose labour also therefore appears no longer as labour, but as the full development of activity itself, in which natural necessity in its direct form has disappeared; because natural need has been replaced by historically produced need. This is why <i>capital is productive; i.e. an essential relation for the development of the social productive forces. </i>It ceases to exist as such only where the development of these productive forces themselves encounters its barrier in capital itself.<br><br>

<p>The pay of the common soldier is also reduced to a minimum — determined purely by the production costs necessary to procure him. But he exchanges the performance of his services not for <i>capital</i>, but for the revenue of the state.<br>
In bourgeois society itself, all exchange of personal services for revenue — including labour for personal consumption, cooking, sewing etc., garden work etc., up to and including all of the unproductive classes, civil servants, physicians, lawyers, scholars etc. — belongs under this rubric, within this category. All menial servants etc. By means of their services — often coerced — all these workers, from the least to the highest, obtain for themselves a share of the surplus product, of the capitalist’s <i>revenue</i>.<br>
But it does not occur to anyone to think that by means of the exchange of his revenue for such services, i.e. through private consumption, the capitalist posits himself as capitalist. Rather, he thereby spends the fruits of his capital. It does not change the nature of the relation that the proportions in which revenue is exchanged for this kind of living labour are themselves determined by the general laws of production.<br><br>

<p>In every stockjobbing swindle every one knows that some time or other the crash must come, but every one hopes that it may fall on the head of his neighbour, after he himself has caught the shower of gold and placed it in safety. Après moi le déluge! is the watchword of every capitalist and of every capitalist nation. Hence Capital is reckless of the health or length of life of the labourer, unless under compulsion from society.

<p>a schoolmaster is a productive labourer when, in addition to belabouring the heads of his scholars, he works like a horse to enrich the school proprietor. That the latter has laid out his capital in a teaching factory, instead of in a sausage factory, does not alter the relation.<br><br>

<p>That which comes directly face to face with the possessor of money on the market, is in fact not labour, but the labourer. What the latter sells is his labour-power. As soon as his labour actually begins, it has already ceased to belong to him; it can therefore no longer be sold by him. Labour is the substance, and the immanent measure of value, but has itself no value. ... That in their appearance things often represent themselves in inverted form is pretty well known in every science except Political Economy<br><br>

<p>A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois? Should we not, on the contrary, reproach it for not having used it freely enough?<br><br>

<p>Political Economy can remain a science only so long as the class-struggle is latent or manifests itself only in isolated and sporadic phenomena. ... In France and in England the bourgeoisie had conquered political power. Thenceforth, the class-struggle, practically as well as theoretically, took on more and more outspoken and threatening forms. It sounded the knell of scientific bourgeois economy. It was thenceforth no longer a question, whether this theorem or that was true, but whether it was useful to capital or harmful, expedient or inexpedient, politically dangerous or not. In place of disinterested inquirers, there were hired prize fighters; in place of genuine scientific research, the bad conscience and the evil intent of apologetic.<br><br>

<p>Let us not, however, flatter ourselves overmuch on account of our human victories over nature. For each such victory nature takes its revenge on us. Each victory, it is true, in the first place brings about the results we expected, but in the second and third places it has quite different, unforeseen effects which only too often cancel the first. The people who, in Mesopotamia, Greece, Asia Minor and elsewhere, destroyed the forests to obtain cultivable land, never dreamed that by removing along with the forests the collecting centres and reservoirs of moisture they were laying the basis for the present forlorn state of those countries. When the Italians of the Alps used up the pine forests on the southern slopes, so carefully cherished on the northern slopes, they had no inkling that by doing so they were cutting at the roots of the dairy industry in their region; they had still less inkling that they were thereby depriving their mountain springs of water for the greater part of the year, and making it possible for them to pour still more furious torrents on the plains during the rainy seasons. Those who spread the potato in Europe were not aware that with these farinaceous tubers they were at the same time spreading scrofula. Thus at every step we are reminded that we by no means rule over nature like a conqueror over a foreign people, like someone standing outside nature – but that we, with flesh, blood and brain, belong to nature, and exist in its midst, and that all our mastery of it consists in the fact
that we have the advantage over all other creatures of being able to learn its laws and apply them correctly.<br><br>

<p> </p>
<p>Labour is the source of all wealth, the political economists assert. And it really is the source —  next to nature, which supplies it with the material that it converts into wealth. But it is even infinitely more than this. It is the prime basic condition for all human existence, and this to such an extent that, in a sense, we have to say that <i>labour created man himself</i>.<br><br>

<p>When we consider and reflect upon nature at large or the history of mankind or our own intellectual activity, at first we see the picture of an endless entanglement of relations and reactions in which nothing remains what, where and as it was, but everything moves, changes, comes into being and passes away. This primitive, naive but intrinsically correct conception of the world is that of ancient Greek philosophy, and was first clearly formulated by Heraclitus: everything is and is not, for everything is fluid, is constantly changing, constantly coming into being and passing away.<p> </p>
<p>But this conception, correctly as it expresses the general character of the picture of appearances as a whole, does not suffice to explain the details of which this picture is made up, and so long as we do not understand these, we have not a clear idea of the whole picture. In order to understand these details we must detach them from their natural or historical connection and examine each one separately, its nature, special causes, effects, etc.<br><br>

<p>It is becoming equally imperative to bring the individual spheres of knowledge into the correct connection with one another. In doing so, however, natural science enters the field of theory and here the methods of empiricism will not work, here only theoretical thinking can be of assistance. But theoretical thinking is an innate quality only as regards natural capacity. This natural capacity must be developed, improved, and for its improvement there is as yet no other means than the study of previous philosophy.<br><br>

<p>The materialist conception of history starts from the proposition that the production of the means to support human life and, next to production, the exchange of things produced, is the basis of all social structure; that in every society that has appeared in history, the manner in which wealth is distributed and society divided into classes or orders is dependent upon what is produced, how it is produced, and how the products are exchanged. From this point of view, the final causes of all social changes and political revolutions are to be sought, not in men’s brains, not in men’s better insights into eternal truth and justice, but in changes in the modes of production and exchange.<br><br>

<p>The history of the decline of primitive communities (it would be a mistake to place them all on the same level; as in geological formations, these historical forms contain a whole series of primary, secondary, tertiary types, etc.) has still to be written. All we have seen so far are some rather meagre outlines. But in any event the research has advanced far enough to establish that: (1) the vitality of primitive communities was incomparably greater than that of Semitic, Greek, Roman, etc. societies, and, <i>a fortiori</i>, that of modern capitalist societies; (2) the causes of their decline stem from economic facts which prevented them from passing a certain stage of development<br><br>

<p>Just as Darwin discovered the law of development or organic nature, so Marx discovered the law of development of human history: the simple fact, hitherto concealed by an overgrowth of ideology, that mankind must first of all eat, drink, have shelter and clothing, before it can pursue politics, science, art, religion, etc.; that therefore the production of the immediate material means, and consequently the degree of economic development attained by a given people or during a given epoch, form the foundation upon which the state institutions, the legal conceptions, art, and even the ideas on religion, of the people concerned have been evolved, and in the light of which they must, therefore, be explained, instead of vice versa, as had hitherto been the case.<br>

<p>It is, therefore, from the history of nature and human society that the laws of dialectics are abstracted. For they are nothing but the most general laws of these two aspects of historical development, as well as of thought itself.<br>

   The law of the transformation of quantity into quality and vice versa;<br>
   The law of the interpenetration of opposites;<br>
   The law of the negation of the negation.<br>

<p>It was Marx who had first discovered the great law of motion of history, the law according to which all historical struggles, whether they proceed in the political, religious, philosophical or some other ideological domain, are in fact only the more or less clear expression of struggles of social classes, and that the existence and thereby the collisions, too, between these classes are in turn conditioned by the degree of development of their economic position, by the mode of their production and of their exchange determined by it. This law, which has the same significance for history as the law of the transformation of energy has for natural science.<br><br>
Engels, <a href="../../1885/prefaces/18th-brumaire.html" target=_blank>Preface to The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte</a> (1885)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The economic facts, which have so far played no role or only a contemptible one in the writing of history, are, at least in the modern world, a decisive historical force; that they form the basis of the origination of the present-day class antagonisms; that these class antagonisms, in the countries where they have become fully developed, thanks to large-scale industry, hence especially in England, are in their turn the basis of the formation of political parties and of party struggles, and thus of all political history. Marx had not only arrived at the same view, but had already, in the <i>Deutsche-Französische Jahrbücher</i> (1844), generalized it to the effect that, speaking generally, it is not the state which conditions and regulates the civil society at all, but civil society which conditions and regulates the state, and, consequently, that policy and its history are to be explained from the economic relations and their development, and not vice versa.<br><br>

<p>The doctrine of Hegel, taken as a whole, left plenty of room for giving shelter to the most diverse practical party views. And in the theoretical Germany of that time, two things above all were practical: religion and politics. Whoever placed the chief emphasis on the Hegelian system could be fairly conservative in both spheres; whoever regarded the dialectical method as the main thing could belong to the most extreme opposition, both in politics and religion.<br><br>
Engels, <a href="../../1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch01.html" target=_blank>Ludwig Feuerbach &amp; the End of Classical German Philosophy</a> (1886)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The great basic question of all philosophy, especially of more recent philosophy, is that concerning the relation of thinking and being. ... <br>
The answers which the philosophers gave to this question split them into two great camps. Those who asserted the primacy of spirit to nature and, therefore, in the last instance, assumed world creation in some form or other — and among the philosophers, Hegel, for example, this creation often becomes still more intricate and impossible than in Christianity — comprised the camp of <i>idealism</i>. The others, who regarded nature as primary, belong to the various schools of <i>materialism</i>.<br><br>
Engels, <a href="../../1886/ludwig-feuerbach/ch02.html" target=_blank>Ludwig Feuerbach &amp; the End of Classical German Philosophy</a> (1886)</p>

<p>That which is willed happens but rarely; in the majority of instances the numerous desired ends cross and conflict with one another, or these ends themselves are from the outset incapable of realisation, or the means of attaining them are insufficient. thus the conflicts of innumerable individual wills and individual actions in the domain of history produce a state of affairs entirely analogous to that prevailing in the realm of unconscious nature.<br><br>

<p>The only war left for Prussia-Germany to wage will be a world war, a world war, moreover of an extent the violence hitherto unimagined. Eight to ten million soldiers will be at each other’s throats and in the process they will strip Europe barer than a swarm of locusts. The depredations of the Years’ War compressed into three to four years and extended over the entire continent; famine, disease, the universal lapse into barbarism.<br><br>

<p>According to the materialist conception of history, the <i>ultimately</i> determining element in history is the production and reproduction of real life. Other than this neither Marx nor I have ever asserted. Hence if somebody twists this into saying that the economic element is the <i>only</i> determining one, he transforms that proposition into a meaningless, abstract, senseless phrase.<br>

<p>To my mind, the so-called ‘socialist society’ is not anything immutable. Like all other social formations, it should be conceived in a state of constant flux and change. It’s crucial difference from the present order consists naturally in production organized on the basis of common ownership by the nation of all means of production. To begin this reorganization tomorrow, but performing it gradually, seems to me quite feasible. That our workers are capable of it is borne out by their many producer and consumer cooperatives which, whenever they’re not deliberately ruined by the police, are equally well and far more honestly run than the bourgeois stock companies.<br><br>

<p>The day when we are in the majority, what the French army did instinctively in not firing on the people will be repeated in our country quite consciously. Yes, whatever the frightened bourgeois say, we are able to calculate the moment when we shall have the majority of the people behind us; our ideas are making headway everywhere, as much among teachers, doctors, lawyers, etc. as among the workers. If we had to start wielding power tomorrow, we should need engineers, chemists, agronomists. Well, it is my conviction that we would have a good many of them behind us already. In five or ten years we shall have more of them than we need.<br><br>

<p>Just as the savage must wrestle with Nature to satisfy his wants, to maintain and reproduce life, so must civilised man, and he must do so in all social formations and under all possible modes of production. With his development this realm of physical necessity expands as a result of his wants; but, at the same time, the forces of production which satisfy these wants also increase. Freedom in this field can only consist in socialised man, the associated producers, rationally regulating their interchange with Nature, bringing it under their common control, instead of being ruled by it as by the blind forces of Nature; and achieving this with the least expenditure of energy and under conditions most favourable to, and worthy of, their human nature. But it nonetheless still remains a realm of necessity. Beyond it begins that development of human energy which is an end in itself, the true realm of freedom, which, however, can blossom forth only with this realm of necessity as its basis. The shortening of the working-day is its basic prerequisite.<br><br>

<p>What we understand by the economic conditions which we regard as the determining basis of the history of society are the methods by which human beings in a given society produce their means of subsistence and exchange the products among themselves (in so far as division of labour exists). Thus the <i>entire technique </i>of production and transport is here included. According to our conception, this technique also determines the method of exchange and, further, the division of products, ...<br><br>

On most of the many “Famous Quotes” pages on the Internet, quotes from Marx, Engels, Lenin and other Marxists are invariably unsourced and in very many cases they are deliberately-propagated misinformation, unthinkingly copied form one site to the next. The Marxists Internet Archive contains almost all the writings of the founders of Communism, so if you can’t find a quote on this site, then it is probably bogus. <a href="../../../../../admin/volunteers/biographies/ablunden.html" target=_blank>Write us</a> if you are in doubt.</p>

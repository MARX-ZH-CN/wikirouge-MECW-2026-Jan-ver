<p class="fst"><i>Cologne, </i>May 15. No sooner had the Holy Alliance of the knout imposed a brand-new state-of-siege Constitution on Prussia than it favoured us today with a second document of no less interest. Those nationally-assembled milksops of Frankfurt, who by their radical philistinism, cowardice and doltishness so faithfully assisted the paid traitors of the German people for a whole year in working for the counter-revolution, are now reaping what they sowed.<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume09/footnote.html#357" target=_blank>[357]</a></sup> If it were possible for some glimmer of light to occur in the minds of our National Assembly deputies, and for their breasts to be filled not merely with indignation inspired by March beer, but at least with a small degree of <i>revolutionary indignation and energy</i>, then that ought to be effected by the following “royal order” of the subordinate <i>knyaz</i> in Charlottenburg<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume09/footnote.html#358" target=_blank>[358]</a></sup>:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“<i> Royal Order</i><br>
"We, Frederick William, by the grace of God King of Prussia etc. etc., hereby, on the proposal of our Ministry, order the following:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><b>§1</b><br>
"<b>The mandate of the deputies elected in the Prussian state to the German National Assembly on the basis of the Decrees of the German Confederation of March 30 and April 7, 1848, and of Our Order of April 11, 1848, has ceased to be valid.</b></p>
<p class="quoteb"><b>§2</b><br>
"<b>This Our present Order is to be put before the deputies by Our Plenipotentiary in Frankfurt am Main for their guidance and with the directive to refrain from any participation in the further proceedings of the Assembly</b>.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“Given in Charlottenburg, May 14, 1849</p>

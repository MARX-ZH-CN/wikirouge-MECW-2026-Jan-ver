<h3>1. COMMODITIES AS SUCH</h3>
<p> 
The wealth of societies in which capitalist production prevails consists 
of <i>commodities</i>.  A commodity is a thing that has <i>use-value</i>; the latter 
exists in all forms of society, but in capitalist society, use-value is, 
in addition, the material depository of exchange-value.  
</p>
<p>
Exchange-value presupposes a <i>tertium comparationis</i> by which it is measured; labor, 
the common social substance of exchange-values, to be precise, the 
<i>socially necessary labor-time</i> embodied in them.  
 </p>
<p>
Just as a commodity is something twofold: use-value and exchange-value, so the labour contained in it is two-fold determined: 
 
<ul class="disc">
<li>on the one hand, as definite productive activity, weaving  
        labour, tailoring labour, etc.  — "useful labour";</li>
<li>on the other, as the simple expenditure of human labour-power, 
        precipitated abstract (general) labour. </li>
</ul>
<p>
The former produces use-value, the latter exchange-value; only the 
latter is quantitatively comparable (the differences between skilled and 
unskilled, composite and simple labour confirm this).  
 </p>
<p>
Hence, the substance of exchange-value is abstract labour and its 
magnitude is the measure of time of abstract labour.  Now, to consider 
the form of exchange-value.  
 
<p class="equation">
     (1) x commodity a = y commodity b; 
</p>
<p>
The value of a commodity in the use-value of another is its relative 
value.  The expression of the equivalence of two commodities is the 
simple form of relative value.  In the above equation, y commodity b is 
the <i>equivalent</i>.  In it, x commodity a acquires it value-form in 
contrast to its (the commodity's) natural form, while y commodity b 
acquires, at the same time, the property of direct exchangeability, even 
in its natural form.  Exchange-value is impressed upon the use-value of 
a commodity by definite historical relations.  Hence, the commodity 
cannot express its exchange-value in its own use-value, but only in the 
use-value of another commodity.  Only in the equation of two concrete 
products of labour does the property of the concrete labour contained in 
both come to light as abstract human labour <i>i.e.</i>, a commodity cannot 
be related to the concrete labour contained in itself, as the mere form 
of realization of abstract labour, but it can be so related to the 
concrete labour contained in other kinds of commodities.  
 </p>
<p>
The equation x commodity a = y commodity b necessarily implies that x 
commodity a can also be expressed in other commodities, thus: 
 
<p class="equation">
     (2) x commodity a = y commodity b = x commodity c = u commodity d = 
         u commodity e = etc., etc.  
 </p>
<p>
This is the expanded relative form of value.  Here, x commodity a no 
longer refers to one, but to all commodities as the mere phenomenal 
forms of the labour represented in it.  But, through simple reversal, it 
leads to 
 
<p class="equation">
     (3) the converse second form of relative value: 
<p class="equation">
                      y commodity b = x commodity a 
<p class="equation">
                      v commodity c = x commodity a 
<p class="equation">
                      u commodity d = x commodity a 
<p class="equation">
                      t commodity e = x commodity a 
<p class="equation">
etc., etc. 
 </p>
<p>
Here, the commodities are given the general relative form of value, in 
which all of them are abstracted from their use-values and equated to x 
commodity a as the materialization of abstract labour; x commodity a is 
the generic form of the equivalent for all other commodities; it is 
their universal equivalent; the labour materialized in it represents in 
itself the realization of abstract labour, labour in general.  Now, 
however, 

<p class="equation">
     (4) every commodity of the series can take over the role of 
         universal equivalent, but only one of them can do so at a time, 
         since if all commodities were universal equivalents, each of 
         them would in turn exclude the others from that role.   
 </p>
<p>
Form 3 is not obtained by x commodity a, but by the other commodities, 
objectively.  Hence, a definite commodity must take over for the role — 
for a time, it can change — and only in this way does a commodity 
become a commodity completely.  This special commodity, with whose 
natural form the general equivalent form becomes identified, is money.  
</p>
<p>
The difficulty with a commodity is that, like all categories of the 
capitalist mode of production, it represents a personal relationship 
under a material wrapping.  The producers relate their different kinds 
of labour to one another as general human labour by relating their 
products to one another as commodities — they cannot accomplish it 
without this mediation of things.  The relation of persons thus appears 
as the relation of things.  
 </p>
<p>
For a society in which commodity production prevails, Christianity, 
particularly Protestantism, is the fitting religion.  
 

<a id="2"></a>
<h3> 2.  THE PROCESS OF COMMODITY EXCHANGE </h3>
<p>
A commodity proves that it is a commodity in exchange.  The owners of 
two commodities must be willing to exchange their respective commodities 
and, therefore, to recognise each other as private owners.  This legal 
relation, the form of which is the contract, is only a relation of 
wills, reflecting the economic relation.  Its content is given by the 
economic relation itself.  (P.45 [84]) 
 </p>
<p>
A commodity is a use-value for its non-owner, a non-use-value for its 
owner.  Hence, the need for exchange.  But, every commodity owner wants 
to get in exchange specific use-values that he needs, to that extent, 
the exchange is an individual process.  On the other hand, he wants to 
realise his commodity as value, that is, in any commodity, whether or 
not <i>his</i> commodity is use-value to the owner of the other commodity.  
To that extent, the exchange is for him a generally social process.  
But, one and the same process cannot be simultaneously both individual 
and generally social for all commodity owners.  Every commodity owner 
considers his own commodity as the universal equivalent, while all other 
commodities are so many particular equivalents of his own.  Since all 
commodity owners do the same, no commodity is the universal equivalent, 
and, hence, no commodities posses a general relative form of value, in 
which they are equated as values and compared as magnitudes of value.  
Therefore, they do not confront each other at all as commodities, but 
only as products.  (P.47 [86]) 
 
 <p>
Commodities can be related as values and, hence, as commodities only by 
comparison with some other commodity as the universal equivalent.  But 
only the social act can make a particular commodity the universal 
equivalent — money.  
 
 <p>
The immanent contradiction in a commodity as the direct unity of 
use-value and exchange-value, as the product of useful private labour...  
and as the direct social materialization of abstract human labour — this 
contradiction finds no rest until it results in duplicating the 
commodity into commodity and money.  (P.48 [87]) 
 
 <p>
Since all other commodities are merely particular equivalents of money, 
and money is their universal equivalent, they are related to money as 
particular commodities to the universal commodity.  (P.51 [89]) The 
process of exchange gives the commodity which it converts into money, 
not its value, but its value-form.  (P.51 [89]) Fetishism (belief in a 
supernatural power of objects): a commodity does not seem to become 
money only because the other commodities all express their values in it, 
but, conversely, they seem to express their values in it because it is 
money.  


<a id="3"></a>
<h3>3.  MONEY, OR THE CIRCULATION OF COMMODITIES </h3>
<a id="A"></a>
<h5>A.  The Measure of Values<br>
(Assuming Gold = Money)</h5>
<p>
Money, as the measure of value, is the necessary phenomenal form of the 
measure of value immanent in commodities — i.e., labour-time.  The 
simple, relative expression of the value of commodities in money, x 
commodity a = y money, is their price.  (P.55 [95]) 
 
 <p>
The price of a commodity, its money-form, is expressed in imaginary 
money; hence, money is the measure of values only ideally.  (P.57 [95]) 
 
 <p>
Once the change from value to price is effected, it becomes technically 
necessary to develop the measure of values further, into the standard of 
price — i.e., a quantity of gold is fixed, by which different 
quantities of gold are measured.  This is quite different from the 
measure of values, which itself depends upon the value of gold, while 
the latter is immaterial for the standard of prices.  (P.59 [97-98]) 
 
 <p>
Once prices are expressed in accounting names of gold, money serves as 
money of account.  
 
 <p>
If price, as the exponent of the magnitude of a commodity's value, is 
the exponent of its exchange ratio with money, it does not follow 
conversely that the exponent of its exchange ratio with money is 
necessarily the exponent of the magnitude of its value.  Assuming that 
circumstances permit or compel the sale of a commodity above or below 
its value, these selling prices do not correspond to its value, but they 
are none the less prices of the commodity, for they are 
 
 <p class="equation">
     (1) its value-form money, and 
 
     (2) exponents of its exchange ratio with money. 
 </p>
<p>
The possibility, therefore, of quantities incongruity between price and 
magnitude of value is given in the price-form itself.  That is no defect 
of this form, but on the contrary makes it the adequate form of a mode 
of production in which the rule can impose itself only as a 
blindly-acting law of averages of irregularity.  The price-form, 
however, can also harbour a qualitative contradiction, so that price 
ceases altogether to be an expression of value....  Conscience, honour, 
etc., can...  acquire the form of commodities through their price.  
(P.61 [102]) 
 
 <p>
Measurement of values in money, the price-form, implies the necessity of 
alienation, the ideal pricing implies the actual.  Hence, circulation.  
 
 
<a id="B"></a>
<h5>B.  The Medium of Circulation</h5>
<a id="B.a"></a>
<p>
a. The Metamorphosis of Commodities

 
 <p>
 Simple form:  C - M - C. 
 
 <p>
Its material content C = C.  Exchange-value is alienated and use-value 
appropriated.  
 </p>
<p>
A.  First phase: C - M = sale, for which two persons are required, hence 
the possibility of failure — i.e., of sale below value, or even below 
the cost of production, if the social value of the commodity changes.  
 
 <p class="quote">
     "The division of labour converts the product of labour into a 
     commodity, and thereby makes necessary its further conversion  
     into money." 
 </p>
<p>
At the same time, it also make the accomplishment of this 
transubstantiation quite accidental.  (P.67 [108]) But, considering the 
phenomenon in its pure form, C - M presupposes that the possessor of the 
money (unless he is a producer of gold) previously got his money through 
exchange for other commodities; hence, it is not only conversely M - C 
for the buyer, but it presupposes that he made a previous sale, etc., so 
that we have an endless series of purchases and sales.  
 </p>
<p>
B.  The same takes place i the second phase, M - C — i.e., purchase, 
which is, at the same time, a sale for the other party.  
 </p>
<p>
C.  The total process, hence, is a circuit of purchases and sales.  The 
circulation of commodities.  This is quite different from the direct 
exchange of products; first, the individual and local bounds of the 
direct exchange of products are broken through, and the metabolism of 
human labour is made possible; on the other hand, here it already appears 
that the whole process depends upon social relations spontaneous in 
their growth and independent of the actors.  (P.72 [112]) Simple 
exchange was extinguished in the one act of exchange, where each 
exchanges non-use-value for use-value; circulation proceeds 
indefinitely.  (P.73 [112]) 
 
 <p>
Here the false economic dogma: the circulation of commodities involves a 
necessary equilibrium of purchases and sales, because every purchase is 
also a sale, and vice versa — which is to say, that every seller also 
brings his buyer to market with him.  
 
 <p class="quote">
     (1) Purchase and sale are, on the one hand, an identical act of 
         two polarly opposite persons (poles are the two ends of the 
         axis of a sphere); on the other hand, they are two polarly 
         opposite acts of one and the same person.  Hence, the identity 
         of purchases and sale implies that the commodity is useless 
         unless it is sold, and likewise that this case can occur.  
 </p>
<p class="quote">
     (2) C - M, as a partial process, is similarly an independent 
         process and implies that the acquirer of money can choose the 
         time when he again converts this money into a commodity.  He 
         can wait.  
 </p>
<p>
The inner unity of the independent processes C - M and M - C moves in 
external antitheses precisely because of the independence of these 
processes; and when these dependent processes reach a certain limit of 
independence, their unity asserts itself in a crisis.  Hence, the 
possibility of the latter is already given here.  
 
 <p>
Being the intermediary in commodity circulation, money is the medium of 
circulation.  

 
<a id="B.b"></a>
<p>
b. The Currency of Money

 
 <p>
Money is the medium by which each individual commodity goes into, and 
out of, circulation; it always remains therein itself.  Hence, although 
the circulation of money is merely the expression of commodity 
circulation, the circulation of commodities appears to be the result of 
money circulation.  Since money always remains within the sphere of 
circulation, the question is: how much money is present in it? 
 
 <p>
The quantity of money in circulation is determined by the sum prices of 
commodities (money-value remaining the same), and the latter by the 
quantity of commodities in circulation.  Assuming that this quantity of 
commodities is given, the circulating quantity of money fluctuates with 
the fluctuations in the price of commodities.  Now, since one and the 
same coin always mediates a number of transactions in succession in a 
given time, for a given interval of time, we have: 
</p>
<table align="center" border="0">
<tr>
<td align="Center">Sum of the prices of commodities</td>
<td width="25"></td>
<td width="50"></td>
<td align="Center">Quantity of money functioning</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="Center">—————————————————————</td>
<td></td>
<td>=</td>
<td align="Center">as the circulated medium</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="Center">Number of moves made by a piece of money</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td align="Center">(P. 80 [120])</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> 
Hence, paper money can displace gold money if it is thrown into a 
saturated circulation.  
 
 <p>
Since the currency of money only <i>reflects</i> the process of commodity 
circulation, its rapidity reflects that of the change in the form of the 
commodities, its stagnation, the separation of purchase from sale, the 
stagnation of social metabolism.  The origin of this stagnation cannot, 
of course, be seen from circulation itself, which puts in evidence only 
the phenomenon.  The philistines attribute it to a deficient quantity of 
circulating medium.  (P.81 [121]) 
 
 <p>
Ergo: 
 
 <p class="quote">
     (1) If the prices of commodities remains constant, the quantity of 
         money circulating rises when the quantity of circulating 
         commodities increased or the circulation of money is retarded; 
         and drops vice versa.  
 
  <p class="quote">
     (2) With a general rise in the prices of commodities, the quantity 
         of money circulating remains constant if the quantity of 
         commodities decreased or the velocity of circulation increases 
         in the same proportion.  
 
  <p class="quote">
     (3) With a general drop in the prices of commodities, the converse 
         of (2). 
 
 <p>
In general, there is a fairly constant average from which appreciable 
deviations occur almost exclusively as a result of crises.  
  
 <a id="B.c"> </a></p>
<p>
c. Coin. Symbols of Value

 </p>
<p>
The standard of prices is fixed by the state, as are also the 
denomination of the particular piece of gold — the coin, and its 
coining.  In the world market, the respective national uniforms are 
doffed again (Seigniorage is disregarded here), so that coin and bullion 
differ only in form.  But a coin wears away during circulation; gold, as 
a circulating medium, differs from gold as a standard of prices.  The 
coin becomes more and more a <i>symbol</i> of its official content.  
 </p>
<p>
Herewith, the latent possibility is given of replacing metallic money by 
tokens or symbols.  Hence: 
 
 <p class="quote">
     (1) small coinage of copper and silver tokens, the permanent 
         establishment of which in place of real gold money is prevented 
         by limiting the quantity in which they are legal tender.   
  <p class="quote">
         Their metallic content is determined purely arbitrarily by law, 
         and thus their function as coinage becomes independent of their 
         value.  Hence, the further step to quite worthless symbols is 
         possible: 
  <p class="quote">
     (2) paper money — i.e., paper money issued by the state, having 
         compulsory circulation.  (Credit money not to be discussed here 
         as yet.) 
 
 <p>
So far as this paper money actually circulates in place of gold money, 
it is subject to the laws of money circulation.  Only the proportion in 
which paper replaces gold can be the object of a special law, which is: 
that the issue of paper money is to be limited to the quantity in which 
the gold represented by it would actually have to circulate.  The degree 
of saturation of circulation fluctuates, but everywhere experience 
determines a minimum below which it never falls.  This minimum can be 
issued.  If more than the minimum is issued, a portion becomes 
superfluous as soon as the degree of saturation drops to the minimum.  
In that case, the total amount of paper money within the commodity world 
still represents only the quantity of gold fixed by that world's 
immanent laws, and hence alone representable.  Thus, if the amount of 
paper money represents twice the absorbable amount of gold, each piece 
of paper money is depreciated to half its nominal value.  Just as if 
gold were changed in its function as the measure of prices, in its 
value.  (P.89 [128]) 
 
 
<a id="C"></a>
<h5>
C.  Money  
</h5>
<a id="C.a"></a>
<p>
a.  Hoarding

 </p>
<p>
With the earliest development of commodity circulation, there develops 
the need, and the passionate desire, to hold fast the product of C - M, 
money.  From a mere agency of change of matter, this change of form 
becomes an end in itself.  Money petrifies into a hoard; the commodity 
seller becomes a money hoarder.  (P.91 [130]) 
 </p>
<p>
This form was dominant precisely in the beginnings of commodity 
circulation.  Asia.  With further development of commodity circulation, 
every producer of commodities must secure for himself the nexus rerum, 
the social pledge-money.  Thus, hoards accumulate everywhere.  The 
development of commodity circulation increases the power of money, the 
absolutely social form of wealth, always ready for use.  (P.92 [131]) 
The urge for hoarding is, by nature, boundless.  Qualitatively, or with 
respect to its form, money is unrestricted — i.e., the universal 
representative of material wealth — because it is directly convertible 
into any commodity.  But, quantitatively, every actual sum of money is 
limited — and, therefore, of only limited efficacy as a means of 
purchasing.  This contradiction always drives the hoarder back, again 
and again, to the Sisyphus-like (vain) labour of accumulation.  
 </p>
<p>
Besides, the accumulation of gold and silver in plate creates both a new 
market for these metals and a latent source of money.  
 </p>
<p>
Hoarding serves as a conduit for supplying or withdrawing circulating 
money with the continuous fluctuations in the degree of saturation of 
the circulation.  (P.95 [134]) 
  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a id="C.b"></a></p>
<p>
b.  Means of Payment 

 </p>
<p>
With the development of commodity circulation, new conditions appear: 
the alienation of a commodity can be separated in time from the 
realization of its price.  Commodities require different periods of time 
for their production; they are produced in different seasons; some must 
be sent to distant markets, etc.  Hence, A can be a seller before B, the 
buyer, is able to pay.  Practice regulates the conditions of payment in 
this way: A becomes a creditor, B a debtor: money becomes a means of 
payment.  Thus, the relation of creditor and debtor already becomes more 
antagonistic.  (This can also occur independently of commodity 
circulation — e.g., in antiquity and the Middle Ages.) (P.97 [135]) 
 </p>
<p>
In this relation, money functions: 
 
 <p class="quote">
     (1) as the measure of value in the determination of the price of 
         the commodity sold; 
 
 <p class="quote">
     (2) as an ideal means of purchase. 
 </p>
<p>
In the hoard, money was withdrawn from circulation; here, being a means 
of payment, money enters circulation, but only after the commodity has 
left it.  The indebted buyer sells in order to be able to <i>pay</i>, or he 
will be put up for auction.  Therefore, money now becomes the sale's end 
in itself through a social necessity arising out of the relations of the 
very circulation process.  (Pp.97-98 [136]) 
 </p>
<p>
The lack of simultaneity of purchases and sales, which gives rise to the 
function of money as a means of payment, at the same time effects an 
economy of the circulation media, payments being concentrated at a 
definite place.  The virements (remittance by draft from own account to 
another) in Lyons in the Middle Ages — a sort of clearing-house, where 
only the net balance of the mutual claims is paid.  (P.98 [137]) 
 </p>
<p>
Insofar as the payments balance one another, money functions only 
ideally, as money of account or measure of values.  Insofar as actual 
payment has to be made, it does not appear as a circulating medium, as 
only the vanishing and mediating form of metabolism, but as the 
individual embodiment of social labour, as the independent existence of 
exchange-value, as the absolute commodity.  This direct contradiction 
breaks out in that phase of production and commercial crises that is 
called a monetary crisis.  It occurs only where the progressing chain of 
payments, and an artificial system of settling them, are fully 
developed.  With more general disturbances of this mechanism, no matter 
what their origin, money changes suddenly and immediately from its 
merely ideal shape of money of account into hard cash; profane 
commodities can no longer replace it.  (P.99 [138]) 
 </p>
<p>
Credit money originates in the function of money as a means of payment; 
certificates of debt themselves circulate, in turn, to transfer these 
debts to others.  With the system of credit, the function of money as a 
means of payment again expands; in that capacity, money acquires its own 
forms of existence, in which it occupies the sphere of large-scale 
commercial transactions, while coin is largely relegated to the sphere 
of retail trade.  (P.101 [139-40]) 
 </p>
<p>
At a certain stage and volume of commodity production, the function of 
money-as-a-means-of-payment spreads beyond the sphere of the circulation 
of commodities; it becomes the universal commodity of contracts.  Rents, 
taxes, and the like, are transformed from payments in kind into money 
payments.  Cf.  France under Louis XIV.  (Boisguillebert and Vauban); on 
the other hand, Asia, Turkey, Japan, etc.  (P.102 [140-41]) 
 </p>
<p>
The development of money into a means of payment necessitates the 
accumulation of money against the date when payment is due.  Hoarding, 
which, as a distinct form of acquiring riches, vanished as society 
further developed, again appears as a reserve fund of the means of 
payment.  (P.103 [142]) 
 
<a id="C.c"></a></p>
<p>
c.  Universal Money 

 </p>
<p>
In world trade, the local forms of coin — small coinage, and paper 
money — are discarded and only the bullion form of money is valid as 
universal money.  Only in the world market does money function to the 
full extent as the commodity whose bodily form is at the same time the 
immediate social incarnation of human labour in the abstract.  Its mode 
of existence becomes adequate to its concept.  (Pp.103-04 [142]; details

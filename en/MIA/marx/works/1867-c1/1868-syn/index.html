This is a synopsis of <a href="../../1867-c1/index.html" target=_blank>Capital, Volume I</a>, written by Engels in 1868. Upon <i>Capital</i>'s release, Engels
began constructing a comprehensive summation.
</p>
<p>
On April 17, 1868, he wrote Marx: "I have a limited time at my
disposal and the summarising of your book requires more work than I thought;
after all, once having taken up the work, I must do it properly...." Engels'
synopsis serves two useful contributions: First, Engels was a far more
rapid writer than Marx, and more readable. Second, Engels could distance himself
from the massive web of ideas without "losing his place in it", and identify
primary points to be made.
</p>
<p>
Engels could achieve this because he was <a href="../../../letters/index.html" target=_blank>intimately involved</a> with the production of <i>Capital</i>. Marx forwarded sheets to Engels as they were printed; Engels
sent back his impressions and thoughts.
</p>
<p>
This text was published in <i>Fortnightly Review.</i> Engels only summarized
the first four chapters of Volume I of <i>Capital</i>.
</p>
<p>
NOTE: In the first edition, Volume I was divided into six chapters.
Subsequent editions renamed these chapters "parts". The 5th chapter was
broken into two parts; so that a total of seven parts resulted. The four
chapters summarized by Engels therefore correspond to the first four parts
of <i>Capital</i> as found today. Also note Marx made additions and alterations
to the text in subsequent editions. For example, Marx did not dwell in
the 1st chapter/part (Commodities) on value and exchange-value — so Engels'
synopsis doesn't deal with that subject, which is today integral to chapter one.
</p>
<p>
In the Progress Publishers introduction, we find:

<p class="quote">
The reviews and the synopsis made by Engels are inestimable aids to
the study of <i>Capital</i>. The contents of <i>Capital</i> are given for
the greater part in Marx's own words.
</p>
<p class="quote">
The centre of gravity, in the synopsis, as well as in the reviews,
lies in the <i>theory of surplus-value</i>, the corner-stone of Marx's
economic doctrine. Engels summarized Marx's theory of surplus-value with
special care, characterizing in detail the historical circumstances in
which the relations of capital exploitation spread, the working class made
its first steps in the struggle and the first skirmishes took place between
labor and capital.
</p>
<p class="quote">
Engels' synopsis that the transition from one category to another
is not a freak of reason but the reflection of the real historic process
of development. Keeping to the order of Marx's exposition, he shows how,
in the course of historic development, capital emerged on the basis of
commodity production, how it subordinated to itself the whole of production,
how simple co-operation was replaced by manufacture and this, in turn,
by machine production.

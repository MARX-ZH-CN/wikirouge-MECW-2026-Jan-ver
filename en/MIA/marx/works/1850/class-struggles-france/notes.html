<p class="title">Class Struggles in France 1848-1850</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p class="information"><a id="n64"><span class="info">64.</span></a> The
<i>Paris uprising of June 5 and 6, 1832, </i>was prepared by the Left
republicans and by secret revolutionary societies including the Society of the
Friends of the People. The uprising flared up during the funeral of General
Lamarque, an opponent of Louis Philippe’s Government. The insurgent
workers threw up barricades and defended them with great courage; the red flag
was hoisted over them for the first time.</p>
<p class="information">The <i>uprising of Lyons workers in April 1834,
</i>directed by the secret republican Society of the Rights of Man and the
Citizen, was one of the first mass actions by the French proletariat. The
uprising, supported by republicans in several other towns including Paris, was
brutally suppressed.</p>
<p class="information">The <i>Paris uprising of May 12, 1839, </i>in which
the revolutionary workers played a leading part, was prepared by the secret
republican socialist Society of the Seasons led by Auguste Blanqui and Armand
Barbès; it was suppressed by troops and the National Guard, </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n65"><span class="info">65.</span></a>
<i>Robert Macaire – </i>a character portraying a clever swindler,
created by the famous French actor Frederick Lemaître and immortalised in the
caricatures of Honoré Daumier. The figure of Robert Macaire was a biting satire
on the domination of the financial aristocracy under the July monarchy. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n66"><span class="info">66.</span></a> The
reference is to the repercussions of the suppression of the uprising in the
free city of Cracow (the Cracow Republic) which, by decision of the Congress of
Vienna, came under the joint control of Austria, Prussia and Russia, who had
partitioned Poland at the end of the eighteenth century. The insurgents
succeeded in seizing power in Cracow on February 22, 1846, established a
National Government of the Polish Republic and issued a manifesto abolishing
feudal services. The Cracow uprising was suppressed at the beginning of March;
in November 1846, Austria, Prussia and Russia signed a treaty incorporating
Cracow into the Austrian Empire.</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n67"><span class="info">67.</span></a> In the
spring of 1847 at Buzaruçais (department of the Indre) the starving workers and
the inhabitants of neighbouring villages looted storehouses belonging to
profiteers, which led to a clash between the population and troops. Four of
those who took part were executed and many others sentenced to hard labour. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n68"><span class="info">68.</span></a> The
<i>dynastic opposition</i> – an opposition group in the French Chamber
of Deputies during the July monarchy (1830-48). The group, headed by Odilon
Barrot, expressed the sentiments of the liberal industrial and commercial
bourgeoisie and favoured a moderate electoral reform, which they regarded as a
means to prevent revolution and preserve the Orleans dynasty.</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n70"><span class="info">70.</span></a> During
the first days of the revolution, the workers of Paris demanded that the French
Republic’s flag should be red, the colour of that hoisted in the
workers’ suburbs of Paris during the June uprising of 1832. Bourgeois
representatives insisted on the tricolour (blue-white-and-red) which had been
the national standard during the French Revolution and under Napoleon I. It had
been the emblem of the bourgeois republicans grouped around the newspaper
<i>National</i> even before 1848. In the end, the tricolour was accepted as
the national standard with a red rosette fixed to the flagstaff; later, the
rosette was removed. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n71"><span class="info">71.</span></a> In 1848
<i>Le Moniteur universel </i>printed reports on the sittings of the
Luxembourg Commission alongside official documents. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n72"><span class="info">72.</span></a> The
reference is to the sum assigned by the King in 1825 as compensation for
aristocrats whose property had been confiscated during the French Revolution,
</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n73"><span class="info">73.</span></a> The
<i>Mobile Guards, </i>set up by a decree of the Provisional Government on
February 25, 1848, with the secret aim of fighting the revolutionary masses,
were used to crush the June uprising of the Paris workers. Later they were
disbanded on the insistence of Bonapartist circles, who feared that if a
conflict arose between Louis Bonaparte and the republicans, the Mobile Guards
would side with the latter. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n74"><span class="info">74.</span></a>
<i>Lazzaroni</i> – a contemptuous nickname for declassed proletarians,
primarily in the Kingdom of Naples, who were repeatedly used in the struggle
against the liberal and democratic movement. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n75"><span class="info">75.</span></a> The Poor
Law adopted in England in 1834 provided for only one form of relief for the
able-bodied poor: workhouses with a prison-like regime in which the workers
were engaged in unproductive, monotonous and exhausting labour. The people
called these workhouses “Bastilles for the poor.” Here and later
Marx uses the English word “workhouses.” </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n76"><span class="info">76.</span></a> The
reference is to the elections to the National Guard and the Constituent
Assembly which were to be held on March 18 and April 9, 1848, respectively.
Paris workers, grouped around Blanqui, Dézamy and others, insisted on a
postponement of the elections arguing that they should be prepared by thorough
explanatory work among the population. As a result of the popular demonstration
on March 17 in Paris, regular troops were withdrawn from the capital (after the
events of April 16 they were brought back), and elections to the National Guard
were postponed till April 5 and to the Constituent Assembly till April 23. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n78"><span class="info">78.</span></a>
<i>Commission du pouvoir executif </i>(the Executive Commission) – the
Government of the French Republic set up by the Constituent Assembly on May 10,
1848, to replace the Provisional Government which had resigned. It existed
until June 24, 1848, when Cavaignac’s dictatorship was established during
the June proletarian uprising. Moderate republicans predominated on the
Commission; Ledru-Rollin was the sole representative of the Left. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n80"><span class="info">80.</span></a> Under
the decree prohibiting congregations of people adopted by the Constituent
Assembly on June 7, 1848, the organisation of gatherings and meetings in the
open was punishable by imprisonment of up to ten years. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n81"><span class="info">81.</span></a> On June
22, 1848, <i>Le Moniteur universel </i>No. 174 in the section
‘’Partie non officielle” reported an order of the Executive
Commission of June 21 on the expulsion of workers between the ages of 17 and 25
from the national workshops and their compulsory enrolment in the army. On July
3, 1848, after the suppression of the June insurrection of the Paris workers,
the government passed a decree dissolving the national workshops. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n83"><span class="info">83.</span></a> In the
German original, the term <i>Haupt- und Staatsaktion </i>(“principal
and spectacular action,” “main and state action”) is used,
which has a double meaning. First, in the seventeenth and the first half of the
eighteenth century, it denoted plays performed by German touring companies. The
plays were rather formless historical tragedies, bombastic and at the same time
coarse and farcical.</p>
<p class="information">Second, this term can denote major political events. It
was used in this sense by a trend in German historical science known as
“objective historiography.”</p>
<p class="information">Leopold Ranke was one of its chief representatives. He
regarded <i>Haupt- und Staatsaktion </i>as the main subject-matter. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n84"><span class="info">84.</span></a> The
reference is to the by-elections to the Constituent Assembly in Paris on
September 17, 1848 (to replace former deputies, including those who were
deprived of their powers after the June insurrection was suppressed). Among the
newly elected was the revolutionary socialist Francois Raspail, imprisoned
after the events of May 15, 1848. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n85"><span class="info">85.</span></a> This
refers to a system of general treaties set up by the Congress of Vienna
(September 1814-June 1815), embracing the whole of Europe, apart from Turkey.
The Congress decisions helped to restore feudal order, perpetuated the
political fragmentation of Germany and Italy, sanctioned the incorporation of
Belgium into Holland and the partition of Poland, and outlined measures to
combat the revolutionary movement. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n86"><span class="info">86.</span></a> The
<i>Projet de constitution présenté à l’Assemblée nationale </i>drafted
by the commission was submitted to the National Assembly by Marrast on June 19,
1848. The draft was published in <i>Le Moniteur universel </i>No. 172, June
20, 1848. A German translation of the draft was published in the supplement to
No. 24 of the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung </i>on June 24, 1848. After the June
insurrection, this draft was thoroughly revised by its authors in a
conservative spirit. The Constitution of the French Republic was finally
adopted on November 4, 1848. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n87"><span class="info">87.</span></a> The lily
– a heraldic emblem of the Bourbon dynasty; the violet – a
Bonapartist emblem. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n88"><span class="info">88.</span></a> By a
decree of the Senate (Senatus consult) of May 18, 1804, Napoleon I, the founder
of the Bonaparte dynasty, was proclaimed Emperor of the French.</p>
<p class="information">During the February uprising of 1848, King Louis
Philippe and the monarchist circles were compelled to make Guizot and other
unpopular ministers tender their resignations, and tried to form a government
of moderate liberals to save the monarchy. On the morning of February 24 Odilon
Barrot was authorised to head the Cabinet, but Louis Philippe was compelled to
abdicate and flee by the victory of the popular revolution. The Barrot Ministry
survived till that afternoon. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n89"><span class="info">89.</span></a> On
January 26, 1849, the Minister of Public Works Leon Faucher submitted and
demanded urgent discussion of a Bill on the right of association, prohibiting
clubs. The Constituent Assembly, however, refused to discuss the Bill as an
urgent matter. In spite of opposition from the Left deputies, who demanded the
Ministry’s resignation, accusing it of a breach of the Constitution, the
first clause of the Bill (better known as the Bill on Clubs) was adopted by the
National Assembly by a monarchist and moderate republican vote on March 21,
1849. This decision dealt a serious blow at the freedom of assembly and
association, primarily at the workers’ associations. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n90"><span class="info">90.</span></a> An
allusion to the similarity between the schemes for restoring the monarchy in
December 1848, when Changarnier assumed command of the National Guard and the
Paris garrison, and the part General Monk played in restoring the Stuarts in
1660. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n91"><span class="info">91.</span></a> In April
1849, President Louis Bonaparte and the French Government sent an expeditionary
corps to Italy under General Oudinot to intervene against the Roman Republic
proclaimed on February 9, 1849, and to restore the secular power of the Pope.
On April 30, 1849, the French troops were driven back from Rome. The main blow
was dealt by Garibaldi’s volunteer corps. Oudinot violated the terms of
the armistice signed by the French, however, and on June 3 started a new
offensive against the Roman Republic, which had just completed a military
campaign against Neapolitan troops in the south and was engaged in rebuffing
the Austrians in the north. After a month of heroic defence, Rome was captured
by the interventionists and the Roman Republic ceased to exist. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n92"><span class="info">92.</span></a> The
reference is to the defeat of the Piedmontese army during the second stage of
the Austro-Italian war which broke out on March 25, 1848, as a result of the
national liberation uprising in Lombardy and Venice against Austrian rule.
However, the Piedmontese were compelled by military setbacks, particularly the
defeat at Custozza on July 25 and 26, 1848, and the capture of Milan by the
Austrians, to conclude an onerous armistice with Austria on August 9, 1848. On
March 12, 1849, under public pressure, Charles Albert, King of Sardinia,
cancelled the armistice and on March 20 hostilities were resumed. Despite
national enthusiasm in Austrian-occupied Lombardy and throughout Italy, the
Piedmontese army was defeated at Novara on March 23. Charles Albert abdicated.
Victor Emmanuel II, the new King, concluded an armistice with the Austrians on
March 26, and on August 6 a peace treaty was signed restoring Austrian rule in
Northern Italy and the Austrian protectorate over a number of states of Central
Italy (Parma, Tuscany, etc.).</p>
<p class="information">Engels gives a detailed account of the Austro-Italian
war of 1848-49 in his articles in the <i>Neue Rheinische Zeitung</i>. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n93"><span class="info">93.</span></a> <i>Le
Comité de saint public</i> (the Committee of Public Safety) established by the
Convention on April 6, 1793; during the Jacobin dictatorship (June 2, 1793-July
27, 1794) it was the leading body of the revolutionary government in France. It
lasted until October 26, 1795. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n95"><span class="info">95.</span></a> General
Brea, who commanded some of the troops that suppressed the June insurrection of
the Paris proletariat, was killed by the insurgents at the gates of
Fontainebleau on June 25, 1848, for which two of the insurgents were executed.
</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n96"><span class="info">96.</span></a> The
reference is to the revolutionary events in Hungary and Germany in the spring
and summer of 1849. A counter-offensive by the Hungarian revolutionary army,
which routed the Austrian troops and almost cleared the Austrian invaders from
the whole country, began in April. Hungary declared its independence on April
14, the Habsburg dynasty was officially dethroned and Kossuth elected head of
state. However, a change unfavourable to the revolutionary movement shortly
took place in the Hungarian campaign. In mid-June 1849 the Tsarist army entered
Hungary to assist the Austrian counter-revolution. The Tsarist intervention was
in effect approved by the ruling circles of France and England. The combined
forces of the Habsburgs and the Tsar suppressed the Hungarian revolution.</p>
<p class="information">Almost simultaneously with the counter-offensive by the
Hungarians, popular uprisings broke out in Saxony, Rhenish Prussia, the
Palatinate and Baden in defence of the Imperial Constitution drafted by the
Frankfurt National Assembly but rejected by the King of Prussia and other
German princes. On the development of these uprisings see Engels’ essays
<i>The Campaign for the German Imperial Constitution</i>. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n97"><span class="info">97.</span></a> The
reference is to the bombardment of Rome by Oudinot’s expeditionary corps
on June 3, 1849. Rome was repeatedly subjected to fierce bombardments during
the French siege, which lasted until July 3, 1849. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n98"><span class="info">98.</span></a> Article
V belongs to the introductory part of the Constitution. The articles of the
principal part of the Constitution are numbered in Arabic figures. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n99"><span class="info">99.</span></a> The
meeting of the Montagne leaders was held on the premises of the
Fourierists’ daily <i>La Démocratie pacifique </i>on the evening of
June 12, 1849. (Using the expression <i>friedfertige </i>[pacific]
<i>Demokratie, </i>Marx plays on the title of the newspaper and its trend.)
The participants refused to resort to arms and decided to confine themselves to
a peaceful demonstration. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n100"><span class="info">100.</span></a> In the
manifesto published in <i>Le Peuple No. 206, </i>June 13, 1849, the
Democratic Association of the Friends of the Constitution – an
organisation of moderate bourgeois republicans formed by the <i>National
</i>party members during the Legislative Assembly election campaign –
called upon the citizens of Paris to participate in a peaceful demonstration to
protest against the “presumptuous pretensions” of the executive
authorities. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n101"><span class="info">101.</span></a> The
<i>Declaration of the Montagne </i>was published in <i>La Réforme </i>and
in <i>La Démocratie pacifique </i>and also in Proudhon’s newspaper
<i>Le Peuple</i> No. 206,<i></i>June 13, 1849. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n102"><span class="info">102.</span></a> The
events in Paris sparked off an armed uprising of Lyons workers and craftsmen on
June 15, 1849. The insurgents occupied the Croix-Rousse quarter and erected
barricades, but were suppressed by troops after several hours of staunch
struggle. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n103"><span class="info">103.</span></a> On
August 10, 1849, the Legislative Assembly adopted a law under which
“instigators and supporters of the conspiracy and the attempt of June
13” were liable to trial by the Supreme Court. Thirty-four deputies of
the Mountain (Ledru-Rollin, Felix Pyat and Victor Considerant among them) were
deprived of their mandates and put on trial (some of them, those who emigrated,
were tried by default). On June 13, the editorial offices of democratic and
socialist newspapers were raided and the main of these papers were banned.
Repressions were extended to emigrants residing in France, including Marx, who
was ordered to leave Paris for the department of Morbihan, a remote swampy area
in Brittany (on this see present edition, Vol. 9, p. 527). At the end of August
1849 Marx left France for England, not wishing to submit to the arbitrary
police decision. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n104"><span class="info">104.</span></a> The
reference is to the <i>Municipal Guard of Paris </i>formed after the July
1830 revolution and subordinated to the Prefect of Police. It was used to
suppress popular uprisings and was disbanded after the February 1848
revolution. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n105"><span class="info">105.</span></a> In the
battle of Waterloo<i></i>(June 18, 1815) Napoleon’s army was defeated
by British and Prussian troops commanded by Wellington and Blücher. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n106"><span class="info">106.</span></a> The
reference is to the commission of three cardinals (who traditionally wore
scarlet mantles) which, after the suppression of the Roman Republic by the
French army and relying on support from the interventionists, restored the
reactionary clerical regime in the papal states. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n108"><span class="info">108.</span></a>
Alongside Wiesbaden, Ems was a permanent residence of Count Chambord, the
Legitimist pretender to the French throne (who called himself Henry V). </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n109"><span class="info">109.</span></a> Louis
Philippe, who had fled from France after the February revolution of 1848, lived
in Claremont. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n110"><span class="info">110.</span></a>
“<i>Motu proprio</i>” (of his own motion) – initial words
of a special kind of papal encyclical adopted without the preliminary approval
of the cardinals and usually concerning the internal political and
administrative affairs of the papal states.</p>
<p class="information">Here this refers to the statement of Pope Pius IX
“To My Beloved Subjects” of September 12, 1849 (the French text was
published in <i>Le Moniteur universel </i>No. 271, September 28, 1849). </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n111"><span class="info">111.</span></a> The
proposition that the proletarian revolution could only be victorious in several
advanced capitalist countries simultaneously and not in a single country alone
was most clearly formulated by Engels in his work <i>Principles of Communism
</i>(1847) (see present edition, Vol. 6, pp. 351-52). By developing further
the Marxist theory and drawing on the law of uneven economic and political
development of capitalism in the era of imperialism, in 1915 Lenin came to the
conclusion that under the new historical conditions, the victory of the
socialist revolution would be possible initially in a few or even in a single
country. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n112"><span class="info">112.</span></a> The
figures do not tally: the text reads 538,000,000 instead of 578,178,000,
apparently a misprint. This does not, however, affect the general conclusion,
for the net per capita income is less than 25 francs in both cases. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n113"><span class="info">113.</span></a>
Lagarde, a supporter of the Mountain party, was elected to the Legislative
Assembly in the by-elections held in the department of the Gironde on October
14, 1849, to replace the deceased Right-wing deputy Ravez.</p>
<p class="information"><a id="n116"><span class="info">116.</span></a> in his
message of November 10, 1849, Carlier, the newly appointed Paris Police
Prefect, called for a “social anti-socialist league” to be set up
for the protection of “religion, labour, family, property and
loyalty.” The message was published in <i>Le Moniteur universel </i>No.
315, November 11, 1849. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n118"><span class="info">118.</span></a> The
<i>July column </i>erected in Paris on Bastille Square in 1840 in memory of
those who fell in the July revolution of 1830 has been decorated with wreaths
of immortelles ever since the February revolution of 1848. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n119"><span class="info">119.</span></a> May 4,
1848 – the Constituent Assembly was convened; December 20, 1848 –
Louis Bonaparte became President; May 13, 1849 – elections were held to
the Legislative Assembly; July 8, 1849 – by-elections took place in Paris
as a result of which the party of Order strengthened its position in the
Legislative Assembly. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n120"><span class="info">120.</span></a>
<i>Coblenz – </i>a city in Western Germany; it was the centre of
counter-revolutionary emigration during the French Revolution. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n121"><span class="info">121.</span></a> The
reference is to the discovery of gold in California in 1848. Along with the
discovery of rich deposits of gold in Australia in 1851, the Californian
discovery added to the industrial and stock-exchange agitation in capitalist
countries. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n122"><span class="info">122.</span></a>
Proudhon expressed this point of view in his polemics against the bourgeois
economist Frederic Bastiat, published in <i>La Voix du peuple </i>from
November 1849 to February 1850 and reproduced in a separate edition which
appeared in Paris in 1850 under the title <i>Gratuite du credit. Discussion
entre M. Fr. Bastiat et M. Proudhon. </i></p>
<p class="information"><a id="n123"><span class="info">123.</span></a> In
1797 the British Government issued a special Bank Restriction Act making
bank-notes legal tender and suspending the payment of gold for them.</p>
<p class="information">Convertibility was reintroduced only in 1821 in
conformity with a law passed in 1819. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n125"><span class="info">125.</span></a> The
reference is to the commission of 17 Orleanists and Legitimists - deputies to
the Legislative Assembly – appointed by the Minister of the Interior on
May 1, 1850, to draft a new electoral law. Its members were nicknamed
burgraves, a name borrowed from the title of Victor Hugo’s historical
drama as an allusion to their unwarranted claims to power and their reactionary
aspirations. The drama is set in medieval Germany where the <i>Burggraf
</i>was governor of a <i>Burg </i>(city) or a district, appointed by the
Emperor. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n127"><span class="info">127.</span></a>
<i>Baiser-Lamourette </i>(Lamourette’s kiss) – an allusion to an
incident during the French Revolution. On July 7, 1792, Lamourette, deputy to
the Legislative Assembly, proposed to end all party dissension with a fraternal
kiss, and the representatives of the hostile parties, in accordance with this
proposal, embraced one another. The following day, however, the struggle among
the parties flared up with fresh vigour. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n129"><span class="info">129.</span></a> The
reference is to a new ministry to be appointed if the Bourbon dynasty was
restored in the person of the Legitimist pretender to the throne, Count
Chambord. It was to consist of de Levis, de Saint-Priest, Berryer, de Pastoret
and d’Escars. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n130"><span class="info">130.</span></a> The
reference is to the so-called Wiesbaden Manifesto – a circular drawn up
in Wiesbaden on August 30, 1850, by de Barthélemy, secretary of the Legitimist
faction in the Legislative Assembly, on the instruction of Count Chambord (de
Barthélemy, <i>La conspiration légitimiste avouée, </i>in <i>Le Peuple de
1850 No. 24, </i>September <i>22, </i>1850). The circular was the
Legitimists’ policy statement in case they came to power. Count Chambord
declared that he “officially and categorically rejects any appeal to the
people, because it will signify a negation of the great national principle of
hereditary monarchy.” This statement evoked protests among the
Legitimists themselves, notably from a group headed by La Rochejaquelein, and
polemics in the press. </p>
<p class="information"><a id="n131"><span class="info">131.</span></a> An
allusion to the expiration of Louis Bonaparte’s presidential powers. In
the text the date is not exact. According to the Constitution of the French
Republic, presidential elections were to be held every four years on the second
Sunday in May, on which day the powers of the incumbent President expired<i>.
</i></p>
<p class="information"><a id="n132"><span class="info">132.</span></a> The
<i>Society of December 10</i> (<i>Dix Decembre</i>) – a Bonapartist
organisation founded in 1849 and consisting mainly of declassed elements,
political adventurists, the reactionary military. Many of its members helped to
elect Louis Bonaparte as President of the Republic on December 10, <i>1848,
</i>hence its name. This organisation played an active part in the Bonapartist
coup d’état on December 2, 1851. Marx describes the society in his
<i>The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte</i>. </p>

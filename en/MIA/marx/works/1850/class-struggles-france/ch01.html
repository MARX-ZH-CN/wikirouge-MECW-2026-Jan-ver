<p class="title">The Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850</p>
<h3>Part I<br>
The Defeat of June, 1848</h3>
<p class="fst">After the July Revolution <span class="context">[of
1830]</span>, when the liberal banker Laffitte led his <i>compère</i>, the Duke
of Orléans, in triumph to the Hôtel de Ville, he let fall the words:
“<i>From now on the bankers will rule</i>”. Laffitte had betrayed
the secret of the revolution.</p>
<p>It was not the French bourgeoisie that ruled under Louis Philippe, but one
<i>faction</i> of it: bankers, stock-exchange kings, railway kings, owners of
coal and iron mines and forests, a part of the landed proprietors associated
with them – the so-called <i>financial aristocracy</i>. It sat on the
throne, it dictated laws in the Chambers, it distributed public offices, from
cabinet portfolios to tobacco bureau posts.</p>
<p>The <i>industrial bourgeoisie</i> proper formed part of the official
opposition, that is, it was represented only as a minority in the Chambers. Its
opposition was expressed all the more resolutely the more unalloyed the
autocracy of the finance aristocracy became, and the more it imagined that its
domination over the working class was insured after the revolts of 1832, 1834,
and 1839, which had been drowned in blood.<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.html#n64" target=_blank>[64]</a></sup> <i>Grandin</i>, a Rouen manufacturer and
the most fanatical instrument of bourgeois reaction in the Constituent as well
as in the Legislative National Assembly, was the most violent opponent of
Guizot in the Chamber of Deputies. <i>Léon Faucher</i>, later known for his
impotent efforts to climb into prominence as the Guizot of the French
counterrevolution, in the last days of Louis Philippe waged a war of the pen
for industry against speculation and its train bearer, the government.
<i>Bastiat</i> agitated in the name of Bordeaux and the whole of
wine-producing France against the ruling system.</p>
<p>The <i>petty bourgeoisie</i> of all gradations, and the <i>peasantry</i>
also, were completely excluded from political power. Finally, in the official
opposition or entirely outside the <i>pays légal</i> [electorate], there were
the <i>ideological</i> representatives and spokesmen of the above classes,
their savants, lawyers, doctors, etc., in a word, their so-called <i>men of
talent</i>.</p>
<p>Owing to its financial straits, the July Monarchy was dependent from the
beginning on the big bourgeoisie, and its dependence on the big bourgeoisie was
the inexhaustible source of increasing financial straits. It was impossible to
subordinate the administration of the state to the interests of national
production without balancing the budget, without establishing a balance between
state expenditures and revenues. And how was this balance to be established
without limiting state expenditures – that is, without encroaching on
interests which were so many props of the ruling system – and without
redistributing taxes – that is, without shifting a considerable share of
the burden of taxation onto the shoulders of the big bourgeoisie itself?</p>
<p>On the contrary, the faction of the bourgeoisie that ruled and legislated
through the Chambers had a <i>direct interest</i> in the <i>indebtedness of
the state</i>. The <i>state deficit</i> was really the main object of its
speculation and the chief source of its enrichment. At the end of each year a
new deficit. After the lapse of four or five years a new loan. And every new
loan offered new opportunities to the finance aristocracy for defrauding the
state, which was kept artificially on the verge of bankruptcy – it had to
negotiate with the bankers under the most unfavorable conditions. Each new loan
gave a further opportunity, that of plundering the public which invested its
capital in state bonds by means of stock-exchange manipulations, the secrets of
which the government and the majority in the Chambers were privy to. In
general, the instability of state credit and the possession of state secrets
gave the bankers and their associates in the Chambers and on the throne the
possibility of evoking sudden, extraordinary fluctuations in the quotations of
government securities, the result of which was always bound to be the ruin of a
mass of smaller capitalists and the fabulously rapid enrichment of the big
gamblers. As the state deficit was in the direct interest of the ruling faction
of the bourgeoisie, it is clear why the extraordinary state expenditure in the
last years of Louis Philippe's reign was far more than double the
<i>extraordinary</i> state expenditure under Napoleon, indeed reached a
yearly sum of nearly 400,000,000 francs, whereas the whole average annual
export of France seldom attained a volume amounting to 750,000,000 francs. The
enormous sums which in this way flowed through the hands of the state
facilitated, moreover, swindling contracts for deliveries, bribery,
defalcations, and all kinds of roguery.</p>
<p>The defrauding of the state, practiced wholesale in connection with loans,
was repeated retail in public works. What occurred in the relations between
Chamber and government became multiplied in the relations between individual
departments and individual entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The ruling class exploited the <i>building of railways</i> in the same way
it exploited state expenditures in general and state loans. The Chambers piled
the main burdens on the state, and secured the golden fruits to the speculating
finance aristocracy. One recalls the scandals in the Chamber of Deputies when
by chance it leaked out that all the members of the majority, including a
number of ministers, had been interested as shareholders in the very railway
constructions which as legislators they had carried out afterward at the cost
of the state.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the smallest financial reform was wrecked through the
influence of the bankers. For example, the <i>postal reform</i>. Rothschild
protested. Was it permissible for the state to curtail sources of revenue out
of which interest was to be paid on its ever increasing debt?</p>
<p>The July Monarchy was nothing other than a joint stock company for the
exploitation of France's national wealth, whose dividends were divided among
ministers, Chambers, 240,000 voters, and their adherents. Louis Philippe was
the director of this company – Robert Macaire<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.html#n65" target=_blank>[65]</a></sup> on the throne. Trade, industry,
agriculture, shipping, the interests of the industrial bourgeoisie, were bound
to be continually endangered and prejudiced under this system. Cheap
government, <i>governement à bon marché</i>, was what it had inscribed on its
banner in the July days.</p>
<p>Since the finance aristocracy made the laws, was at the head of the
administration of the state, had command of all the organized public
authorities, dominated public opinion through the actual state of affairs and
through the press, the same prostitution, the same shameless cheating, the same
mania to get rich was repeated in every sphere, from the court to the Café
Borgne<a href="#n2"><sup class="enote">[2]</sup></a> to get rich not by
production, but by pocketing the already available wealth of others, Clashing
every moment with the bourgeois laws themselves, an unbridled assertion of
unhealthy and dissolute appetites manifested itself, particularly at the top of
bourgeois society – lusts wherein wealth derived from gambling naturally
seeks its satisfaction, where pleasure becomes <i>crapuleux</i> <span class="context">[debauched]</span>, where money, filth, and blood commingle.
The finance aristocracy, in its mode of acquisition as well as in its
pleasures, is nothing but the <i>rebirth of the lumpenproletariat on the
heights of bourgeois society</i>.</p>
<p>And the nonruling factions of the French bourgeoisie cried:
<i>Corruption!</i> The people cried: <i>À bas les grands voleurs! À bas les
assassins</i>! <span class="context">[Down with the big thieves! Down with the
assassins!]</span> when in 1847, on the most prominent stages of bourgeois
society, the same scenes were publicly enacted that regularly lead the
<i>lumpenproletariat</i> to brothels, to workhouses and lunatic asylums, to the
bar of justice, to the dungeon, and to the scaffold. The industrial bourgeoisie
saw its interests endangered, the petty bourgeoisie was filled with moral
indignation, the imagination of the people was offended, Paris was flooded with
pamphlets – “The Rothschild Dynasty,” “Usurers Kings of
the Epoch,” etc. – in which the rule of the finance aristocracy was
denounced and stigmatized with greater or less wit.</p>
<p><i>Rien pour la gloire</i>! <span class="context">[Nothing for
glory!]</span> Glory brings no profit! <i>La paix partout et toujours</i>!
<span class="context">[Peace everywhere and always!]</span> War depresses the
quotations of the 3 and 4 percents which the France of the Bourse jobbers had
inscribed on her banner. Her foreign policy was therefore lost in a series of
mortifications to French national sentiment, which reacted all the more
vigorously when the rape of Poland was brought to its conclusion with the
incorporation of Cracow by Austria, and when Guizot came out actively on the
side of the Holy Alliance in the Swiss separatist war.<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.html#n66" target=_blank>[66]</a></sup> The victory of the Swiss liberals in this
mimic war raised the self-respect of the bourgeois opposition in France; the
bloody uprising of the people in Palermo worked like an electric shock on the
paralyzed masses of the people and awoke their great revolutionary memories and
passions. <span class="context">[Annexation of Cracow by Austria in agreement
with Russia and Prussia on November 11, 1846. – Swiss Sonderbund war:
November 4 to 28, 1847. – Rising in Palermo: January 12, 1848; at the end
of January, nine days’ bombardment of the town by the Neapolitans. Note

<p>The eruption of the general discontent was finally accelerated and the mood
for revolt ripened by <i>two economic world events.</i></p>
<p>The <i>potato blight</i> and the <i>crop failures</i> of 1845 and 1846
increased the general ferment among the people. The famine of 1847 called forth
bloody conflicts in France as well as on the rest of the Continent. As against
the shameless orgies of the finance aristocracy, the struggle of the people for
the prime necessities of life! At Buzançais, hunger rioters executed<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.html#n67" target=_blank>[67]</a></sup>; in Paris, oversatiated
<i>escrocs</i> [swindlers] snatched from the courts by the royal family!</p>
<p>The second great economic event that hastened the outbreak of the revolution
was a <i>general commercial and industrial crisis</i> in England. Already
heralded in the autumn of 1845 by the wholesale reverses of the speculators in
railway shares, staved off during 1846 by a number of incidents such as the
impending abolition of the Corn Laws, the crisis finally burst in the autumn of
1847 with the bankruptcy of the London wholesale grocers, on the heels of which
followed the insolvencies of the land banks and the closing of the factories in
the English industrial districts. The after-effect of this crisis on the
Continent had not yet spent itself when the February Revolution broke out.</p>
<p>The devastation of trade and industry caused by the economic epidemic made
the autocracy of the finance aristocracy still more unbearable. Throughout the
whole of France the bourgeois opposition <i>agitated at banquets</i> for an
<i>electoral reform</i> which should win for it the majority in the Chambers
and overthrow the Ministry of the Bourse. In Paris the industrial crisis had,
moreover, the particular result of throwing a multitude of manufacturers and
big traders, who under the existing circumstances could no longer do any
business in the foreign market, onto the home market. They set up large
establishments, the competition of which ruined the small <i>épiciers</i> <span class="context">[grocers]</span> and <i>boutiquiers</i> <span class="context">[shopkeepers]</span> <i>en masse</i>. Hence the innumerable
bankruptcies among this section of the Paris bourgeoisie, and hence their
revolutionary action in February. It is well known how Guizot and the Chambers
answered the reform proposals with an unambiguous challenge, how Louis Philippe
too late resolved on a ministry led by Barrot, how things went as far as
hand-to-hand fighting between the people and the army, how the army was
disarmed by the passive conduct of the National Guard, how the July Monarchy
had to give way to a provisional government.</p>
<p>The <i>Provisional Government</i> which emerged from the February
barricades necessarily mirrored in its composition the different parties which
shared in the victory. It could not be anything but a <i>compromise between
the different classes</i> which together had overturned the July throne, but
whose interests were mutually antagonistic. The <i>great majority</i> of its
members consisted of representatives of the bourgeoisie. The republican petty
bourgeoisie was represented by Ledru-Rollin and Flocon, the republican
bourgeoisie by the people from the National<a href="#n3"><sup class="enote">[3]</sup></a>, the dynastic opposition by Crémieux, Dupont de
l'Eure, etc.<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.html#n68" target=_blank>[68]</a></sup> The
working class had only two representatives, Louis Blanc and Albert. Finally,
Lamartine in the Provisional Government; this was at first no real interest, no
definite class; this was the February Revolution itself, the common uprising
with its illusions, its poetry, its visionary content, and its phrases. For the
rest, the spokesman of the February Revolution, by his position and his views,
belonged to the <i>bourgeoisie</i>.</p>
<p>If Paris, as a result of political centralization, rules France, the
workers, in moments of revolutionary earthquakes, rule Paris. The first act in
the life of the Provisional Government was an attempt to escape from this
overpowering influence by an appeal from intoxicated Paris to sober France.
Lamartine disputed the right of the barricade fighters to proclaim a republic
on the ground that only the majority of Frenchmen had that right; they must
await their votes, the Paris proletariat must not besmirch its victory by a
usurpation. <span class="context">[From Lamartine's speech of 24
February]</span> The bourgeoisie allows the proletariat only <i>one</i>
usurpation – that of fighting.</p>
<p>Up to noon of February 25 the republic had not yet been proclaimed; on the
other hand, all the ministries had already been divided among the bourgeois
elements of the Provisional Government and among the generals, bankers, and
lawyers of the National. But the workers were determined this time not to put
up with any bamboozlement like that of July, 1830. They were ready to take up
the fight anew and to get a republic by force of arms. With this message,
<i>Raspail</i> betook himself to the <i>Hôtel de Ville</i>. In the name of
the Paris proletariat he <i>commanded</i> the Provisional Government to
proclaim a republic; if this order of the people were not fulfilled within two
hours, he would return at the head of 200,000 men. The bodies of the fallen
were scarcely cold, the barricades were not yet disarmed, and the only force
that could be opposed to them was the National Guard. Under these circumstances
the doubts born of considerations of state policy and the juristic scruples of
conscience entertained by the Provisional Government suddenly vanished. The
time limit of two hours had not yet expired when all the walls of Paris were
resplendent with the gigantic historical words:</p>
<p><i>République français! Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité!</i></p>
<p>Even the memory of the limited alms and motives which drove the bourgeoisie
into the February Revolution was extinguished by the proclamation of the
republic on the basis of universal suffrage. Instead of only a few factions of
the bourgeoisie, all classes of French society were suddenly hurled into the
orbit of political power, forced to leave the boxes, the stalls, and the
gallery and to act in person upon the revolutionary stage! With the
constitutional monarchy vanished also the semblance of a state power
independently confronting bourgeois society, as well as the whole series of
subordinate struggles which this semblance of power called forth!</p>
<p>By dictating the republic to the Provisional Government, and through the
Provisional Government to the whole of France, the proletariat immediately
stepped into the foreground as an independent party, but at the same time
challenged the whole of bourgeois France to enter the lists against it. What it
won was the terrain for the fight for its revolutionary emancipation, but by no
means this emancipation itself.</p>
<p>The first thing the February Republic had to do was, rather, to <i>complete
the rule of the bourgeoisie</i> by allowing, besides the finance aristocracy,
<i>all the propertied classes</i> to enter the orbit of political power. The
majority of the great landowners, the Legitimists, were emancipated from the
political nullity to which they had been condemned by the July Monarchy. Not
for nothing had the <i>Gazette de France</i> agitated in common with the
opposition papers; not for nothing had La Roche-Jaquelein taken the side of the
revolution in the session of the Chamber of Deputies on February 24. The
nominal proprietors, the <i>peasants</i>, who form the great majority of the
French people, were put by universal suffrage in the position of arbiters of
the fate of France. The February Republic finally brought the rule of the
bourgeoisie clearly into view, since it struck off the crown behind which
capital had kept itself concealed.</p>
<p>Just as the workers in the July days had fought for and won the
<i>bourgeois monarchy</i>, so in the February days they fought for and won
the <i>bourgeois republic</i>. Just as the July Monarchy had to proclaim
itself a <i>monarchy surrounded by republican institutions</i>, so the
February Republic was forced to proclaim itself a <i>republic surrounded by
social institutions</i>. The Paris proletariat <i>compelled</i> this
concession, too.</p>
<p>Marche, a worker, dictated the decree <span class="context">[decree on the
right to work, 25 February 1848]</span> by which the newly formed Provisional
Government pledged itself to guarantee the workers a livelihood by means of
labor, to provide work for all citizens, etc. And when a few days later it
forgot its promises and seemed to have lost sight of the proletariat, a mass of
20,000 workers marched on the <i>Hôtel de Ville</i> with the cry: <i>Organize
labor! Form a special Ministry of labor!</i> Reluctantly and after long
debate, the Provisional Government nominated a permanent special commission
charged with lending means of improving the lot of the working classes! This
commission consisted of delegates from the corporations [guilds] of Paris
artisans and was presided over by Louis Blanc and Albert. The Luxembourg Palace
was assigned to it as its meeting place. In this way the representatives of the
working class were banished from the seat of the Provisional Government, the
bourgeois part of which retained the real state power and the reins of
administration exclusively in its hands; and <i>side by side</i> with the
ministries of finance, trade, and public works, side by side with the Bank and
the Bourse, there arose a <i>socialist synagogue</i> whose high priests,
Louis Blanc and Albert, had the task of discovering the promised land, of
preaching the new gospel, and of providing work for the Paris proletariat.
Unlike any profane state power, they had no budget, no executive authority at
their disposal. They were supposed to break the pillars of bourgeois society by
dashing their heads against them. While the Luxembourg sought the philosopher's
stone, in the <i>Hôtel de Ville</i> they minted the current coinage.</p>
<p>And yet the claims of the Paris proletariat, so far as they went beyond the
bourgeois republic, could win no other existence than the nebulous one of the
Luxembourg.</p>
<p>In common with the bourgeoisie the workers had made the February Revolution,
and alongside the bourgeoisie they sought to secure the advancement of their
interests, just as they had installed a worker in the Provisional Government
itself alongside the bourgeois majority. Organize labor! But wage labor, that
is the existing, the bourgeois organization of labor. Without it there is no
capital, no bourgeoisie, no bourgeois society. A special Ministry of Labor! But
the ministries of finance, of trade, of public works – are not these the
bourgeois ministries of labor? And alongside these a proletariat Ministry of
Labor had to be a ministry of impotence, a ministry of pious wishes, a
Luxembourg Commission. Just as the workers thought they would be able to
emancipate themselves side by side with the bourgeoisie, so they thought they
would be able to consummate a proletarian revolution within the national walls
of France, side by side with the remaining bourgeois nations. But French
relations of production are conditioned by the foreign trade of France, by her
position on the world market and the laws thereof; how was France to break them
without a European revolutionary war, which would strike back at the despot of
the world market, England?</p>
<p>As soon as it has risen up, a class in which the revolutionary interests of
society are concentrated finds the content and the material for its
revolutionary activity directly in its own situation: foes to be laid low,
measures dictated by the needs of the struggle to be taken; the consequences of
its own deeds drive it on. It makes no theoretical inquiries into its own task.
The French working class had not attained this level; it was still incapable of
accomplishing its own revolution.</p>
<p>The development of the industrial proletariat is, in general, conditioned by
the development of the industrial bourgeoisie. Only under its rule does the
proletariat gain that extensive national existence which can raise its
revolution to a national one, and only thus does the proletariat itself create
the modern means of production, which become just so many means of its
revolutionary emancipation. Only bourgeois rule tears up the material roots of
feudal society and levels the ground on which alone a proletarian revolution is
possible. French industry is more developed and the French bourgeoisie more
revolutionary than that of the rest of the Continent. But was not the February
Revolution aimed directly against the finance aristocracy? This fact proved
that the industrial bourgeoisie did not rule France. The industrial bourgeoisie
can rule only where modern industry shapes all property relations to suit
itself, and industry can win this power only where it has conquered the world
market, for national bounds are inadequate for its development. But French
industry, to a great extent, maintains its command even of the national market
only through a more or less modified system of prohibitive duties. While,
therefore, the French proletariat, at the moment of a revolution, possesses in
Paris actual power and influence which spur it on to a drive beyond its means,
in the rest of France it is crowded into separate, scattered industrial
centers, almost lost in the superior number of peasants and petty bourgeois.
The struggle against capital in its developed, modern form – in its
decisive aspect, the struggle of the industrial wage worker against the
industrial bourgeois – is in France a partial phenomenon, which after the
February days could so much the less supply the national content of the
revolution, since the struggle against capital's secondary modes of
exploitation, that of the peasant against usury and mortgages or of the petty
bourgeois against the wholesale dealer, banker, and manufacturer – in a
word, against bankruptcy – was still hidden in the general uprising
against the finance aristocracy. Nothing is more understandable, then, than
that the Paris proletariat sought to secure the advancement of its own
interests side by side with those of the bourgeoisie, instead of enforcing them
as the revolutionary interests of society itself, that it let the red flag be
lowered to the <i>tricolor</i><sup class="enote"><a href="notes.html#n70" target=_blank>[70]</a></sup>. The French workers could not take a step
forward, could not touch a hair of the bourgeois order, until the course of the
revolution had aroused the mass of the nation, peasants and petite bourgeois,
standing between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, against this order,
against the rule of capital, and had forced it to attach itself to the
proletarians as its protagonists. The workers could buy this victory only
through the tremendous defeat in June.</p>
<p>The Luxembourg Commission, this creation of the Paris workers, must be given
the credit of having disclosed, from a Europe-wide tribune, the secret of the
revolution of the nineteenth century: <i>the emancipation of the
proletariat</i>. The <i>Moniteur</i> blushed when it had to propagate
officially the “wild ravings”<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.html#n71" target=_blank>[71]</a></sup> which up to that time had lain buried in
the apocryphal writings of the socialists and reached the ear of the
bourgeoisie only from time to time as remote, half-terrifying, half-ludicrous
legends. Europe awoke astonished from its bourgeois doze. Therefore, in the
minds of the proletarians, who confused the finance aristocracy with the
bourgeoisie in general; in the imagination of the good old republicans who
denied the very existence of classes or, at most, admitted them as a result of
the constitutional monarchy; in the hypocritical phrases of the factions of the
bourgeoisie which up to now had been excluded from power, the <i>rule of the
bourgeoisie</i> was abolished with the introduction of the republic. At that
time all the royalists were transformed into republicans and all the
millionaires of Paris into workers. The phrase which corresponded to this
imaginary abolition of class relations was <i>fraternité</i>, universal
fraternization and brotherhood. This pleasant abstraction from class
antagonisms, this sentimental reconciliation of contradictory class interests,
this visionary elevation above the class struggle, this fraternite, was the
real catchword of the February Revolution. The classes were divided by a mere
misunderstanding, and on February 24 Lamartine christened the Provisional
Government “une gouvernement qui suspends <i>ce malentendu terrible qui
existe entre les différentes classes</i>” <span class="context">[a
government that removes this terrible misunderstanding which exists between the
different classes, from Lamartine's speech, 24 February 1848]</span>. The Paris
proletariat reveled in this magnanimous intoxication of fraternity.</p>
<p>The Provisional Government, for its part, once it was compelled to proclaim
the republic, did everything to make it acceptable to the bourgeoisie and to
the provinces. The bloody terror of the first French republic was disavowed by
the abolition of the death penalty for political offenses; the press was opened
to all opinions – the army, the courts, the administration remained with
a few exceptions in the hands of their old dignitaries; none of the July
Monarchy's great offenders was brought to book. The bourgeois republicans of
the National amused themselves by exchanging monarchist names and costumes for
old republican ones. To them the republic was only a new ball dress for the old
bourgeois society. The young republic sought its chief merit not in
frightening, but rather in constantly taking fright itself, and in winning
existence and disarming resistance by soft compliance and nonresistance. At
home to the privileged classes, abroad to the despotic powers, it was loudly
announced that the republic was of a peaceful nature. Live and let live was its
professed motto. In addition to that, shortly after the February Revolution the
Germans, Poles, Austrians, Hungarians, and Italians revolted, each people in
accordance with its immediate situation. Russia and England – the latter
itself agitated, the former cowed – were not prepared. The republic,
therefore, had no national enemy to face. Consequently there were no great
foreign complications which could fire the energies, hasten the revolutionary
process, drive the Provisional Government forward or throw it overboard. The
Paris proletariat, which looked upon the republic as its own creation,
naturally acclaimed each act of the Provisional Government which facilitated
the firm emplacement of the latter in bourgeois society. It willingly allowed
itself to be employed on police service by Caussidière in order to protect
property in Paris, just as it allowed Louis Blanc to arbitrate wage disputes
between workers and masters. It made it a <i>point d'honneur</i> <span class="context">[point of honor]</span> to preserve the bourgeois honor of the
republic unblemished in the eyes of Europe.</p>
<p>The republic encountered no resistance either abroad or at home. This
disarmed it. Its task was no longer the revolutionary transformation of the
world, but consisted only in adapting itself to the relations of bourgeois
society. As to the fanaticism with which the Provisional Government undertook
this task there is no more eloquent testimony than its <i>financial
measures</i>.</p>
<p><i>Public credit</i> and <i>private credit</i> were naturally shaken.
<i>Public credit</i> rests on confidence that the state will allow itself to
be exploited by the wolves of finance. But the old state had vanished and the
revolution was directed above all against the finance aristocracy. The
vibrations of the last European commercial crisis had not yet ceased.
Bankruptcy still followed bankruptcy.</p>
<p><i>Private credit</i> was therefore paralyzed, circulation restricted,
production at a standstill before the February Revolution broke out. The
revolutionary crisis increased the commercial crisis. And if private credit
rests on confidence that bourgeois production in the entire scope of its
relations – the bourgeois order – will not be touched, will remain
inviolate, what effect must a revolution have had which questioned the basis of
bourgeois production, the economic slavery of the proletariat, which set up
against the Bourse the sphinx of the Luxembourg? The uprising of the
proletariat is the abolition of bourgeois credit, for it is the abolition of
bourgeois production and its order. Public credit and private credit are the
economic thermometer by which the intensity of a revolution can be measured.
<i>The more they fall, the more the fervor and generative power of the
revolution rises.</i></p>
<p>The Provisional Government wanted to strip the republic of its antibourgeois
appearance. And so it had, above all, to try to peg the exchange value of this
new form of state, its <i>quotation</i> on the Bourse. Private credit
necessarily rose again, together with the current Bourse quotation of the
republic.</p>
<p>In order to allay the very <i>suspicion</i> that it would not or could not
honor the obligations assumed by the monarchy, in order to build up confidence
in the republic's bourgeois morality and capacity to pay, the Provisional
Government took refuge in braggadocio as undignified as it was childish. In
advance of the legal date of payment it paid out the interest on the 5-percent,
4 ½-percent and 4-percent bonds to the state creditors. The bourgeois aplomb,
the self-assurance of the capitalists, suddenly awoke when they saw the anxious
haste with which this government sought to buy their confidence.</p>
<p>The financial embarrassment of the Provisional Government was naturally not
lessened by a theatrical stroke which robbed it of its stock of ready cash. The
financial pinch could no longer be concealed and <i>petty bourgeois</i>,
<i>domestic servants</i>, and <i>workers</i> had to pay for the pleasant
surprise which had been prepared for the state creditors.</p>
<p>It was announced that no more money could be drawn on <i>savings bank
books</i> for an amount of over a hundred francs. The sums deposited in the
savings banks were confiscated and by decree transformed into an irredeemable
state debt. This embittered the already hard-pressed <i>petty bourgeois</i>
against the republic. Since he received state debt certificates in place of his
savings bank books, he was forced to go to the Bourse in order to sell them and
thus deliver himself directly into the hands of the Bourse jobbers against whom
he had made the February Revolution.</p>
<p>The finance aristocracy, which ruled under the July Monarchy, had its high
church in the <i>Bank</i>. Just as the Bourse governs state credit, the Bank
governs <i>commercial credit</i>.</p>
<p>Directly threatened not only in its rule but in its very existence by the
February Revolution, the Bank tried from the outset to discredit the republic
by making the lack of credit general. It suddenly stopped the credits of the
bankers, the manufacturers, and the merchants. As it did not immediately call
forth a counterrevolution, this maneuver necessarily reacted on the Bank
itself. The capitalists drew out the money they had deposited in the vaults of
the Bank. The possessors of bank notes rushed to the pay office in order to
exchange them for gold and silver.</p>
<p>The Provisional Government could have forced the Bank into
<i>bankruptcy</i> without forcible interference, in a legal manner; it would
have had only to remain passive and leave the Bank to its fate. The
<i>bankruptcy</i> of the Bank would have been the deluge which in an instant
would have swept from French soil the finance aristocracy, the most powerful
and dangerous enemy of the republic, the golden pedestal of the July Monarchy.
And once the Bank was bankrupt, the bourgeoisie itself would have had to regard
it as a last desperate attempt at rescue, if the government had formed a
national bank and subjected national credit to the control of the nation.</p>
<p>The Provisional Government, on the contrary, fixed a <i>compulsory
quotation</i> for the notes of the Bank. It did more. It transformed all
provincial banks into branches of the Banque de France and allowed it to cast
its net over the whole of France. Later it pledged the <i>state forests</i>
to the Bank as a guarantee for a loan contracted from it. In this way the
February Revolution directly strengthened and enlarged the bankocracy which it
should have overthrown.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Provisional Government was writhing under the incubus of a
growing deficit. In vain it begged for patriotic sacrifices. Only the workers
threw it their alms. Recourse had to be had to a heroic measure, to the
imposition of a <i>new tax</i>. But who was to be taxed? The Bourse wolves,
the bank kings, the state creditors, the rentiers, the industrialists? That was
not the way to ingratiate the republic with the bourgeoisie. That would have
meant, on the one hand, to endanger state credit and commercial credit, while
on the other, attempts were made to purchase them with such great sacrifices
and humiliations. But someone had to fork over the cash. Who was sacrificed to
bourgeois credit? <i>Jacques le bonhomme</i>, the <i>peasant</i>.</p>
<p>The Provisional Government imposed an additional tax of 45 centimes to the
franc on the four direct taxes. The government press cajoled the Paris
proletariat into believing that this tax would fall chiefly on the big landed
proprietors, on the possessors of the milliard granted by the Restoration.<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.html#n72" target=_blank>[72]</a></sup> But in truth it hit the
<i>peasant class</i> above all, that is, the large majority of the French
people. <i>They had to pay the costs of the February Revolution</i>; in them
the counterrevolution gained its main material. The 45-centime tax was a
question of life and death for the French peasant. He made it a life and death
question for the republic. From that moment the <i>republic</i> meant to the
French peasant the <i>45 centime tax</i>, and he saw in the Paris proletariat
the spendthrift who did himself well at his expense.</p>
<p>Whereas the Revolution of 1789 began by shaking the feudal burdens off the
peasants, the Revolution of 1848 announced itself to the rural population by
the imposition of a new tax, in order not to endanger capital and to keep its
state machine going.</p>
<p>There was only one means by which the Provisional Government could set aside
all these inconveniences and jerk the state out of its old rut – a
<i>declaration of state bankruptcy</i>. Everyone recalls how Ledru-Rollin in
the National Assembly subsequently described the virtuous indignation with
which he repudiated this presumptuous proposal of the Bourse Jew, Fould <span class="context">[from Ledru-Rollin's speech 21 April 1849]</span>, now French
Finance Minister. Fould had handed him the apple from the tree of knowledge.</p>
<p>By honoring the bills drawn on the state by the old bourgeois society, the
Provisional Government succumbed to the latter. It had become the hard-pressed
debtor of bourgeois society instead of confronting it as the pressing creditor
that had to collect the revolutionary debts of many years. It had to
consolidate the shaky bourgeois relationships in order to fulfill obligations
which are only to be fulfilled within these relationships. Credit became a
condition of life for it, and the concessions to the proletariat, the promises
made to it, became so many <i>fetters</i> which <i>had</i> to be struck
off. The emancipation of the workers – even as a <i>phrase</i> –
became an unbearable danger to the new republic, for it was a standing protest
against the restoration of credit, which rests on undisturbed and untroubled
recognition of the existing economic class relations. Therefore, it was
necessary to <i>have done with the workers</i>.</p>
<p>The February Revolution had cast the army out of Paris. The National Guard,
that is, the bourgeoisie in its different gradations, constituted the sole
power. Alone, however, it did not feel itself a match for the proletariat.
Moreover, it was forced gradually and piecemeal to open its ranks and admit
armed proletarians, albeit after the most tenacious resistance and after
setting up a hundred different obstacles. There consequently remained but one
way out: <i>to play off part of the proletariat against the other</i>.</p>
<p>For this purpose the Provisional Government formed twenty–four
battalions of <i>Mobile Guards</i>, each a thousand strong, composed of young
men from fifteen to twenty years old.<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.html#n73" target=_blank>[73]</a></sup> They belonged for the most part to the
<i>lumpen proletariat</i>, which in all big towns forms a mass sharply
differentiated from the industrial proletariat, a recruiting ground for thieves
and criminals of all kinds living on the crumbs of society, people without a
definite trade, vagabonds, <i>gens sans feu et sans aveu</i> <span class="context">[men without hearth or home]</span>, varying according to the
degree of civilization of the nation to which they belong, but never renouncing
their <i>lazzaroni</i><sup class="enote"><a href="notes.html#n74" target=_blank>[74]</a></sup>
character – at the youthful age at which the Provisional Government
recruited them, thoroughly malleable, as capable of the most heroic deeds and
the most exalted sacrifices as of the basest banditry and the foulest
corruption. The Provisional Government paid them 1 franc 50 centimes a day;
that is, it bought them. It gave them their own uniform; that is, it made them
outwardly distinct from the blouse-wearing workers. In part it assigned
officers from the standing army as their leaders; in part they themselves
elected young sons of the bourgeoisie whose rodomontades about death for the
fatherland and devotion to the republic captivated them.</p>
<p>And so the Paris proletariat was confronted with an army, drawn from its own
midst, of 24,000 young, strong, foolhardy men. it gave cheers for the Mobile
Guard on its marches through Paris. It acknowledged it to be its foremost
fighters on the barricades. It regarded it as the <i>proletarian</i> guard in
contradistinction to the bourgeois National Guard. Its error was pardonable.</p>
<p>Besides the Mobile Guard, the government decided to rally around itself an
army of industrial workers. A hundred thousand workers, thrown on the streets
by the crisis and the revolution, were enrolled by the Minister Marie in
so-called national <i>ateliers</i> <span class="context">[workshops]</span>.
Under this grandiose name was hidden nothing else than the employment of the
workers on tedious, monotonous, unproductive earthworks at a wage of 23 sous.
<i>English workhouses</i><sup class="enote"><a href="notes.html#n75" target=_blank>[75]</a></sup> <i>in the open</i> – that is what
these national <i>ateliers</i> were. The Provisional Government believed that
it had formed, in them, a <i>second proletarian army against the workers
themselves</i>. This time the bourgeoisie was mistaken in the national
<i>ateliers</i>, just as the workers were mistaken in the Mobile Guard. It had
created an <i>army for mutiny</i>.</p>
<p>But one purpose was achieved.</p>
<p><i>National ateliers</i> was the name of the people's workshops which
Louis Blanc preached in the Luxembourg Palace. Marie's <i>ateliers</i> <span class="context">[workshops]</span>, devised in direct <i>antagonism</i> to
the Luxembourg, offered occasion, thanks to the common label, for a comedy of
errors worthy of the Spanish servant farce. The Provisional Government itself
surreptitiously spread the report that these national ateliers were the
discovery of Louis Blanc, and this seemed the more plausible because Louis
Blanc, the prophet of the national ateliers, was a member of the Provisional
Government. And in the half-naive, half-intentional confusion of the Paris
bourgeoisie, in the artificially molded opinion of France, of Europe, these
workhouses were the first realization of socialism, which was put in the
pillory, with them.</p>
<p>In their appellation, though not in their content, the <i>national
ateliers</i> were the embodied protest of the proletariat against bourgeois
industry, bourgeois credit, and the bourgeois republic. The whole hate of the
bourgeoisie was therefore turned upon them. It had found in them,
simultaneously, the point against which it could direct the attack, as soon as
it was strong enough to break openly with the February illusions. All the
discontent, all the ill humor of the <i>petty bourgeois</i> too was directed
against these national <i>ateliers</i>, the common target. With real fury they
totted up the money the proletarian loafers swallowed up while their own
situation was becoming daily more unbearable. A state pension for sham labor,
so that's socialism! they grumbled to themselves. They sought the reason for
their misery in the national ateliers, the declamations of the Luxembourg, the
processions of the workers through Paris. And no one was more fanatic about the
alleged machinations of the communists than the petty bourgeoisie, who hovered
hopelessly on the brink of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Thus in the approaching melee between bourgeoisie and proletariat, all the
advantages, all the decisive posts, all the middle strata of society were in
the hands of the bourgeoisie, at the same time as the waves of the February
Revolution rose high over the whole Continent, and each new post brought a new
bulletin of revolution, now from Italy, now from Germany, now from the remotest
parts of southeastern Europe, and maintained the general ecstasy of the people,
giving it constant testimony of a victory that it had already forfeited.</p>
<p><i>March 17</i> and <i>April 16</i> were the first skirmishes in the big
class struggle which the bourgeois republic hid under its wing.</p>
<p><i>March 17</i> revealed the proletariat's ambiguous situation, which
permitted no decisive act. Its demonstration originally pursued the purpose of
pushing the Provisional Government back onto the path of revolution, of
effecting the exclusion of its bourgeois members, according to circumstances,
and of compelling the postponement of the elections for the National Assembly
and the National Guard.<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.html#n76" target=_blank>[76]</a></sup> But on March 16 the bourgeoisie represented
in the National Guard staged a hostile demonstration against the Provisional
Government. With the cry <i>À bas Ledru-Rollin</i> <span class="context">[Down
with Ledru-Rollin]</span>! it surged to the <i>Hôtel de Ville</i>. And the
people were forced, on March 17, to shout: Long live Ledru-Rollin! Long live
the Provisional Government! They were forced to take sides against the
bourgeoisie in support of the bourgeois republic, which seemed to them to be in
danger. They strengthened the Provisional Government, instead of subordinating
it to themselves. March 17 went off in a melodramatic scene, and whereas the
Paris proletariat on this day once more displayed its giant body, the
bourgeoisie both inside and outside the Provisional Government was all the more
determined to smash it.</p>
<p><i>April 16</i> was a <i>misunderstanding</i> engineered by the
Provisional Government in alliance with the bourgeoisie. The workers had
gathered in great numbers in the Champ de Mars and in the Hippodrome to choose
their nominees to the general staff of the National Guard. Suddenly throughout
Paris, from one end to the other, a rumor spread as quick as lightning, to the
effect that the workers had met armed in the Champ de Mars, under the
leadership of Louis Blanc, Blanqui, Cabet, and Raspail, in order to march
thence on the <i>Hôtel de Ville</i>, overthrow the Provisional Government, and
proclaim a communist government. The general alarm is sounded –
Ledru-Rollin, Marrast, and Lamartine later contended for the honor of having
initiated this – and in an hour 100,000 men are under arms; the Hôtel de
Ville is occupied at all points by the National Guard; the cry Down with the
Communists! Down with Louis Blanc, with Blanqui, with Raspail, with Cabet!
thunders throughout Paris. Innumerable deputations pay homage to the
Provisional Government, all ready to save the fatherland and society. When the
workers finally appear before the <i>Hôtel de Ville</i>, in order to hand over
to the Provisional Government a patriotic collection they had made in the Champ
de Mars, they learn to their amazement that bourgeois Paris has defeated their
shadow in a very carefully calculated sham battle. The terrible attempt of
April 16 furnished the excuse for <i>recalling the army to Paris</i> –
the real purpose of the clumsily staged comedy and for the reactionary
federalist demonstrations in the provinces.</p>
<p>On May 4 the <i>National Assembly</i><a href="#n4"><sup class="enote">[4]</sup></a> met the result of the <i>direct general
elections</i>, convened. Universal suffrage did not possess the magic power
which republicans of the old school had ascribed to it. They saw in the whole
of France, at least in the majority of Frenchmen, <i>citoyens</i> [citizens]
with the same interests, the same understanding, etc. This was their <i>cult
of the people</i>. Instead of their <i>imaginary</i> people, the elections
brought the <i>real</i> people to the light of day; that is, representatives
of the different classes into which it falls. We have seen why peasants and
petty bourgeois had to vote under the leadership of a bourgeoisie spoiling for
a fight and of big landowners frantic for restoration. But if universal
suffrage was not the miracle – working magic wand the republican worthies
had taken it for, it possessed the incomparable higher merit of unchaining the
class struggle, of letting the various middle strata of bourgeois society
rapidly get over their illusions and disappointments, of tossing all the
sections of the exploiting class at one throw to the apex of the state, and
thus tearing from them their deceptive mask, whereas the monarchy with its
property qualifications had let only certain factions of the bourgeoisie
compromise themselves, allowing the others to lie hidden behind the scenes and
surrounding them with the halo of a common opposition.</p>
<p>In the Constituent National Assembly, which met on May 4, the <i>bourgeois
republicans</i>, the republicans of the <i>National</i>, had the upper hand.
Even Legitimists and Orléanists at first dared to show themselves only under
the mask of bourgeois republicanism. The fight against the proletariat could be
undertaken only in the name of the republic.</p>
<p><i>The republic dates from May 4, not from February 25</i> – that
is, the republic recognized by the French people; it is not the republic which
the Paris proletariat thrust upon the Provisional Government, not the republic
with social institutions, not the vision that hovered before the fighters on
the barricades. The republic proclaimed by the National Assembly, the sole
legitimate republic, is a republic which is no revolutionary weapon against the
bourgeois order, but rather its political reconstitution, the political
reconsolidation of bourgeois society; in a word, a <i>bourgeois republic</i>.
This contention resounded from the tribune of the National Assembly, and in the
entire republican and anti-republican bourgeois press it found its echo.</p>
<p>And we have seen how the February Republic in reality was not and could not
be other than a <i>bourgeois</i> republic; how the Provisional Government,
nevertheless, was forced by the immediate pressure of the proletariat to
announce it as a <i>republic with social institutions</i>; how the Paris
proletariat was still incapable of going beyond the bourgeois republic
otherwise than in its <i>fancy</i>, in <i>imagination</i>; how even where
the republic acted in the service of the bourgeoisie when it really came to
action; how the promises made to it became an unbearable danger for the new
republic; how the whole life process of the Provisional Government was
comprised in a continuous fight against the demands of the proletariat.</p>
<p>In the National Assembly all France sat in judgment upon the Paris
proletariat. The Assembly broke immediately with the social illusions of the
February Revolution; it roundly proclaimed the <i>bourgeois republic</i>,
nothing but the bourgeois republic. It at once excluded the representatives of
the proletariat, Louis Blanc and Albert, from the Executive Commission<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.html#n78" target=_blank>[78]</a></sup> it had appointed; it threw
out the proposal of a special Labor Ministry and received with acclamation the
statement of Minister Trélat: “The question now is merely one of
<i>bringing labor back to its old conditions.</i>” <span class="context">[from Trélat's speech of 20 June 1848]</span></p>
<p>But all this was not enough. The February Republic was won by the workers
with the passive support of the bourgeoisie. The proletarians rightly regarded
themselves as the victors of February, and they made the arrogant claims of
victors. They had to be vanquished in the streets, they had to be shown that
they were worsted as soon as they did not fight <i>with</i> the bourgeoisie,
but <i>against</i> the bourgeoisie. Just as the February Republic, with its
socialist concessions, required a battle of the proletariat, united with the
bourgeoisie, against the monarchy, so a second battle was necessary to sever
the republic from socialist concessions, to officially work out the
<i>bourgeois republic</i> as dominant. The bourgeoisie had to refute, arms in
hand, the demands of the proletariat. And the real birthplace of the bourgeois
republic is not the <i>February victory</i>; it is the <i>June
defeat.</i></p>
<p>The proletariat hastened the decision when, on the fifteenth of May, it
pushed its way into the National Assembly sought in vain to recapture its
revolutionary influence, and only delivered its energetic leaders to the
jailers of the bourgeoisie. <i>Il faut en finir</i>! This situation must end!
With this cry the National Assembly gave vent to its determination to force the
proletariat into a decisive struggle. The Executive Commission issued a series
of provocative decrees, such as that prohibiting congregations of people,<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.html#n80" target=_blank>[80]</a></sup> etc. The workers were
directly provoked, insulted, and derided from the tribune of the Constituent
National Assembly. But the real point of the attack was, as we have seen, the
<i>national ateliers</i>. The Constituent Assembly imperiously pointed these
out to the Executive Commission, which waited only to hear its own plan
proclaimed the command of the National Assembly.</p>
<p>The Executive Commission began by making admission to the national
<i>ateliers</i> more difficult, by turning the day wage into a piece wage, by
banishing workers not born in Paris to the Sologne, ostensibly for the
construction of earthworks. These earthworks were only a rhetorical formula
with which to embellish their exile, as the workers, returning disillusioned,
announced to their comrades. Finally, on June 21, a decree appeared in the
<i>Moniteur</i> which ordered the forcible expulsion of all unmarried workers
from the national <i>ateliers</i> or their enrollment in the army.<sup class="enote"><a href="notes.html#n81" target=_blank>[81]</a></sup></p>
<p>The workers were left no choice; they had to starve or let fly. They
answered on June 22 with the tremendous insurrection in which the first great
battle was fought between the two classes that split modern society. It was a
fight for the preservation or annihilation of the <i>bourgeois</i> order. The
veil that shrouded the republic was torn asunder.</p>
<p>It is well known how the workers, with unexampled bravery and ingenuity,
without leaders, without a common plan, without means and, for the most part,
lacking weapons, held in check for five days the army, the Mobile Guard, the
Paris National Guard, and the National Guard that streamed in from the
provinces. It is well known how the bourgeoisie compensated itself for the
mortal anguish it suffered by unheard–of brutality, massacring over 3000
prisoners. The official representatives of French democracy were steeped in
republican ideology to such an extent that it was only some weeks later that
they began to have an inkling of the significance of the June fight. They were
stupefied by the gunpowder smoke in which their fantastic republic
dissolved.</p>
<p>The immediate impression which the news of the June defeat made on us, the
reader will allow us to describe in the words of the “Neue Rheinische
Zeitung.” <a href="#n5"><sup class="enote">[5]</sup></a></p>
<p class="indentb">“The Executive Committee,<sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume07/footnote.html#116" target=_blank>[116]</a></sup> that last official
vestige of the February revolution, vanished like a ghost in the face of these
grave events. Lamartine's fireworks have turned into the incendiary shells of
Cavaignac.</p>
<p class="indentb">“<i>Fraternité</i>, the brotherhood of antagonistic
classes, one of which exploits the other, this fraternity which in February was
proclaimed and inscribed in large letters on the facades of Paris, on every
prison and every barracks – this fraternity found its true, unadulterated
and prosaic expression in civil war, civil war in its most terrible aspect, the
war of labor against capital. This brotherhood blazed in front of the windows
of Paris on the evening of June 25, when the Paris of the bourgeoisie held
illuminations while the Paris of the proletariat was burning, bleeding,
groaning in the throes of death.</p>
<p class="indentb">“This <i>fraternité</i> lasted only as long as there
was a consanguinity of interests between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.
Pedants sticking to the old revolutionary tradition of 1793; socialist
doctrinaires who begged alms for the people from the bourgeoisie and who were
allowed to deliver lengthy sermons and compromise themselves so long as the
proletarian lion had to be lulled to sleep; republicans who wanted to keep the
old bourgeois order in toto, but without the crowned head; members of the
Dynastic Opposition <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume07/footnote.html#117" target=_blank>[117]</a></sup> on whom chance
imposed the task of bringing about the downfall of a dynasty instead of a
change of government; legitimists, <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume07/footnote.html#118" target=_blank>[118]</a></sup> who did not want to
cast off their livery but merely to change its style – these were the
allies with whom the people had fought their February revolution. What the
people instinctively hated in Louis Philip was not Louis Philip himself, but
the crowned rule of a class, the capital on the throne. But magnanimous as
always, the people thought they had destroyed their enemy when they had
overthrown the enemy of their enemies, their common enemy.</p>
<p class="indentb">“The February revolution was the nice revolution, the
revolution of universal sympathies, because the contradictions which erupted in
it against the monarchy were still undeveloped and peacefully dormant, because
the social struggle which formed their background had only achieved an
ephemeral existence, an existence in phrases, in words. The June revolution is
the ugly revolution, the nasty revolution, because the phrases have given place
to the real thing, because the republic has bared the head of the monster by
knocking off the crown which shielded and concealed it.</p>
<p class="indentb">“<i>Order!</i> was Guizot's war-cry. <i>Order!</i>
shouted Sebastiani, the Guizotist, when Warsaw became Russian. <i>Order!</i>
shouts Cavaignac, the brutal echo of the French National Assembly and of the
republican bourgeoisie. <i>Order!</i> thundered his grape-shot as it tore into
the body of the proletariat.</p>
<p class="indentb">“None of the numerous revolutions of the French
bourgeoisie since 1789 assailed the existing order, for they retained the class
rule, the slavery of the workers, the bourgeois system, even though the
political form of this rule and this slavery changed frequently. The June
uprising did assail this system. Woe to the June uprising!”</p>
<p>Woe to that June! Re-echoes Europe.</p>
<p>The Paris proletariat <i>was forced</i> into the June insurrection by the
bourgeoisie. This sufficed to mark its doom. Its immediate, avowed needs did
not drive it to engage in a fight for the forcible overthrow of the
bourgeoisie, nor was it equal to this task. The <i>Moniteur</i> had to inform
it officially that the time was past when the republic saw any occasion to bow
and scrape to its illusions, and only its defeat convinced it of the truth that
the slightest improvement in its position remains a utopia <i>within</i> the
bourgeois republic, <i>a utopia</i> that becomes a crime as soon as it wants
to become a reality. In place of the demands, exuberant in form but still
limited and even bourgeois in content, whose concession the proletariat wanted
to wring from the February Republic, there appeared the bold slogan of
revolutionary struggle: <i>Overthrow of the bourgeoisie! Dictatorship of the
Working class!</i></p>
<p>By making its burial place the birthplace of the <i>bourgeois
republic</i>, the proletariat compelled the latter to come out forthwith in
its pure form as the state whose admitted object it is to perpetuate the rule
of capital, the slavery of labor. Having constantly before its eyes the
scarred, irreconcilable, invincible enemy – invincible because its
existence is the condition of its own life – bourgeois rule, freed from
all fetters, was bound to turn immediately into <i>bourgeois terrorism</i>.
With the proletariat removed for the time being from the stage and bourgeois
dictatorship recognized officially, the middle strata of bourgeois society, the
petty bourgeoisie and the peasant class, had to adhere more and more closely to
the proletariat as their position became more unbearable and their antagonism
to the bourgeoisie more acute. Just as earlier they had to find the cause of
their distress in its upsurge, so now in its defeat.</p>
<p>If the June insurrection raised the self-assurance of the bourgeoisie all
over the Continent, and caused it to league itself openly with the feudal
monarchy against the people, who was the first victim of this alliances The
continental bourgeoisie itself. The June defeat prevented it from consolidating
its rule and from bringing the people, half satisfied and half out of humor, to
a standstill at the lowest stage of the bourgeois revolution.</p>
<p>Finally, the defeat of June divulged to the despotic powers of Europe the
secret that France must maintain peace abroad at any price in order to be able
to wage civil war at home. Thus the people's who had begun the fight for their
national independence were abandoned to the superior power of Russia, Austria,
and Prussian, but at the same time the fate of these national revolutions was
made subject to the fate of the proletarian revolution, and they were robbed of
their apparent autonomy, their independence of the great social revolution. The
Hungarian shall not be free, nor the Pole, nor the Italian, as long as the
worker remains a slave!</p>
<p>Finally, with the victories of the Holy Alliance, Europe has taken on a form
that makes every fresh proletarian upheaval in France directly coincide with a
<i>world war</i>. The new French revolution is forced to leave its national
soil forthwith and <i>conquer the European terrain</i>, on which alone the
social revolution of the nineteenth century can be accomplished.</p>
<p>Thus only the June defeat has created all the conditions under which France
can seize the <i>initiative</i> of the European revolution. Only after being
dipped in the blood of the <i>June insurgents</i> did the tricolor become the
flag of the European revolution – the <i>red flag!</i></p>
<p>And we exclaim: <i>The revolution is dead! Long live the
revolution!</i></p>

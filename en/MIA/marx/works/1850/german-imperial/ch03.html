<p class="title">The Campaign for the German Imperial Constitution, Frederick
Engels 1850</p>
<h1>III. The Palatinate</h1>
<p>From Karlsruhe we went to the Palatinate <span class="context">[Marx and
Engels left Karlsruhe for the Palatinate on May 24, 1849.–Ed]</span>
first stopping at Speyer where d'Ester and the Provisional Government were said
to be. They had, however, already left for Kaiserslautern, where the government
finally took up its seat at what it considered to be the "strategically best
located point in the Palatinate". In its stead we found Willich and his
volunteers in Speyer. With a corps of a few hundred men he was holding in check
the garrisons of Landau and Germersheim, altogether over 4,000 men, cutting
their lines of supply and harassing them in every possible way. That very day
he had attacked two companies of the Germersheim garrison with about eighty
riflemen and driven them back into the fortress without firing a single shot.
The next day we accompanied Willich to Kaiserslautern where we met d'Ester, the
Provisional Government, and the very flower of German democracy. Here also
there could, of course, be no question of official participation in the
movement, which was quite alien to our party. So after a few days we went back
to Bingen, were arrested on the way, in the company of several friends, by
Hessian troops, on suspicion of being implicated in the uprising, transported
to Darmstadt and from there to Frankfurt, where we were finally set free.</p>
<p>Shortly after this we left Bingen and Marx went with a mandate from the
Democratic Central Committee to Paris, where a crucial event was about to take
place, as representative of the German revolutionary party to the French
social-democrats.<sup class="enote"><a href="#164">[164]</a></sup> I returned
to Kaiserslautern to live there for the time being as a simple political
refugee and perhaps later, should a suitable opportunity offer itself, take up
at the outbreak of fighting the only position that the <i>Neue Rheinische
Zeitung</i> could take up in this movement: that of soldier.</p>
<p>Anyone who has seen the Palatinate even once will understand that in this
wine-producing and wine-loving province any movement inevitably assumes a most
cheerful character. The ponderous, pedantic, Old-Bavarian beer-souls had at
long last been shaken off and merry Palatinate wine-bibbers appointed in their
place. One had finally seen the last of that pompous pettifoggery practised by
the Bavarian police which was so delightfully parodied in the otherwise dull
pages of the <i>Fliegende Blätter</i> and which lay more heavily than
anything else on the hearts of the gay people of the Palatinate. The first
revolutionary act of the people of the Palatinate was to restore the freedom of
the taverns; the entire Palatinate was transformed into one enormous pot-house
and the quantities of strong drink which were consumed "in the name of the
people of the Palatinate" during those six weeks were beyond all calculation.
Even though active participation in the movement in the Palatinate was nowhere
near as widespread as in Baden, and even though there were many reactionary
districts here, the entire population was as one in this general wine-bibbing
and even the most reactionary philistine and peasant was carried along on the
general wave of merriment.</p>
<p>One did not need an especially penetrating glance to recognise how bitterly
the Prussian army was to disillusion these cheerful Palatinate souls in a few
weeks' time. And yet the number of people in the Palatinate who did not revel
in the most carefree manner could be counted on one's fingers. Scarcely anyone
believed that the Prussians would come, but everyone was quite sure that if
they did come they would be thrown out again with the greatest of ease. There
was no trace here of that staunch gloominess whose motto <i>"Ernst ist der
Mann"</i><span class="context">[Seriousness above all things.
–Ed]</span> is engraved on the brow of every Baden people's militia
officer and which still did not prevent all those wonderful things happening
which I shall have to relate presently - that respectable solemnity which the
philistine character of the movement in Baden had impressed on the majority of
its participants. In the Palatinate people were only "serious" by the way. Here
"enthusiasm" and "seriousness" only served to gloss over the universal jollity.
But people were always "serious" and "enthusiastic" enough to believe
themselves invincible before any power in the world, and especially the
Prussian army; and if in the quiet hours of reflection a faint doubt raised its
head, it was brushed aside with the irrefutable argument that even if it were
true, one still should not say it. The longer the movement dragged on and the
more undeniable and massive the concentration of Prussian battalions between
Saarbrucken and Kreuznach, the more frequent became these doubts, and the more
vehement the bluster, precisely among the doubters and the timid, about the
invincibility of a "people enraptured with its freedom", as the people of the
Palatinate were called. This bluster soon grew into a regular soporific system
which, encouraged only too readily by the government, had the effect of
relaxing all work on defence measures and exposing everyone who opposed it to
the danger of arrest as a reactionary.</p>
<p>This carefree attitude, this bluster about "enthusiasm" carrying all before
it, in view of its minute material resources and the tiny corner of land where
it asserted itself, provided the comic side of the Palatinate "uprising", and
gave the handful of people whose advanced views and independent position
permitted a detached judgment more than enough cause for hilarity.</p>
<p>The whole outward appearance of the movement in the Palatinate was cheerful,
carefree and spontaneous. Whereas in Baden every newly appointed second
lieutenant, in the regular army or the people's militia, laced himself into a
heavy uniform and paraded with silver epaulettes which later, on the day of the
battle, immediately found their way into his pockets, people in the Palatinate
were much more sensible. As soon as the great heat of the first days of June
made itself felt all the worsted coats, waistcoats and cravats disappeared to
make way for a light tunic. It seemed as if all the old unsociable constraints
had been thrown off along with the old bureaucracy. People dressed in a
completely free-and-easy fashion, dictated solely by comfort and the season of
the year; and together with differentiation in clothing disappeared in a moment
every other differentiation in social intercourse. All social classes came
together in the same public places and in this unrestrained intercourse a
socialist dreamer would have glimpsed the dawn of universal brotherhood.</p>
<p>As the Palatinate, so its Provisional Government. It consisted almost
exclusively of genial wine-bibbers, who were never so astonished as when they
suddenly found themselves having to be the Provisional Government of their
Bacchus-beloved fatherland. And yet there is no denying that these laughing
regents conducted themselves better and accomplished relatively more than their
Baden neighbours under the leadership of the "staunch-minded" Brentano. They
were at least well-intentioned and in spite of their carousing had a more sober
understanding than the philistine-serious gentlemen in Karlsruhe; and hardly
any of them became angry if one laughed at their easy-going fashion of making
revolution and their impotent little decrees.</p>
<p>The Provisional Government of the Palatinate could not get anything done as
long as it was left in the lurch by the Baden government. And it completely
fulfilled its obligations towards Baden. It sent envoy after envoy and made one
concession after another solely in order to come to an understanding, but all
in vain. Herr Brentano was obdurate.</p>
<p>While the Baden government found everything ready at hand, the Palatinate
government found nothing. It had no money, no weapons, a number of reactionary
districts and two enemy fortresses on its territory. France at once banned the
export of arms to Baden and the Palatinate, and all arms dispatched thither
were impounded by Prussia and Hesse. The government of the Palatinate sent
agents forthwith to France and Belgium to buy up arms and send them back; the
arms were purchased but they never arrived. The government can be reproached
with not proceeding with sufficient energy in the matter and in particular with
failing to organise the smuggling in of rifles through the large number of
contrabandists along the frontier; the greater blame, however, lies with its
agents, who acted very negligently and in part allowed themselves to be fobbed
off with empty promises instead of getting the French arms at least as far as
Saargemund and Lauterburg.</p>
<p>As far as funds were concerned, not much could be done with bank-notes in
the little Palatinate. When the government found itself in pecuniary
embarrassment it at least had the courage to take refuge in a forced loan on a
progressive, albeit gently graduated, scale.</p>
<p>The only reproaches which can be made against the Palatinate government are
that in its feeling of impotence it allowed itself to be too much infected by
the universal light-heartedness and the related illusions about its own
security; and that therefore, instead of energetically setting in motion the
admittedly limited means of defending the state, it preferred to rely on the
victory of the Montagne in Paris, the taking of Vienna by the Hungarians or
even on actual miracles which were to happen somewhere or other to save the
Palatinate –uprisings in the Prussian army, etc. Hence the remissness in
procuring arms in a country where even a thousand serviceable muskets more or
less would have made an infinite amount of difference and where finally, on the
day the Prussians marched in, the first and last consignment of <i>forty</i>
rifles arrived from abroad, namely from Switzerland. Hence the frivolous
selection of civil and military commissaries, who consisted mainly of the most
incompetent and confused dreamers, and the retention of so many old officials
and of all the judges. Hence finally the neglect of all the means, even those
immediately at hand, of harassing and perhaps taking Landau. To this question I
shall return later.</p>
<p>Behind the Provisional Government stood d'Ester, like a sort of secret
General Secretary or, as Herr Brentano put it, like a "red camarilla which
surrounded the moderate government of Kaiserslautern". Moreover, this "red
camarilla" included other German democrats too, in particular Dresden refugees.
In d'Ester the Palatinate regents found that broad administrative vision which
they lacked, together with a revolutionary understanding which impressed them
because it always confined itself to what was immediately at hand, to that
which was unquestionably practicable, and was therefore never at a loss for
detailed measures. Because of this d'Ester acquired a significant influence and
the unconditional confidence of the government. If even he at times took the
movement too seriously and thought for example that he could achieve something
worthwhile through the introduction of his for the moment totally unsuitable
municipal regulations, it is none the less certain that d'Ester impelled the
Provisional Government to each comparatively vigorous step and in particular
always had appropriate solutions at hand when it came to conflicts over
details.</p>
<p>If in Rhenish Prussia reactionary and revolutionary classes stood facing
each other from the very outset and if in Baden a class which was initially in
raptures about the movement, the petty bourgeoisie, gradually allowed itself at
the approach of danger to be won over first into indifference and later into
hostility towards the movement it itself had provoked, in the Palatinate it was
not so much particular classes of the population as particular districts which,
governed by local interests, declared themselves against the movement, some
from the first and others little by little. Certainly the townspeople of Speyer
were reactionary from the start; in Kaiserslautern, Neustadt, Zweibrucken,
etc., they became so with the passage of time; but the main strength of the
reactionary party was to be found in agricultural districts spread over the
whole of the Palatinate. This confused configuration of the parties could only
have been eliminated by one measure: a direct attack on the private property
invested in mortgages and mortgage-usury, in favour of the debt-ridden peasants
who had been sucked dry by the usurers. But this single measure, which would
immediately have given the whole of the rural population a stake in the
uprising, presupposes a much larger territory and much more developed social
conditions in the towns than is the case in the Palatinate. It was only
feasible at the beginning of the insurrection, simultaneously with an extension
of the uprising to the Moselle and the Eifel, where the same conditions obtain
on the land and find their complement in the industrial development of the
Rhenish towns. And the movement was directed outwards just as little in the
Palatinate as it was in Baden.</p>
<p>Under these conditions the government had only limited means of combating
the reactionary districts: isolated military expeditions into the refractory
villages, arrests, especially of the Catholic priests, who placed themselves at
the head of the resistance, and so on; appointment of energetic civil and
military commissaries, and last of all propaganda. The expeditions, mostly of a
very comical nature, only had a momentary effect, the propaganda none at all,
and the commissaries mostly committed blunder upon blunder in their pompous
ineptitude or confined themselves to the consumption of vast quantities of
Palatinate wine and the inevitable bluster in the taverns.</p>
<p>Amongst the propagandists, the commissaries and the officials of the central
administration, the democrats, of whom even more had gathered in the Palatinate
than in Baden, played a very considerable role. Here, in addition to the
refugees from Dresden and from Rhenish Prussia, a number of more or less
enthusiastic "men of the people" had turned up to consecrate themselves to the
service of the fatherland. The government of the Palatinate, which unlike its
Karlsruhe counterpart understood instinctively that the resources of the
Palatinate alone were not equal to the demands even of this movement, received
them gladly. It was impossible to spend more than two hours in the Palatinate
without being offered a dozen of the most varied and on the whole very
honourable posts. The democrats, who saw in the Palatinate-Baden movement not a
local uprising which was becoming daily more local and more insignificant, but
the glorious dawn of the glorious uprising of all Germany's democrats, and who
everywhere in the movement saw their more or less petty bourgeois tendency
prevailing, fell over themselves to accept these offers. At the same time,
however, each felt he owed it to himself only to accept a post which satisfied
his naturally very lofty pretensions of the part he should play in an
all-German movement. At first this was possible. Whoever came along was at once
put in charge of an office or made a government commissary, a major or a
lieutenant-colonel. Little by little, however, the number of rivals increased,
the positions became fewer and there started a petty, philistine place-hunting
which presented the disinterested spectator with a highly diverting spectacle.
I imagine I do not have to underline the fact that in this strange hotchpotch
of industry and confusion, importunacy and incompetence which the <i>Neue
Rheinische Zeitung</i> has so often had occasion to wonder at among the German
democrats, the officials and propagandists of the Palatinate faithfully
mirrored the whole unpleasant medley.</p>
<p>As a matter of course I also was offered any number of civil and military
positions, positions which in a proletarian movement I would not have hesitated
for a moment to accept. As things were, I turned them all down. The only thing
I agreed to was to write some agitational articles for a small paper of which
the Provisional Government had large quantities distributed in the Palatinate.
I knew that this too would come to nothing, but I finally accepted the offer
upon the urgent request of d'Ester and several members of the government in
order at least to demonstrate my good will. Since I naturally felt few
constraints, exception was taken to the very second article I wrote because it
was too "inflammatory"; I wasted no words, took the article back, tore it up in
d'Ester's presence and that was the end of the matter.</p>
<p>The best of the foreign democrats in the Palatinate were, incidentally,
those who had come fresh from the struggle in their home provinces: the Saxons
and the Rhenish Prussians. The handful of Saxons were mostly employed in the
central offices, where they worked hard and distinguished themselves by their
administrative knowledge, their calm, clear understanding and their lack of any
pretensions or illusions. The Rhinelanders, mostly workers, joined the army
<i>en masse;</i> the few who initially worked in the offices later also took
up the musket.</p>
<p>In the offices of the central administration in the Fruchthalle<sup class="enote"><a href="#165">[165]</a></sup> at Kaiserslautern there was a very
easy-going atmosphere. What with the general <i>laisser aller</i>, the
complete lack of any form of active intervention in the movement and the
uncommonly large number of officials, there was on the whole little to do. It
was a matter of hardly more than the day-to-day business of administration, and
this was disposed of <i>tant bien que mal</i>. Unless a courier arrived, some
patriotic citizen came with a profound proposal concerning the salvation of the
fatherland, some peasant brought a complaint or some village sent a deputatlon,
most of the offices had nothing to do. People yawned and chatted, told
anecdotes and made bad jokes and strategic plans and went from one office to
another trying as well as they could to kill time. The main topics of
conversation were naturally the political events of the day, about which the
most contradictory rumours were circulating. The intelligence service was
greatly neglected. The old post-office officials had almost without exception
stayed at their posts and were needless to say very unreliable. Alongside them
a "field-post" was set up, superintended by the Palatinate Chevaulegers<sup class="enote"><a href="#166">[166]</a></sup> who had come over to our side. The
commandants and the commissaries of the border areas paid not the slightest
heed to what was happening on the other side of the border. The government took
only the <i>Frankfurter Journal</i> and the <i>Karlsruher Zeitung</i> and I
still remember with delight the astonishment it gave rise to when I discovered
in the officers' club, in an issue of the <i>Kolnische Zeitung</i> which had
arrived several days before, the news of the concentration of 27 Prussian
battalions, 9 batteries and 9 regiments of cavalry, together with their exact
location between Saarbrucken and Kreuznach.</p>
<p>At last I come to the main point, the military organisation. About three
thousand Palatinate soldiers from the Bavarian army had defected with bag and
baggage. At the same time a number of volunteers, from the Palatinate and
elsewhere, had placed themselves under arms. In addition to that the
Provisional Government issued a decree calling up the first age group, in the
first instance all unmarried men between the ages of eighteen and thirty. This
call-up, however, only took place on paper, owing partly to the incompetence
and negligence of the military commissaries, partly to the lack of arms and
partly to the indolence of the government itself. Wherever the lack of arms was
the main obstacle to the whole defence, as it was in the Palatinate, every
means had to be used to muster arms. If none were forthcoming from abroad, then
it was necessary to fetch out every musket, every rifle and every sporting-gun
which could be unearthed in the Palatinate and place them in the hands of the
active fighters. However, there were not only large numbers of private weapons
at hand, but on top of that at least another 1,500 to 2,000 rifles, not
counting carbines, in the hands of the various civic militia units. One could
at least have demanded the handing over of private arms and rifles in the hands
of those civic militiamen who were not obliged to join the first call-up and
did not intend to volunteer. But nothing of the sort happened. After much
insistence a resolution along these lines was finally adopted regarding the
arms held by the civic militia, but never put into effect the Kaiserslautern
civic militia over three hundred philistines strong, paraded at the Fruchthalle
every day in uniform, shouldering their arms, and the Prussians, when they
marched in, had the pleasure of disarming these gentlemen. And thus it was
everywhere.</p>
<p>In the official newspaper an appeal was issued to the forestry officials and
the keepers of the woods, asking them to report to Kaiserslautern in order to
form rifle corps; of these it was the forestry officials who did not turn
up.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole land scythes were forged, or at least a call went out
to that effect; a few scythes were actually produced. In the Rhenish Hessian
corps at Kirchheimbolanden I saw several casks of scythe-blades being loaded
and sent to Kaiserslautern. The journey takes roughly seven to eight hours;
four days later the government was forced to abandon Kaiserslautern to the
Prussians and the scythes had still not arrived. If the scythes had been given
to those civic militiamen not yet mobilised, the so-called second age group, as
compensation for giving up their guns, then the affair would have made sense;
instead of this the lazy philistines kept their percussion-guns and the young
recruits were expected to march against the Prussian cannon and needle-muskets
with scythes.</p>
<p>While there was a general lack of fire-arms, there was by contrast a just as
remarkable profusion of cavalry sabres; those who could not lay hands on a gun
strapped on all the more eagerly a clattering broadsword, believing that by
merely so doing they stamped themselves as officers. Precisely in
Kaiserslautern these self-stamped officers were too numerous to count and the
streets rang day and night to the clatter of their fearful weapons. It was the
students in particular who by this new manner of intimidating the enemy and by
their pretension of forming an academic legion entirely of cavalry on foot
rendered great service for the saving of the fatherland.</p>
<p>In addition there was half a squadron of defected Chevaulegers at hand;
however, they were so scattered due to their work for the field-post, etc.,
that they never came to form a special combat corps. The artillery, under the
command of "Lieutenant-Colonel" Anneke, consisted of a few three-pounders whose
horses I do not recall having ever seen, and a number of mortars. Lying in
front of the Fruchthalle at Kaiserslautern was the most beautiful collection of
old iron cannon-barrels one could ever wish to see. Needless to say, most of
them remained lying there unused. The two biggest were laid on colossal
home-made gun-carriages and carried off. The Baden government finally sold the
Palatinate a shot-out six-pound battery together with some ammunition; but
without a team of horses, a crew of sufficient ammunition. The ammunition was
as far as possible manufactured; the team of horses and riders was made up
<i>tant bien que mal</i> with requisitioned peasants and horses; for the crew
a few old Bavarian artillerymen were gathered together to train men in the
ponderous and complicated Bavarian drill.</p>
<p>The top leadership of military affairs was in the worst hands. Herr
Reichardt, who had taken over the military department in the Provisional
Government, was active, but lacked vigour and professional knowledge. The first
commander-in-chief of the military forces of the Palatinate, the enterprising
Fenner von Fenneberg, was soon dismissed on account of his ambiguous conduct;
he was temporarily replaced by Raquilliet, a Polish officer. At last it was
learnt that Mieroslawski was to take over the supreme command of Baden and the
Palatinate and that the command of the troops of the Palatinate was to be
entrusted to "General" Sznayde, also a Pole.</p>
<p>General Sznayde arrived. He was a small, fat man, who looked more like an
elderly <i>bon vivant</i> than a "Menelaus, caller to battle"." General
Sznayde took over the command with a great deal of gravity. He had a report
made on the state of affairs and at once issued a whole series of orders of the
day. Most of these orders related to uniform (tunics and marks of rank for
officers – tricolour armbands or sashes), or appeals to veteran
cavalrymen and riflemen to come forward as volunteers (appeals which had
already been made ten times without success) and things of a similar nature. He
himself set a good example by immediately procuring a hussar tunic with
tricolour braid, in order to inspire the army with respect. The really
practical and important things in his orders of the day were merely repetitions
of orders long since issued and proposals already made earlier by the handful
of good officers present, but never carried out, and which only now, through
the authority of a commanding general, could b be put into effect. As for the
rest, "General" Sznayde placed his trust in God and Mieroslawski and dedicated
himself to the pleasures of the table, the only reasonable thing that a so
totally incompetent individual could do.</p>
<p>Amongst the other officers in Kaiserslautern was the uniquely capable
Techow, the same Techow who as a Prussian first lieutenant with Natzmer and
gave the Berlin arsenal over to the people after having taken it by storm <sup class="enote"><a href="#167">[167]</a></sup> and, sentenced to fifteen years
detention in a fortress, escaped from Magdeburg. Techow, chief of the
Palatinate general staff, proved in all things to be knowledgeable, circumspect
and calm, perhaps a little too calm to be trusted to make the rapid decisions
on which everything often depends on the battlefield. "Lieutenant-Colonel"
Anneke proved to he incompetent and indolent in organising the artillery,
though he rendered good services in the ordnance shops. At Ubstadt he won no
laurels as commander-in-chief and from Rastatt, where Mieroslawski had put him
in charge of the materials for the siege, he escaped across the Rhine under
strange circumstances already before the investment, leaving his horses
behind.</p>
<p>There was not much to be said for the officers in the various districts
either. A number of Poles had appeared, some in advance of Sznayde and some
with him. As the best of the Polish emigres were already in Hungary, one may
suspect that these Polish officers were a pretty mixed bunch. Most of them made
haste to obtain an appropriate number of saddle-horses and give out a few
orders, paying only scanty attention to their execution. They tended to lord it
over people and wanted to treat the peasants of the Palatinate like cringing
Polish serfs. They were not familiar with the country, the language or the
command, and hence accomplished little or nothing at all as military
commissaries, i.e. organisers of battalions. In the course of the campaign they
soon strayed into Sznayde's headquarters and shortly afterwards, when Sznayde
was assailed and roughly handled by his soldiers, disappeared altogether. The
better ones among them arrived too late to be able to organise anything.</p>
<p>There was not much talent of any use among the German officers either. The
Rhenish Hessian corps, though it included elements who could have developed
militarily, was under the leadership of a certain Hausner, a completely useless
man, and under the even more lamentable moral and political influence of the
two heroes Zitz and Bamberger, who later in Karlsruhe extricated themselves so
successfully from the situation. In the Palatinate hinterland a former Prussian
officer, Schimmelpfennig, organised a corps.</p>
<p>The only two officers who had already distinguished themselves in active
service before the Prussian invasion were Willich and Blenker.</p>
<p>With a small corps of volunteers Willich took over the observation and later
the siege of Landau and Germersheim. A company of students, a company of
workers who had lived with him in Besancon, three weak companies of gymnasts
(from Landau, Nerrstadt and Kaiserlautern), two companies formed from
volunteers from the surrounding villages and lastly a company of Rhenish
Prussians armed with scythes, most of them fugitives from the Prum and
Elberfeld uprisings, gradually mustered under his command. In the end they
amounted to between 700 and 800 men, certainly the most reliable soldiers in
the whole Palatinate; most of the N.C.O.s had seen service and some of them had
been familiarised in Algeria with guerrilla warfare.<sup class="enote"><a href="#168">[168]</a></sup> With this scanty force Willich took up a position
halfway between Landau and Germersheim, organised the civic militia in the
villages, using them to guard the roads and do outpost duty, beat back all the
sorties from the two fortresses in spite of the superior forces, in particular
of the Germersheim garrison, blockaded Landau so effectively that almost all
its supplies were intercepted, cut off its water-supplies, dammed up the Queich
so that all the fortress cellars were flooded, and yet there was a lack of
drinking-water, and harassed the garrison every night with patrols which not
only cleared out the abandoned outworks and auctioned the guardroom stoves they
found there for five guilders each, but also pushed forward even into the
fortress trenches and frequently caused the garrison to open fire on a corporal
and two men with a cannonade of twenty-four-pounders which was as intense as it
was harmless. This was by far the most brilliant period during the existence of
Willich's volunteer corps. If only a few howitzers had been at his disposal at
that time, or even only field-guns, according to the reports of the spies who
daily went in and out of Landau, the fortress, with its demoralised, weak
garrison and its rebellious inhabitants, would have been taken in a few days.
Even without artillery a continuation of the siege would have compelled
capitulation in a week. In Kaiserslautern were two seven-pound howitzers, good
enough to set fire to a few houses in Landau during the night. Had they been on
the spot, then the unheard of, the taking of a fortress like Landau with a few
field-guns, would have become a probability. Every day I preached to the
general staff in Kaiserslautern the necessity of at least making the attempt.
To no avail. One of the howitzers stayed in Kaiserslautern and the other found
its way to Homburg, where it almost fell into the hands of the Prussians. Both
came over the Rhine without having fired a shot.</p>
<p>"Colonel" Blenker, however, distinguished himself even more than Willich.
"Colonel" Blenker, a former travelling salesman for a wine-firm, who had been
in Greece as a philhellenist and later set himself up as a wine-merchant in
Worms, can in any case be numbered among the most outstanding military
personalities of the whole glorious campaign. Always on horseback, surrounded
by a numerous staff, big, strong, with a defiant face, an impressive
Hecker-type beard, a stentorian voice and all the other characteristics that go
to make up a South German "man of the people", and among which, as everybody
knows, intelligence does not exactly feature, "Colonel" Blenker gave the
impression of a man at the mere sight of whom Napoleon would have to sneak
away, a man worthy to figure in that refrain with which we opened these
accounts. "Colonel" Blenker felt he had it in himself to overthrow the German
princes even without "Hecker, Struve, Zitz and Blum" and immediately set about
the task. It was his intention to fight the war not as a soldier but as a
travelling wine-salesman, and to this end he resolved to conquer Landau.
Willich was not yet there at that time. Blenker got together everything at hand
in the Palatinate, both regular troops and people's militia, organised
foot-soldiers, cavalry and artillery that had all been jumbled up together, and
moved off in the direction of Landau. A council of war was held in front of the
fortress, the assault columns formed up and the position of the artillery
fixed. The artillery, however, consisted of a few mortars whose calibre varied
from 1/2 lb. to 1 3/8 lb., and was brought up on a hay-cart which at the same
time served to carry the ammunition. The ammunition for these various mortars
consisted of <i>one</i>, I repeat <i>one,</i> 24 lb. cannon-ball; there was
no question of any gunpowder. After everything had been organised, everyone
moved forward full of contempt for death. The glacis was reached without
meeting any resistance; the march continued, right up to the gate. At the head
were the soldiers who had defected from Landau. A few soldiers appeared on the
ramparts to parley. They were called upon to open the gate. There began already
a quite good-natured exchange and everything appeared to be going according to
wish. All at once a cannon-shot rang out from the ramparts, case-shot whistled
over the heads of the assailants and in no time the whole heroic army broke
into wild flight together with their Palatinate Prince Eugene. Everyone was
running, running, running, with such irresistible momentum that the couple of
cannon-balls loosed off soon afterwards from the ramparts were already no
longer whistling over the heads of the fleeing men, but only over their
discarded guns, cartridge-pouches and knapsacks. A few hours away from Landau a
halt was finally made and the army was gathered together again and led home by
Herr "Colonel" Blenker, without the keys of Landau but none the less proud for
that. Such is the story of the conquest, of Landau with three mortars and a 24
lb. cannon-ball that never happened.</p>
<p>The case-shot was fired off in all haste by some Bavarian officers, when
they saw that their soldiers wanted to open the gate. The gun was brought off
the target by soldiers themselves, and it was because of this that nobody was
hit. But when the Landau garrison saw what an effect this random shot had,
there was naturally no more talk of surrender.</p>
<p>Hero Blenker, however, was not the sort of man to take such a piece of bad
luck lying down. He now resolved to conquer Worms. He moved up from
Frankenthal, where he commanded a battalion. The handful of Hessian soldiers
stationed in Worms made themselves scarce and hero Blenker marched into his
home town with drums beating and trumpets sounding. After the liberation of
Worms had been celebrated with a solemn luncheon, the main ceremony began, that
is, the rendering of an oath of allegiance to the Imperial Constitution to
twenty Hessian soldiers who had stayed behind sick. During the night after this
prodigious success, however, the imperial troops under Peucker brought up
artillery on the right bank of the Rhine and gave the victorious conquerors a
most violent awakening with the early thunder of cannon. There was no mistake
about it: the imperial troops were sending over round shot and shells. Without
uttering a word hero Blenker gathered together his brave men, and stole away
from Worms back to Frankenthal. The muse will report further particulars of his
later heroic deeds in the appropriate place.</p>
<p>While in the districts the motliest collection of characters were each in
their own way giving themselves vent and the soldiers and people's militiamen,
instead of drilling, sat in the taverns and sang, the gallant officers were in
Kaiserslautern busy thinking up the most profound strategic plans. It was a
question of nothing less than the possibility of holding a small province like
the Palatinate, accessible from several sides, with almost wholly imaginary
forces against an extremely real army of over 30,000 men and 60 cannon.
Precisely because in such a situation every project was equally useless and
equally absurd, and precisely because all the conditions for any strategic plan
were absent, precisely for those reasons these profound military men, these
thinking heads of the Palatinate army, were all the more resolved to concoct
some strategic miracle which would bar to the Prussians the way into the
Palatinate. Every freshly baked lieutenant, every sabre-trailer from the
academic legion finally established under the auspices of Herr Sznayde, with
the rank of lieutenant for every member, every administrative pen-pusher,
stared pensively at the map of the Palatinate in the hope of finding the
strategic philosophers stone. It is easy to imagine the amusing results this
had. The Hungarian method of warfare was especially popular. From "General"
Sznayde down to the as yet least recognised Napoleon in the army one could
constantly hear the phrase: "We must do as Kossuth did, we must give up a piece
of our territory and retreat, here or there, into the mountains or onto the
plain according to the situation." "We must do as Kossuth did," the cry went up
in every tavern. "We must do as Kossuth did," echoed every corporal, every
soldier and every street-urchin. "We must do as Kossuth did," echoed the
Provisional Government goodnaturedly, for they knew better than anyone else
that it was best not to meddle in these things, and in the long run it was all
the same to them how it was done. "We must do as Kossuth did, or we are
lost."– The Palatinate and Kossuth!</p>
<p>Before I go on to describe the campaign itself, I must briefly mention a
matter which has been touched on in various newspapers: my momentary arrest in
Kirchheim. A few days before the Prussians marched in I accompanied my friend
Moll on a mission he had undertaken to Kirchheimbolanden, on the border. Here
was stationed a part of the Rhenish Hessian corps, in which we had
acquaintances. We were sitting in the evening with these and several other
volunteers from the corps in an inn. Among the volunteers were a number of
those serious, enthusiastic "men of action" of whom mention has been made on
more than one occasion and who foresaw no difficulties in beating any army in
the world, with few arms and much enthusiasm. These are men whose experience of
the military does not extend beyond the changing of the guards, who never pay
the slightest heed to the material means of attaining a given purpose and who
for this reason mostly experience such a shattering disillusion in their first
battle, as I was later to observe on more than one occasion, that they make off
as fast as their legs can carry them. I asked one such hero if he really
intended to defeat the Prussians with the thirty thousand cavalry sabres and
three and a half thousand fire-arms, including several rusty carbines,
available in the Palatinate, and I was in proper train to enjoy the holy
indignation of a man of action wounded in his noblest enthusiasm when in
stepped the guard and declared me under arrest. At the same time I saw two men
rush upon me from behind foaming with rage. One of them announced that he was
Civil Commissary Müller and the other was Herr Greiner, the only member of the
government with whom I had never entered into more intimate contact, on account
of his frequent absence from Kaiserslautern (he had been turning his wealth
into movable property on the quiet) and his suspicious-looking, snivellingly
sullen appearance.<sup class="enote"><a href="#169">[169]</a></sup> At the same
time an old acquaintance of mine, <span class="context">[Victor
Schily.–Ed.]</span> a captain in the Rhenish Hessian corps, stood up and
declared that if I were to be arrested, he, together with a considerable number
of the best men in the corps, would leave it at once. Moll and others were for
defending me there and then with force. Those present split into two parties,
the scene promised to become interesting and I declared I would naturally allow
myself to be arrested with pleasure: it would finally be clear for all to see
what the colour of the Palatinate movement was. I went with the guard.</p>
<p>The next morning, after a comical interrogation which Herr Zitz put me
through, I was handed over to the civil commissary and by him to a gendarme.
The gendarme, on whom it had been impressed to treat me as a <i>spy,</i>
handcuffed me and led me on foot to Kaiserslautern, accused of disparaging the
uprising of the Palatinate people and inciting against the government, which,
by the way, I had not mentioned. On the way I succeeded in getting a carriage.
In Kaiserslautern, where Moll had hurried on ahead of me, I found the
government highly bewildered at the valiant Greiner's <i>bevue</i> and even
more bewildered at the treatment meted out to me. Needless to say I carried on
quite a bit at the gentlemen in the presence of the gendarme. Since no report
from Herr Greiner had yet arrived, I was offered freedom on parole. I refused
to give my parole and went into the cantonal gaol–without an escort,
which condition was agreed to at d'Ester's request. D'Ester declared that he
could stay no longer after such treatment had been meted out to a party
comrade. Tzschirner, who arrived just at that time, also took a very resolute
stand. The same evening the news spread throughout the town and everyone who
belonged to the resolute trend immediately sided with me. On top of that, news
arrived that disturbances had broken out in the Rhenish Hessian corps on
account of this affair and that a large part of the corps intended to disband.
It would have taken less than that to demonstrate to the provisional regents,
in whose company I had been daily, the necessity of giving me satisfaction.
After I had spent 24 quite amusing hours in gaol, d'Ester and Schmitt came to
see me; Schmitt explained to me that I was unconditionally free and that the
government hoped that I would not be deterred from continuing to take part in
the movement. Besides this, I was told, the order had been given that in future
no political prisoner was to be brought in handcuffed, and the investigation
against the investigator of this infamous treatment as well as of the arrest
and its cause was proceeding. After the government had taken these steps to
give me all the satisfaction that it could for the moment, since Herr Greiner
had still not sent in a report, the solemn faces on both sides were discarded
and the company had a few drinks together in the Donnersberg. The next day
Tzschirner departed for the Rhenish Hessian corps in order to appease it and I
gave him a short note to take with him. When Herr Greiner returned he made such
a snivelling exhibition of himself that his colleagues gave him a doubly severe
dressing-down.</p>
<p>At the same time the Prussians marched in from Homburg. Since things thus
took an interesting turn, since I had no intention of letting slip the
opportunity of gaining some military education, and lastly since the <i>Neue
Rheinische Zeitung</i> also had to be represented <i>honoris causa</i> in
the army of Baden and the Palatinate, I too buckled on a broadsword and went
off to join Willich.</p>

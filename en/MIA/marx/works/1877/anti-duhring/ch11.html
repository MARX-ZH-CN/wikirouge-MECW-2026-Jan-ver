<h3>XIII. Dialectics.<br>
Negation of the Negation</h3>
<a id="479"></a>
<p class="quoted">“This historical sketch” (of the genesis of the
so-called primitive accumulation of capital in England) “is relatively
the best part of Marx's book, and would be even better if it had not relied on
the dialectical crutch to help out its scholarly crutch. The Hegelian negation
of the negation, in default of anything better and clearer, has in fact to
serve here as the midwife to deliver the future from the womb of the past. The
abolition of ‘individual property’, which since the sixteenth
century has been effected in the way indicated above, is the first negation. It
will be followed by a second, which bears the character of a negation of the
negation and hence of a restoration of ‘individual property’, but
in a higher form, based on the common ownership of land and of the instruments
of labour. Herr Marx calls this new ‘individual property’ also
‘social property’, and in this there appears the Hegelian higher
unity, in which the contradiction is supposed to be sublated, that is to say,
in the Hegelian verbal jugglery, both overcome and preserved... According to
this, the expropriation of the expropriators is, as it were, the automatic
result of historical reality in its materially external relations... It would
be difficult to convince a sensible man of the necessity of the common
ownership of land and capital, on the basis of credence in Hegelian
wordjuggling such as the negation of the negation {D. K. G. 502-03}... The
nebulous hybrids of Marx’s conceptions will not however appear strange to
anyone who realises what nonsense can be concocted with Hegelian dialectics as
the scientific basis, or rather what nonsense must necessarily spring from it.
For the benefit of the reader who is not familiar with these artifices, it must
be pointed out expressly that Hegel’s first negation is the catechismal
idea of the fall from grace and his second is that of a higher unity leading to
redemption. The logic of facts can hardly be based on this nonsensical analogy
borrowed from the religious sphere {504} ... Herr Marx remains cheerfully in
the nebulous world of his property which is at once both individual and social
and leaves it to his adepts to solve for themselves this profound dialectical
enigma” {505}</p>
<a id="480"></a>
<p class="fst">Thus far Herr Dühring.</p>
<a id="481"></a>
<p>So Marx has no other way of proving the necessity of the social revolution,
of establishing the common ownership of land and of the means of production
produced by labour, except by citing the Hegelian negation of the negation; and
because he bases his socialist theory on these nonsensical analogies borrowed
from religion, he arrives at the result that in the society of the future there
will be dominant an ownership at once both individual and social, as Hegelian
higher unity of the sublated contradiction.</p>
<a id="482"></a>
<p>But let the negation of the negation rest for the moment and let us have a
look at the <span class="duhring">“ownership”</span> which is <span class="duhring">“at once both individual and social”</span>. Herr
Dühring characterises this as a <span class="duhring">“nebulous
world”</span>, and curiously enough he is really right on this point.
Unfortunately, however, it is not Marx but again Herr Dühring himself who is in
this nebulous world. Just as his dexterity in handling the Hegelian method of
<span class="duhring">“delirious raving”</span> {D. Ph. 227, 449}
enabled him without any difficulty to determine what the still unfinished
volumes of <i>Capital</i> are sure to contain, so here, too, without any
great effort he can put Marx right <i>à la</i> Hegel, by imputing to him the
higher unity of a property, of which there is not a word in Marx.</p>
<a id="483"></a>
<p>Marx says: “It is the negation of negation. This re-establishes
individual property, but on the basis of the acquisitions of the capitalist
era, i.e., on co-operation of free workers and their possession in common of
the land and of the means of production produced by labour. The transformation
of scattered private property, arising from individual labour, into capitalist
private property is, naturally, a process, incomparably more protracted,
arduous, and difficult, than the transformation of capitalistic private
property, already practically resting on socialised production, into socialised
property.” [K. Marx, <i>Das Kapital</i>, p. 793.] <span class="context">[Capital, volume I, Chapter 33, page 384 in the MIA pdf
file.]</span> That is all. The state of things brought about by the
expropriation of the expropriators is therefore characterised as the
re-establishment of individual property, but <i>on the basis</i> of the
social ownership of the land and of the means of production produced by labour
itself. To anyone who understands plain talk this means that social ownership
extends to the land and the other means of production, and individual ownership
to the products, that is, the articles of consumption. And in order to make the
matter comprehensible even to children of six, Marx assumes on page 56 <span class="context">[Chapter 1, page 48 in the MIA pdf]</span> “a community
of free individuals, carrying on their work with the means of production in
common, in which the labour-power of all the different individuals is
consciously applied as the combined labour-power of the community”, that
is, a society organised on a socialist basis; and he continues: “The
total product of our community is a social product. One portion serves as fresh
means of production and <i>remains social.</i> But another portion is
consumed by the members as means of subsistence. A <i>distribution of this
portion amongst them is consequently necessary</i>.” And surely that is
clear enough even for Herr Dühring, in spite of his having Hegel on his
brain.</p>
<a id="484"></a>
<p>The property which is at once both individual and social, this confusing
hybrid, this nonsense which necessarily springs from Hegelian dialectics, this
nebulous world, this profound dialectical enigma, which Marx leaves his adepts
to solve for themselves — is yet another free creation and imagination on
the part of Herr Dühring. Marx, as an alleged Hegelian, is obliged to produce a
real higher unity, as the outcome of the negation of the negation, and as Marx
does not do this to Herr Dühring's taste, the latter has to fall again into his
higher and nobler style, and in the interests of complete truth impute to Marx
things which are the products of Herr Dühring's own manufacture. A man who is
totally incapable of quoting correctly, even by way of exception, may well
become morally indignant at the <span class="duhring">“Chinese
erudition”</span> {D. K. G. 506} of other people, who always quote
correctly, but precisely by doing this <span class="duhring">“inadequately conceal their lack of insight into the
totality of ideas of the various writers from whom they quote”</span>.
Herr Dühring is right. Long live historical depiction in the grand style
{556}!</p>
<a id="485"></a>
<p>Up to this point we have proceeded from the assumption that Herr Dühring's
persistent habit of misquoting is done at least in good faith, and arises
either from his total incapacity to understand things or from a habit of
quoting from memory — a habit which seems to be peculiar to historical
depiction in the grand style, but is usually described as slovenly. But we seem
to have reached the point at which, even with Herr Dühring, quantity is
transformed into quality. For we must take into consideration in the first
place that the passage in Marx is in itself perfectly clear and is moreover
amplified in the same book by a further passage which leaves no room whatever
for misunderstanding; secondly, that Herr Dühring had discovered the
monstrosity of <span class="duhring">“property which is at once both
individual and social”</span> {505} neither in the critique of
<i>Capital</i>, in the <i>Ergänzungsblätter</i> which was referred to
above, nor even in the critique contained in the first edition of his
<i>Kritische Geschichte</i>, but only in the second edition — that is,
on the <i>third</i> reading of <i>Capital;</i> further, that in this second
edition, which was rewritten in a socialist sense, it was deemed necessary by
Herr Dühring to make Marx say the utmost possible nonsense about the future
organisation of society, in order to enable him, in contrast, to bring forward
all the more triumphantly — as he in fact does — “the
economic commune as described by <i>me</i> in economic and juridical outline
in my <i>Cursus”</i> {504} — when we take all this into
consideration, we are almost forced to the conclusion that Herr Dühring has
here deliberately made a “beneficent extension” of Marx's idea
— beneficent for Herr Dühring.</p>
<a id="486"></a>
<p>But what role does the negation of the negation play in Marx? On page 791
and the following pages he sets out the final conclusions which he draws from
the preceding fifty pages of economic and historical investigation into the
so-called primitive accumulation of capital. <a href="footnotes.html#n62" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[62]</sup></a> Before the capitalist era, petty industry existed,
at least in England, on the basis of the private property of the labourer in
his means of production. The so-called primitive accumulation of capital
consisted there in the expropriation of these immediate producers, that is, in
the dissolution of private property based on the labour of its owner. This
became possible because the petty industry referred to above is compatible only
with narrow and primitive bounds of production and society and at a certain
stage brings forth the material agencies for its own annihilation. This
annihilation, the transformation of the individual and scattered means of
production into socially concentrated ones, forms the prehistory of capital. As
soon as the labourers are turned into proletarians, their conditions of labour
into capital, as soon as the capitalist mode of production stands on its own
feet, the further socialisation of labour and further transformation of the
land and other means of production, and therefore the further expropriation of
private proprietors, takes a new form.</p>
<p class="quoteb">“That which is now to be expropriated is no longer the
labourer working for himself, but the capitalist exploiting many labourers.
This expropriation is accomplished by the action of the immanent laws of
capitalistic production itself, by the concentration of capitals. One
capitalist always kills many. Hand in hand with this concentration, or this
expropriation of many capitalists by few, develop, on an ever extending scale,
the co-operative form of the labour-process, the conscious technical
application of science, the methodical collective cultivation of the soil, the
transformation of the instruments of labour into instruments of labour only
usable in common, the economising of all means of production by their use as
the jointly owned means of production of combined, socialised labour. Along
with the constantly diminishing number of the magnates of capital, who usurp
and monopolise all advantages of this process of transformation, grows the mass
of misery, oppression, slavery, degradation, exploitation; but with this too
grows the revolt of the working class, a class always increasing in numbers,
and disciplined, united, organised by the very mechanism of the process of
capitalist production itself. Capital becomes a fetter upon the mode of
production, which has sprung up and flourished along with, and under it.
Concentration of the means of production and socialisation of labour at last
reach a point where they become incompatible with their capitalist integument.
This integument is burst asunder. The knell of capitalist private property
sounds. The expropriators are expropriated.”</p>
<a id="487"></a>
<p>And now I ask the reader: where are the dialectical frills and mazes and
conceptual arabesques; where the mixed and misconceived ideas according to
which everything is all one and the same thing in the end; where the
dialectical miracles for his faithful followers; where the mysterious
dialectical rubbish and the maze in accordance with the Hegelian Logos
doctrine, without which Marx, according to Herr Dühring, is unable to put his
exposition into shape? Marx merely shows from history, and here states in a
summarised form, that just as formerly petty industry by its very development
necessarily created the conditions of its own annihilation, i.e., of the
expropriation of the small proprietors, so now the capitalist mode of
production has likewise itself created the material conditions from which it
must perish. The process is a historical one, and if it is at the same time a
dialectical process, this is not Marx's fault, however annoying it may be to
Herr Dühring.</p>
<a id="488"></a>
<p>It is only at this point, after Marx has completed his proof on the basis of
historical and economic facts, that he proceeds:</p>
<p class="quoteb">“The capitalist mode of production and appropriation,
hence the capitalist private property, is the first negation of individual
private property founded on the labour of the proprietor. Capitalist production
begets, with the inexorability of a process of nature, its own negation. It is
the negation of the negation” — and so on (as quoted above).</p>
<a id="489"></a>
<p>Thus, by characterising the process as the negation of the negation, Marx
does not intend to prove that the process was historically necessary. On the
contrary: only after he has proved from history that in fact the process has
partially already occurred, and partially must occur in the future, he in
addition characterises it as a process which develops in accordance with a
definite dialectical law. That is all. It is therefore once again a pure
distortion of the facts by Herr Dühring when he declares that the negation of
the negation has to serve here as the midwife to deliver the future from the
womb of the past {D. K. G. 502-03}, or that Marx wants anyone to be convinced
of the necessity of the common ownership of land and capital {503} (which is
itself a Dühringian contradiction in corporeal form) on the basis of credence
in the negation of the negation {479-80}.</p>
<a id="490"></a>
<p>Herr Dühring's total lack of understanding of the nature of dialectics is
shown by the very fact that he regards it as a mere proof-producing instrument,
as a limited mind might look upon formal logic or elementary mathematics. Even
formal logic is primarily a method of arriving at new results, of advancing
from the known to the unknown — and dialectics is the same, only much
more eminently so; moreover, since it forces its way beyond the narrow horizon
of formal logic, it contains the germ of a more comprehensive view of the
world. The same correlation exists in mathematics. Elementary mathematics, the
mathematics of constant quantities, moves within the confines of formal logic,
at any rate on the whole; the mathematics of variables, whose most important
part is the infinitesimal calculus, is in essence nothing other than the
application of dialectics to mathematical relations. In it, the simple question
of proof is definitely pushed into the background, as compared with the
manifold application of the method to new spheres of research. But almost all
the proofs of higher mathematics, from the first proofs of the differential
calculus on, are from the standpoint of elementary mathematics strictly
speaking, wrong. And this is necessarily so, when, as happens in this case, an
attempt is made to prove by formal logic results obtained in the field of
dialectics. To attempt to prove anything by means of dialectics alone to a
crass metaphysician like Herr Dühring would be as much a waste of time as was
the attempt made by Leibniz and his pupils to prove the principles of the
infinitesimal calculus to the mathematicians of their time. The differential
gave them the same cramps as Herr Dühring gets from the negation of the
negation, in which, moreover, as we shall see, the differential also plays a
certain role. Finally these gentlemen — or those of them who had not died
in the interval — grudgingly gave way, not because they were convinced,
but because it always came out right. Herr Dühring, as he himself tells us, is
only in his forties, and if he attains old age, as we hope he may, perhaps his
experience will be the same.</p>
<a id="491"></a>
<p>But what then is this fearful negation of the negation, which makes life so
bitter for Herr Dühring and with him plays the same role of the unpardonable
crime as the sin against the Holy Ghost does in Christianity? — A very
simple process which is taking place everywhere and every day, which any child
can understand as soon as it is stripped of the veil of mystery in which it was
enveloped by the old idealist philosophy and in which it is to the advantage of
helpless metaphysicians of Herr Dühring’s calibre to keep it enveloped.
Let us take a grain of barley. Billions of such grains of barley are milled,
boiled and brewed and then consumed. But if such a grain of barley meets with
conditions which are normal for it, if it falls on suitable soil, then under
the influence of heat and moisture it undergoes a specific change, it
germinates; the grain as such ceases to exist, it is negated, and in its place
appears the plant which has arisen from it, the negation of the grain. But what
is the normal life-process of this plant? It grows, flowers, is fertilised and
finally once more produces grains of barley, and as soon as these have ripened
the stalk dies, is in its turn negated. As a result of this negation of the
negation we have once again the original grain of barley, but not as a single
unit, but ten-, twenty- or thirtyfold. Species of grain change extremely
slowly, and so the barley of today is almost the same as it was a century ago.
But if we take a plastic ornamental plant, for example a dahlia or an orchid,
and treat the seed and the plant which grows from it according to the
gardener’s art, we get as a result of this negation of the negation not
only more seeds, but also qualitatively improved seeds, which produce more
beautiful flowers, and each repetition of this process, each fresh negation of
the negation, enhances this process of perfection. — With most insects,
this process follows the same lines as in the case of the grain of barley.
Butterflies, for example, spring from the egg by a negation of the egg, pass
through certain transformations until they reach sexual maturity, pair and are
in turn negated, dying as soon as the pairing process has been completed and
the female has laid its numerous eggs. We are not concerned at the moment with
the fact that with other plants and animals the process does not take such a
simple form, that before they die they produce seeds, eggs or offspring not
once but many times; our purpose here is only to show that the negation of the
negation <i>really does take place</i> in both kingdoms of the organic world.
Furthermore, the whole of geology is a series of negated negations, a series of
successive chatterings of old and deposits of new rock formations. First the
original earth crust brought into existence by the cooling of the liquid mass
was broken up by oceanic, meteorological and atmospherico-chemical action, and
these fragmented masses were stratified on the ocean bed. Local upheavals of
the ocean bed above the surface of the sea subject portions of these first
strata once more to the action of rain, the changing temperature of the seasons
and the oxygen and carbonic acid of the atmosphere. These same influences act
on the molten masses of rock which issue from the interior of the earth, break
through the strata and subsequently cool off. In this way, in the course of
millions of centuries, ever new strata are formed and in turn are for the most
part destroyed, ever anew serving as material for the formation of new strata.
But the result of this process has been a very positive one: the creation of a
soil composed of the most varied chemical elements and mechanically fragmented,
which makes possible the most abundant and diversified vegetation.</p>
<a id="492"></a>
<p>It is the same in mathematics. Let us take any algebraic quantity whatever:
for example, a. If this is negated, we get -a (minus <i>a).</i> If we negate
that negation, by multiplying -<i>a</i> by -<i>a</i>, we get
+a<sup>2</sup>, i.e., the original positive quantity, but at a higher degree,
raised to its second power. In this case also it makes no difference that we
can obtain the same a<sup>2</sup> by multiplying the positive <i>a</i> by
itself, thus likewise getting a<sup>2</sup>. For the negated negation is so
securely entrenched in a<sup>2</sup> that the latter always has two square
roots, namely, <i>a</i> and — <i>a.</i> And the fact that it is
impossible to get rid of the negated negation, the negative root of the square,
acquires very obvious significance as soon as we come to quadratic equations.
— The negation of the negation is even more strikingly obvious in higher
analysis, in those “summations of indefinitely small magnitudes”
{D. Ph. 418} which Herr Dühring himself declares are the highest operations of
mathematics, and in ordinary language are known as the differential and
integral calculus. How are these forms of calculus used? In a given problem,
for example, I have two variables,<i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, neither of which
can vary without the other also varying in a ratio determined by the facts of
the case. I differentiate <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, i.e., I take <i>x</i>
and <i>y</i> as so infinitely small that in comparison with any real
quantity, however small, they disappear, that nothing is left of <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i> but their reciprocal relation without any, so to speak, material
basis, a quantitative ratio in which there is no quantity. Therefore,
<i>dy</i>/<i>dx</i>, the ratio between the differentials of <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i>, is <i>dx</i> equal to 0/0 but 0/0 taken as the expression of
<i>y</i>/<i>x</i>. I only mention in passing that this ratio between two
quantities which have disappeared, caught at the moment of their disappearance,
is a contradiction; however, it cannot disturb us any more than it has
disturbed the whole of mathematics for almost two hundred years. And now, what
have I done but negate<i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, though not in such a way that
I need not bother about them any more, not in the way that metaphysics negates,
but in the way that corresponds with the facts of the case? In place
of<i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, therefore, I have their negation, <i>dx</i> and
<i>dy</i>, in the formulas or equations before me. I continue then to operate
with these formulas, treating <i>dx</i> and <i>dy</i> as quantities which
are real, though subject to certain exceptional laws, and at a certain point I
<i>negate the negation</i>, i.e., I integrate the differential formula, and
in place of <i>dx</i> and <i>dy</i> again get the real quantities
<i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, and am then not where I was at the beginning, but by
using this method I have solved the problem on which ordinary geometry and
algebra might perhaps have broken their jaws in vain.</p>
<a id="493"></a>
<p>It is the same in history, as well. All civilised peoples begin with the
common ownership of the land. With all peoples who have passed a certain
primitive stage, this common ownership becomes in the course of the development
of agriculture a fetter on production. It is abolished, negated, and after a
longer or shorter series of intermediate stages is transformed into private
property. But at a higher stage of agricultural development, brought about by
private property in land itself, private property conversely becomes a fetter
on production, as is the case today both with small and large landownership.
The demand that it, too, should be negated, that it should once again be
transformed into common property, necessarily arises. But this demand does not
mean the restoration of the aboriginal common ownership, but the institution of
a far higher and more developed form of possession in common which, far from
being a hindrance to production, on the contrary for the first time will free
production from all fetters and enable it to make full use of modern chemical
discoveries and mechanical inventions.</p>
<a id="494"></a>
<p>Or let us take another example: The philosophy of antiquity was primitive,
spontaneously evolved materialism. As such, it was incapable of clearing up the
relation between mind and matter. But the need to get clarity on this question
led to the doctrine of a soul separable from the body, then to the assertion of
the immortality of this soul, and finally to monotheism. The old materialism
was therefore negated by idealism. But in the course of the further development
of philosophy, idealism, too, became untenable and was negated by modern
materialism. This modern materialism, the negation of the negation, is not the
mere re-establishment of the old, but adds to the permanent foundations of this
old materialism the whole thought-content of two thousand years of development
of philosophy and natural science, as well as of the history of these two
thousand years. It is no longer a philosophy at all, but simply a world outlook
which has to establish its validity and be applied not in a science of sciences
standing apart, but in the real sciences. Philosophy is therefore “sublated”
here, that is, “both overcome and preserved” {D. K. G. 503}; overcome as
regards its form, and preserved as regards its real content. Thus, where Herr
Dühring sees only <span class="duhring">“verbal jugglery”</span>, closer
inspection reveals an actual content.</p>
<a id="495"></a>
<p>Finally: Even the Rousseau doctrine of equality — of which Dühring's
is only a feeble and distorted echo — could not have seen the light but
for the midwife’s services rendered by the Hegelian negation of the negation
{502-03} — though it was nearly twenty years before Hegel was born. <a href="footnotes.html#n63" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[63]</sup></a> And far from being
ashamed of this, the doctrine in its first presentation bears almost
ostentatiously the imprint of its dialectical origin. In the state of nature
and savagery men were equal; and as Rousseau regards even language as a
perversion of the state of nature, he is fully justified in extending the
equality of animals within the limits of a single species also to the
animal-men recently classified by Haeckel hypothetically as <i>Alali</i>:
speechless. But these equal animal-men had one quality which gave them an
advantage over the other animals: perfectibility, the capacity to develop
further; and this became the cause of inequality. So Rousseau regards the rise
of inequality as progress. But this progress contained an antagonism: it was at
the same time retrogression.</p>
<a id="496"></a>
<p class="quoted">“All further progress” (beyond the original state) “meant so
many steps seemingly towards the <i>perfection of the individual man</i>, but
in reality towards the <i>decay of the race...</i> Metallurgy and agriculture
were the two arts the discovery of which produced this great revolution” (the
transformation of the primeval forest into cultivated land, but along with this
the introduction of poverty and slavery through property). “For the poet it is
gold and silver, but for the philosopher iron and corn, which have civilised
<i>men</i> and ruined the human race.”</p>
<a id="497"></a>
<p class="fst">Each new advance of civilisation is at the same time a new
advance of inequality. All institutions set up by the society which has arisen
with civilisation change into the opposite of their original purpose.</p>
<a id="498"></a>
<p class="quoted">“It is an incontestable fact, and the fundamental principle
of all public law, that the peoples set up their chieftains to safeguard their
liberty and not to enslave them.”</p>
<a id="499"></a>
<p class="fst">And nevertheless the chiefs necessarily become the oppressors of
the peoples, and intensify their oppression up to the point at which
inequality, carried to the utmost extreme, again changes into its opposite,
becomes the cause of equality: before the despot all are equal — equally
ciphers.</p>
<a id="500"></a>
<p class="quoted">“Here we have the extreme measure of inequality, <i>the
final point which completes the circle and meets the point from which we set
out:</i> here all private individuals become equal once more, just because
they are ciphers, and the subjects have no other law but their master's will.”
But the despot is only master so long as he is able to use force and therefore
“when he is driven out”, he cannot “complain of the use of force... Force alone
maintained him in power, and force alone overthrows him; thus everything takes
its natural course”.</p>
<a id="501"></a>
<p class="fst">And so inequality once more changes into equality; not, however,
into the former naive equality of speechless primitive men, but into the higher
equality of the social contract. The oppressors are oppressed. It is the
negation of the negation.</p>
<a id="502"></a>
<p>Already in Rousseau, therefore, we find not only a line of thought which
corresponds exactly to the one developed in Marx’s <i>Capital</i>, but also,
in details, a whole series of the same dialectical turns of speech as Marx
used: processes which in their nature are antagonistic, contain a
contradiction; transformation of one extreme into its opposite; and finally, as
the kernel of the whole thing, the negation of the negation. And though in 1754
Rousseau was not yet able to speak the Hegelian jargon {D. K. G. 491}, he was
certainly, sixteen years before Hegel was born, deeply bitten with the Hegelian
pestilence, dialectics of contradiction, Logos doctrine, theologies, and so
forth. And when Herr Dühring, in his shallow version of Rousseau’s theory of
equality, begins to operate with his victorious two men, he is himself already
on the inclined plane down which he must slide helplessly into the arms of the
negation of the negation. The state of things in which the equality of the two
men flourished, which was also described as an ideal one, is characterised on
page 271 of his <i>Philosophie</i> as the “primitive state”. This primitive
state, however, according to page 279, was necessarily sublated by the “robber
system” — the first negation. But now, thanks to the philosophy of
reality, we have gone so far as to abolish the robber system and establish in
its stead the economic commune {504} based on equality which has been
discovered by Herr Dühring — negation of the negation, equality on a
higher plane. What a delightful spectacle, and how beneficently it extends our
range of vision: Herr Dühring's eminent self committing the capital crime of
the negation of the negation!</p>
<a id="503"></a>
<p>And so, what is the negation of the negation? An extremely general —
and for this reason extremely far-reaching and important — law of
development of nature, history, and thought; a law which, as we have seen,
holds good in the animal and plant kingdoms, in geology, in mathematics, in
history and in philosophy — a law which even Herr Dühring, in spite of
all his stubborn resistance, has unwittingly and in his own way to follow. It
is obvious that I do not say anything concerning the <i>particular</i>
process of development of, for example, a grain of barley from germination to
the death of the fruit-bearing plant, if I say it is a negation of the
negation. For, as the integral calculus is also a negation of the negation, if
I said anything of the sort I should only be making the nonsensical statement
that the life-process of a barley plant was integral calculus or for that
matter that it was socialism. That, however, is precisely what the
metaphysicians are constantly imputing to dialectics. When I say that all these
processes are a negation of the negation, I bring them all together under this
one law of motion, and for this very reason I leave out of account the specific
peculiarities of each individual process. Dialectics, however, is nothing more
than the science of the general laws of motion and development of nature, human
society and thought.</p>

<p>But someone may object: the negation that has taken place in this case is
not a real negation: I negate a grain of barley also when I grind it, an insect
when I crush it underfoot, or the positive quantity <i>a</i> when I cancel
it, and so on. Or I negate the sentence: the rose is a rose, when I say: the
rose is not a rose; and what do I get if I then negate this negation and say:
but after all the rose is a rose? — These objections are in fact the
chief arguments put forward by the metaphysicians against dialectics, and they
are wholly worthy of the narrow-mindedness of this mode of thought. Negation in
dialectics does not mean simply saying no, or declaring that something does not
exist, or destroying it in any way one likes. Long ago Spinoza said: <i>Omnis
determinatio est negatio</i> — every limitation or determination is at
the same time a negation. <a href="footnotes.html#n64" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[64]</sup></a> And further: the kind of negation is here
determined, firstly, by the general and, secondly, by the particular nature of
the process. I must not only negate, but also sublate the negation. I must
therefore so arrange the first negation that the second remains or becomes
possible. How? This depends on the particular nature of each individual case.
If I grind a grain of barley, or crush an insect, I have carried out the first
part of the action, but have made the second part impossible. Every kind of
thing therefore has a peculiar way of being negated in such manner that it
gives rise to a development, and it is just the same with every kind of
conception or idea. The infinitesimal calculus involves a form of negation
which is different from that used in the formation of positive powers from
negative roots. This has to be learnt, like everything else. The bare knowledge
that the barley plant and the infinitesimal calculus are both governed by
negation of negation does not enable me either to grow barley successfully or
to differentiate and integrate; just as little as the bare knowledge of the
laws of the determination of sound by the dimensions of the strings enables me
to play the violin. — But it is clear that from a negation of the
negation which consists in the childish pastime of alternately writing and
cancelling <i>a</i>, or in alternately declaring that a rose is a rose and
that it is not a rose, nothing eventuates but the silliness of the person who
adopts such a tedious procedure. And yet the metaphysicians try to make us
believe that this is the right way to carry out a negation of the negation, if
we ever should want to do such a thing.</p>

<p>Once again, therefore, it is no one but Herr Dühring who is mystifying us
when he asserts that the negation of the negation is a stupid analogy invented
by Hegel, borrowed from the sphere of religion and based on the story of the
fall of man and his redemption {D. K. G. 504}. Men thought dialectically long
before they knew what dialectics was, just as they spoke prose long before the
term prose existed. <span class="context">[An allusion to Molière's comedy <i>Le Bourgeois
gentilhomme</i>, Act II, Scene 6 — <i>Ed</i>.]</span> The law of negation of
the negation, which is unconsciously operative in nature and history and, until
it has been recognised, also in our heads, was only first clearly formulated by
Hegel. And if Herr Dühring wants to operate with it himself on the quiet and it
is only that he cannot stand the name, then let him find a better name. But if
his aim is to banish the process itself from thought, we must ask him to be so
good as first to banish it from nature and history and to invent a mathematical
system in which -<i>a x -a is</i> not +<i>a</i><sup>2</sup> and in which
differentiation and integration are prohibited under severe penalties.</p>

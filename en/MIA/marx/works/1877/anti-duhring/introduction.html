<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h3>General</h3>
<a id="013"></a>
<p class="fst">Modern socialism is, in its essence, the direct product of the
recognition, on the one hand, of the class antagonisms existing in the society
of today between proprietors and non-proprietors, between capitalists and
wage-workers; on the other hand, of the anarchy existing in production. But, in
its theoretical form, modern socialism originally appears ostensibly as a more
logical extension of the principles laid down by the great French philosophers
of the eighteenth century. Like every new theory, modern socialism had, at
first, to connect itself with the intellectual stock-in-trade ready to its
hand, however deeply its roots lay in economic facts.<a id="014"></a></p>
<p>The great men, who in France prepared men’s minds for the coming
revolution, were themselves extreme revolutionists. They recognised no external
authority of any kind whatever. Religion, natural science, society, political
institutions — everything was subjected to the most unsparing criticism;
everything must justify its existence before the judgment-seat of reason or
give up existence. Reason became the sole measure of everything. It was the
time when, as Hegel says, the world stood upon its head; first in the sense
that the human head, and the principles arrived at by its thought, claimed to
be the basis of all human action and association; but by and by, also, in the
wider sense that the reality which was in contradiction to these principles
had, in fact, to be turned upside down. Every form of society and government
then existing, every old traditional notion was flung into the lumber room as
irrational; the world had hitherto allowed itself to be led solely by
prejudices; everything in the past deserved only pity and contempt. Now, for
the first time, appeared the light of day, henceforth superstition, injustice,
privilege, oppression, were to be superseded by eternal truth, eternal Right,
equality based on nature and the inalienable rights of man.<a id="015"></a></p>
<p>We know today that this kingdom of reason was nothing more than the
idealised kingdom of the bourgeoisie; that this eternal Right found its
realisation in bourgeois justice; that this equality reduced itself to
bourgeois equality before the law; that bourgeois property was proclaimed as
one of the essential rights of man; and that the government of reason, the
Contrat Social of Rousseau, <a href="footnotes.html#n21" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[21]</sup></a> came into being, and only could come into being,
as a democratic bourgeois republic. The great thinkers of the eighteenth
century could, no more than their predecessors, go beyond the limits imposed
upon them by their epoch.<a id="016"></a></p>
<p>But, side by side with the antagonism of the feudal nobility and the
burghers, was the general antagonism of exploiters and exploited, of rich
idlers and poor workers. It was this very circumstance that made it possible
for the representatives of the bourgeoisie to put themselves forward as
representing not one special class, but the whole of suffering humanity. Still
further. From its origin the bourgeoisie was saddled with its antithesis:
capitalists cannot exist without wage-workers, and, in the same proportion as
the mediaeval burgher of the guild developed into the modern bourgeois, the
guild journeyman and the day-labourer, outside the guilds, developed into the
proletarian. And although, upon the whole, the bourgeoisie, in their struggle
with the nobility, could claim to represent at the same time the interests of
the different working classes of that period, yet in every great bourgeois
movement there were independent outbursts of that class which was the
forerunner, more or less developed, of the modern proletariat. For example, at
the time of the German Reformation and the Peasant War, Thomas Münzer; in the
great English Revolution, the Levellers <a href="footnotes.html#n22" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[22]</sup></a>; in the great French Revolution, Babeuf. There
were theoretical enunciations corresponding with these revolutionary uprisings
of a class not yet developed; in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
utopian pictures of ideal social conditions <a href="footnotes.html#n23" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[23]</sup></a>; in the eighteenth, actual communistic theories
(Morelly and Mably). The demand for equality was no longer limited to political
rights; it was extended also to the social conditions of individuals. It was
not simply class privileges that were to be abolished, but class distinctions
themselves. A communism, ascetic, Spartan, was the first form of the new
teaching. Then came the three great utopians: Saint-Simon, to whom the
middle-class movement, side by side with the proletarian, still had a certain
significance; Fourier, and Owen, who in the country where capitalist production
was most developed, and under the influence of the antagonisms begotten of
this, worked out his proposals for the removal of class distinctions
systematically and in direct relation to French materialism.</p>
<a id="017"></a>
<p>One thing is common to all three. Not one of them appears as a
representative of the interests of that proletariat which historical
development had, in the meantime, produced. Like the French philosophers, they
do not claim to emancipate a particular class, but all humanity. Like them,
they wish to bring in the kingdom of reason and eternal justice, but this
kingdom, as they see it, is as far as heaven from earth, from that of the
French philosophers.</p>
<a id="018"></a>
<p>For the bourgeois world, based upon the principles of these philosophers, is
quite as irrational and unjust, and, therefore, finds its way to the dust-hole
quite as readily as feudalism and all the earlier stages of society. If pure
reason and justice have not, hitherto, ruled the world, this has been the case
only because men have not rightly understood them. What was wanted was the
individual man of genius, who has now arisen and who understands the truth.
That he has now arisen, that the truth has now been clearly understood, is not
an inevitable event, following of necessity in the chain of historical
development, but a mere happy accident. He might just as well have been born
500 years earlier, and might then have spared humanity 500 years of error,
strife, and suffering.</p>
<a id="019"></a>
<p>This mode of outlook is essentially that of all English and French and of
the first German socialists, including Weitling. Socialism is the expression of
absolute truth, reason and justice and has only to be discovered to conquer all
the world by virtue of its own power. And as absolute truth is independent of
time, space, and of the historical development of man, it is a mere accident
when and where it is discovered. With all this, absolute truth, reason, and
justice are different with the founder of each different school. And as each
one”s special kind of absolute truth, reason, and justice is again conditioned
by his subjective understanding, his conditions of existence, the measure of
his knowledge and his intellectual training, there is no other ending possible
in this conflict of absolute truths than that they shall be mutually exclusive
one of the other. Hence, from this nothing could come but a kind of eclectic,
average socialism, which, as a matter of fact, has up to the present time
dominated the minds of most of the socialist workers in France and England.
Hence, a mish-mash allowing of the most manifold shades of opinion; a mish-mash
of less striking critical statements, economic theories pictures of future
society by the founders of different sects, a mish-mash which is the more
easily brewed the more the definite sharp edges of the individual constituents
are rubbed down in the stream of debate, like rounded pebbles in a brook.</p>
<a id="020"></a>
<p>To make a science of socialism, it had first to be placed upon a real
basis.</p>
<a id="021"></a>
<p>In the meantime, along with and after the French philosophy of the
eighteenth century had arisen the new German philosophy, culminating in Hegel.
Its greatest merit was the taking up again of dialectics as the highest form of
reasoning. The old Greek philosophers were all born natural dialecticians, and
Aristotle, the most encyclopaedic intellect of them, had already analysed the
most essential forms of dialectic thought. The newer philosophy on the other
hand, although in it also dialectics had brilliant exponents (e.g., Descartes
and Spinoza), had, especially through English influence, become more and more
rigidly fixed in the so-called metaphysical mode of reasoning, by which also
the French of the eighteenth century were almost wholly dominated at all events
in their special philosophical work. Outside philosophy in the restricted
sense, the French nevertheless produced masterpieces of dialectic. We need only
call to mind Diderot’s <i>Le neveu de Rameau</i> <a href="footnotes.html#n24" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[24]</sup></a> and Rousseau's
<i>Discours sur l'origine et les fondemens de l'inégalité parmi les
hommes.</i> We give here, in brief, the essential character of these two modes
of thought. We shall have to return to them later in greater detail.</p>
<a id="022"></a>
<p>When we consider and reflect upon nature at large or the history of mankind
or our own intellectual activity, at first we see the picture of an endless
entanglement of relations and reactions in which nothing remains what, where
and as it was, but everything moves, changes, comes into being and passes away.
This primitive, naive but intrinsically correct conception of the world is that
of ancient Greek philosophy, and was first clearly formulated by Heraclitus:
everything is and is not, for everything <i>is fluid</i>, <i>is</i>
constantly changing, constantly coming into being and passing away.</p>
<a id="023"></a>
<p>But this conception, correctly as it expresses the general character of the
picture of appearances as a whole, does not suffice to explain the details of
which this picture is made up, and so long as we do not understand these, we
have not a clear idea of the whole picture. In order to understand these
details we must detach them from their natural or historical connection and
examine each one separately, its nature, special causes, effects, etc. This is,
primarily, the task of natural science and historical research: branches of
science which the Greeks of classical times on very good grounds, relegated to
a subordinate position, because they had first of all to collect the material.
The beginnings of the exact natural sciences were first worked out by the
Greeks of the Alexandrian period, <a href="footnotes.html#n25" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[25]</sup></a> and later on, in the Middle Ages, by the Arabs.
Real natural science dates from the second half of the fifteenth century, and
thence onward it has advanced with constantly increasing rapidity. The analysis
of nature into its individual parts, the grouping of the different natural
processes and objects in definite classes, the study of the internal anatomy of
organic bodies in their manifold forms — these were the fundamental
conditions of the gigantic strides in our knowledge of nature that have been
made during the last four hundred years. But this method of work has also left
us as legacy the habit of observing natural objects and processes in isolation,
apart from their connection with the vast whole; of observing them in repose,
not in motion; as constants, not as essentially variables, in their death, not
in their life. And when this way of looking at things was transferred by Bacon
and Locke from natural science to philosophy, it begot the narrow, metaphysical
mode of thought peculiar to the preceding centuries.</p>
<a id="024"></a>
<p>To the metaphysician, things and their mental reflexes, ideas, are isolated,
are to be considered one after the other and apart from each other, are objects
of investigation fixed, rigid, given once for all. He thinks in absolutely
irreconcilable antitheses. “His communication is ‘yea, yea; nay, nay’; for
whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.” [Matthew 5:37. —
<i>Ed.</i>] For him a thing either exists or does not exist; a thing cannot
at the same time be itself and something else. Positive and negative absolutely
exclude one another, cause and effect stand in a rigid antithesis one to the
other.</p>
<a id="025"></a>
<p>At first sight this mode of thinking seems to us very luminous, because it
is that of so-called sound common sense. Only sound common sense, respectable
fellow that he is, in the homely realm of his own four walls, has very
wonderful adventures directly he ventures out into the wide world of research.
And the metaphysical mode of thought, justifiable and even necessary as it is
in a number of domains whose extent varies according to the nature of the
particular object of investigation, sooner or later reaches a limit, beyond
which it becomes one-sided, restricted, abstract, lost in insoluble
contradictions. In the contemplation of individual things it forgets the
connection between them; in the contemplation of their existence, it forgets
the beginning and end of that existence; of their repose, it forgets their
motion. It cannot see the wood for the trees.</p>
<a id="026"></a>
<p>For everyday purposes we know and can say, e.g., whether an animal is alive
or not. But, upon closer inquiry, we find that this is, in many cases, a very
complex question, as the jurists know very well. They have cudgelled their
brains in vain to discover a rational limit beyond which the killing of the
child in its mother's womb is murder. It is just as impossible to determine
absolutely the moment of death, for physiology proves that death is not an
instantaneous momentary phenomenon, but a very protracted process.</p>
<a id="027"></a>
<p>In like manner, every organic being is every moment the same and not the
same, every moment it assimilates matter supplied from without, and gets rid of
other matter; every moment some cells of its body die and others build
themselves anew; in a longer or shorter time the matter of its body is
completely renewed, and is replaced by other atoms of matter, so that every
organic being is always itself, and yet something other than itself.</p>
<a id="028"></a>
<p>Further, we find upon closer investigation that the two poles of an
antithesis positive and negative, e.g., are as inseparable as they are opposed
and that despite all their opposition, they mutually interpenetrate. And we
find, in like manner, that cause and effect are conceptions which only hold
good in their application to individual cases; but as soon as we consider the
individual cases in their general connection with the universe as a whole, they
run into each other, and they become confounded when we contemplate that
universal action and reaction in which causes and effects are eternally
changing places, so that what is effect here and now will be cause there and
then, and vice versa.</p>
<a id="029"></a>
<p>None of these processes and modes of thought enters into the framework of
metaphysical reasoning. Dialectics, on the other hand, comprehends things and
their representations, ideas, in their essential connection, concatenation,
motion, origin, and ending. Such processes as those mentioned above are,
therefore, so many corroborations of its own method of procedure.</p>
<a id="030"></a>
<p>Nature is the proof of dialectics, and it must be said for modern science
that it has furnished this proof with very rich materials increasing daily, and
thus has shown that, in the last resort, nature works dialectically and not
metaphysically. But the naturalists who have learned to think dialectically are
few and far between, and this conflict of the results of discovery with
preconceived modes of thinking explains the endless confusion now reigning in
theoretical natural science, the despair of teachers as well as learners, of
authors and readers alike.</p>
<a id="031"></a>
<p>An exact representation of the universe, of its evolution, of the
development of mankind, and of the reflection of this evolution in the minds of
men, can therefore only be obtained by the methods of dialectics with its
constant regard to the innumerable actions and reactions of life and death, of
progressive or retrogressive changes. And in this spirit the new German
philosophy has worked. Kant began his career by resolving the stable solar
system of Newton and its eternal duration, after the famous initial impulse had
once been given, into the result of a historic process, the formation of the
sun and all the planets out of a rotating nebulous mass. From this he at the
same time drew the conclusion that, given this origin of the solar system, its
future death followed of necessity. His theory half a century later was
established mathematically by Laplace, and half a century after that the
spectroscope proved the existence in space of such incandescent masses of gas
in various stages of condensation. <a href="footnotes.html#n26" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[26]</sup></a></p>
<a id="032"></a>
<p>This new German philosophy culminated in the Hegelian system. In this system
— and herein is its great merit — for the first time the whole
world, natural, historical, intellectual, is represented as a process, i.e., as
in constant motion, change transformation, development; and the attempt is made
to trace out the internal connection that makes a continuous whole of all this
movement and development. From this point of view the history of mankind no
longer appeared as a wild whirl of senseless deeds of violence, all equally
condemnable at the judgment-seat of mature philosophic reason and which are
best forgotten as quickly as possible, but as the process of evolution of man
himself. It was now the task of the intellect to follow the gradual march of
this process through all its devious ways, and to trace out the inner law
running through all its apparently accidental phenomena.</p>
<a id="033"></a>
<p>That Hegel did not solve the problem is here immaterial. His epoch-making
merit was that he propounded the problem. This problem is one that no single
individual will ever be able to solve. Although Hegel was — with
Saint-Simon — the most encyclopaedic mind of his time, yet he was
limited, first, by the necessarily limited extent of his own knowledge and,
second, by the limited extent and depth of the knowledge and conceptions of his
age. To these limits a third must be added. Hegel was an idealist. To him the
thoughts within his brain were not the more or less abstract pictures of actual
things and processes, but, conversely, things and their evolution were only the
realised pictures of the “Idea”, existing somewhere from eternity before the
world was. This way of thinking turned everything upside down, and completely
reversed the actual connection of things in the world. Correctly and
ingeniously as many individual groups of facts were grasped by Hegel, yet, for
the reasons just given, there is much that is botched, artificial, laboured, in
a word, wrong in point of detail. The Hegelian system, in itself, was a
colossal miscarriage — but it was also the last of its kind. It was
suffering, in fact, from an internal and incurable contradiction. Upon the one
hand, its essential proposition was the conception that human history is a
process of evolution, which, by its very nature, cannot find its intellectual
final term in the discovery of any so-called absolute truth. But, on the other
hand, it laid claim to being the very essence of this absolute truth. A system
of natural and historical knowledge, embracing everything, and final for all
time, is a contradiction to the fundamental laws of dialectic reasoning. This
law, indeed, by no means excludes, but, on the contrary, includes the idea that
the systematic knowledge of the external universe can make giant strides from
age to age.</p>
<a id="034"></a>
<p>The perception of the fundamental contradiction in German idealism led
necessarily back to materialism, but, <i>nota bene</i>, not to the simply
metaphysical, exclusively mechanical materialism of the eighteenth century. In
contrast to the naively revolutionary, simple rejection of all previous
history, modern materialism sees in the latter the process of evolution of
humanity, it being its task to discover the laws of motion thereof. With the
French of the eighteenth century, and with Hegel, the conception obtained of
nature as a whole, moving in narrow circles, and forever immutable, with its
eternal celestial bodies, as Newton, and unalterable organic species, as
Linnaeus, taught. Modern materialism embraces the more recent discoveries of
natural science, according to which nature also has its history in time, the
celestial bodies, like the organic species that, under favourable conditions,
people them, being born and perishing. And even if nature, as a whole, must
still be said to move in recurrent cycles, these cycles assume infinitely
larger dimensions. In both cases modern materialism is essentially dialectic,
and no longer needs any philosophy standing above the other sciences. As soon
as each special science is bound to make clear its position in the great
totality of things and of our knowledge of things, a special science dealing
with this totality is superfluous. That which still survives, independently, of
all earlier philosophy is the science of thought and its laws — formal
logic and dialectics. Everything else is subsumed in the positive science of
nature and history.</p>
<a id="035"></a>
<p>Whilst, however, the revolution in the conception of nature could only be
made in proportion to the corresponding positive materials furnished by
research, already much earlier certain historical facts had occurred which led
to a decisive change in the conception of history. In 1831, the first
working-class rising took place in Lyons; between 1838 and 1842, the first
national working-class movement, that of the English Chartists, reached its
height. The class struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie came to the
front in the history of the most advanced countries in Europe, in proportion to
the development, upon the one hand, of modern industry [<i>grosse
Industrie</i>], upon the other, of the newly-acquired political supremacy of
the bourgeoisie. Facts more and more strenuously gave the lie to the teachings
of bourgeois economy as to the identity of the interests of capital and labour,
as to the universal harmony and universal prosperity that would be the
consequence of unbridled competition. All these things could no longer be
ignored, any more than the French and English socialism, which was their
theoretical, though very imperfect, expression. But the old idealist conception
of history, which was not yet dislodged knew nothing of class struggles based
upon economic interests, knew nothing of economic interests; production and all
economic relations appeared in it only as incidental, subordinate elements in
the “history of civilisation”.</p>
<a id="036"></a>
<p>The new facts made imperative a new examination of all past history. Then it
was seen that <i>all</i> past history was the history of class struggles <a href="footnotes.html#n27" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[27]</sup></a>; that these warring
classes of society are always the products of the modes of production and of
exchange — in a word, of the <i>economic</i> conditions of their time;
that the economic structure of society always furnishes the real basis,
starting from which we can alone work out the ultimate explanation of the whole
superstructure of juridical and political institutions as well as of the
religious, philosophical, and other ideas of a given historical period. But now
idealism was driven from its last refuge, the philosophy of history; now a
materialistic treatment of history was propounded, and a method found of
explaining man’s “knowing” by his “being”, instead of, as heretofore, his
“being” by his “knowing”.</p>
<a id="037"></a>
<p>But the socialism of earlier days was as incompatible with this
materialistic conception as the conception of nature of the French materialists
was with dialectics and modern natural science. The socialism of earlier days
certainly criticised the existing capitalistic mode of production and its
consequences. But it could not explain them, and, therefore, could not get the
mastery of them. It could only simply reject them as bad. But for this it was
necessary (1) to present the capitalistic method of production in its
historical connection and its inevitableness during a particular historical
period, and therefore, also, to present its inevitable downfall; and (2) to lay
bare its essential character, which was still a secret, as its critics had
hitherto attacked its evil consequences rather than the process of the thing
itself. This was done by the discovery of <i>surplus-value.</i> It was shown
that the appropriation of unpaid labour is the basis of the capitalist mode of
production and of the exploitation of the worker that occurs under it, that
even if the capitalist buys the labour-power of his labourer at its full value
as a commodity on the market, he yet extracts more value from it than he paid
for; and that in the ultimate analysis this surplus-value forms those sums of
value from which are heaped up the constantly increasing masses of capital in
the hands of the possessing classes. The genesis of capitalist production and
the production of capital were both explained.</p>
<a id="038"></a>
<p>These two great discoveries, the materialistic conception of history and the
revelation of the secret of capitalistic production through surplus-value, we
owe to <i>Marx.</i> With these discoveries socialism became a science. The
next thing was to work out all its details and relations.</p>
<a id="039"></a>
<p>This, approximately, was how things stood in the fields of theoretical
socialism and extinct philosophy, when Herr Eugen Dühring, not without
considerable din, sprang on to the stage and announced that he had accomplished
a complete revolution in philosophy, political economy and socialism.</p>
<a id="040"></a>
<p>Let us see what Herr Dühring promises us and how he fulfills his
promises.</p>

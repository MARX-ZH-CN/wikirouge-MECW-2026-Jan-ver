<p class="title">Anti-Dühring by Frederick Engels 1877<br>
Part I: Philosophy</p>
<a id="c5"></a>
<h1>V. Philosophy of Nature.<br>
Time and Space</h1>
<a id="144"></a>
<p class="fst">We now come to <i>philosophy of nature.</i> Here again Herr
Dühring has every cause for dissatisfaction with his predecessors.</p>
<a id="145"></a>
<p class="quoted">“Natural philosophy sank so low that it became an arid,
spurious doggerel founded on ignorance”, and “fell to the
prostituted philosophistics of a Schelling and his like, rigging themselves out
in the priesthood of the Absolute and hoodwinking the public”. Fatigue
has saved us from these “deformities”; but up to now it has only
given place to “instability”; “and as far as the public at
large is concerned, it is well known that the disappearance of a great
charlatan is often only the opportunity for a lesser but commercially more
experienced successor to put out again, under another signboard; the products
of his predecessor”. Natural scientists themselves feel little
“inclination to make excursions into the realm of world-encompassing
ideas”, and consequently jump to “wild and hasty conclusions in the
theoretical sphere” {D. Ph. 56-57}.</p>
<a id="146"></a>
<p class="fst">The need for deliverance is therefore urgent, and by a stroke of
good luck Herr Dühring is at hand.</p>
<a id="147"></a>
<p>In order properly to appreciate the revelations which now follow on the
development of the world in time and its limitations in space, we must turn
back again to certain passages in "world schematism" {15}.</p>
<a id="148"></a>
<p>Infinity — which Hegel calls <i>bad</i> infinity — is
attributed to being also in accordance with Hegel <i>(Encyclopaedia</i>,
<i>§ 93)</i>, and then this infinity is investigated.</p>
<a id="149"></a>
<p class="quoted">“The clearest form of an infinity which can be
conceived <i>without contradiction</i> is the unlimited accumulation of
numbers in a numerical series {18} ... As we can add yet another unit to any
number, without ever exhausting the possibility of further numbers, so also to
every state of being a further state succeeds, and infinity consists in the
unlimited begetting of these states. This <i>exactly conceived</i> infinity
has consequently only one single basic form with one single direction. For
although it is immaterial to our thought whether or not it conceives an
opposite direction in the accumulation of states, this retrogressing infinity
is nevertheless only a rashly constructed thought-image. Indeed, since this
infinity would have to be traversed in reality in the <i>reverse</i>
direction, it would in each of its states have an infinite succession of
numbers behind itself. But this would involve the impermissible contradiction
of a counted infinite numerical series, and so it is contrary to reason to
postulate any second direction in infinity” {19}.</p>
<a id="150"></a>
<p class="fst">The first conclusion drawn from this conception of infinity is
that the chain of causes and effects in the world must at some time have had a
beginning:</p>
<a id="151"></a>
<p class="quoted">“an infinite number of causes which assumedly already
have lined up next to one another is inconceivable, just because it presupposes
that the uncountable has been counted” {37}.</p>
<a id="152"></a>
<p class="fst">And thus a <i>final cause</i> is proved.</p>
<a id="153"></a>
<p>The second conclusion is</p>
<a id="154"></a>
<p class="quoted">“the law of definite number: the accumulation of
identities of any actual species of independent things is only conceivable as
forming a definite number“. Not only must the number of celestial bodies
existing at any point of time be in itself definite, but so must also the total
number of all, even the tiniest independent particles of matter existing in the
world. This latter requisite is the real reason why no composition can be
conceived without atoms. All actual division has always a definite limit, and
must have it if the contradiction of the counted uncountable is to be avoided.
For the same reason, not only must the number of the earth's revolutions round
the sun up to the present time be a definite number, even though it cannot be
stated, but all periodical processes of nature must have had some beginning,
and all differentiation, all the multifariousness of nature which appears in
succession must have its roots in one <i>self-equal state.</i> This state
may, without involving a contradiction, have existed from eternity; but even
this idea would be excluded if time in itself were composed of real parts and
were not, on the contrary, merely arbitrarily divided up by our minds owing to
the variety of conceivable possibilities. The case is quite different with the
real, and in itself distinguished content of time; this real filling of time
with distinguishable facts and the forms of being of this sphere belong,
precisely because of their distinguishability, to the realm of the countable
{64-65}. If we imagine a state in which no change occurs and which in its
self-equality provides no differences of succession whatever, the more
specialised idea of time transforms itself into the more general idea of being.
What the accumulation of empty duration would mean is quite unimaginable
{70}.</p>
<a id="155"></a>
<p class="fst">Thus far Herr Dühring, and he is not a little edified by the
significance of these revelations. At first he hopes that they will <span class="duhring">“at least not be regarded as paltry truths”</span>
{64}; but later we find:</p>
<a id="156"></a>
<p class="quoted">“Recall to your mind <i>the extremely simple</i>
methods by which <i>we</i> helped forward the concepts of infinity and their
critique to a <i>hitherto unknown import...</i> the elements of the universal
conception of space and time, which have been given such <i>simple</i> form
by the sharpening and deepening now effected” {427-28}.</p>
<a id="157"></a>
<p class="fst"><i>We</i> helped forward! The deepening and sharpening now
effected! Who are "we", and when is this "now"? Who is deepening and
sharpening?</p>
<a id="158"></a>
<p class="quoted">"Thesis: The world has a beginning in time, and with regard
to space is also limited. — Proof: For if it is assumed that the world
has no beginning in time, then an eternity must have elapsed up to every given
point of time, and consequently an infinite series of successive states of
things must have passed away in the world. The infinity of a series, however,
consists precisely in this, that it can never be completed by means of a
successive synthesis. Hence an infinite elapsed series of worlds is impossible,
and consequently a beginning of the world is a necessary condition of its
existence. And this was the first thing to be proved. — With regard to
the second, if the opposite is again assumed, then the world must be an
infinite given total of co-existent things. Now we cannot conceive the
dimensions of a quantum, which is not given within certain limits of an
intuition, in any other way than by means of the synthesis of its parts, and
can conceive the total of such a quantum only by means of a completed
synthesis, or by the repeated addition of a unit to itself. Accordingly, to
conceive the world, which fills all spaces, as a whole, the successive
synthesis of the parts of an infinite world would have to be looked upon as
completed; that is, an infinite time would have to be regarded as elapsed in
the enumeration of all co-existing things. This is impossible. For this reason
an infinite aggregate of actual things cannot be regarded as a given whole nor,
therefore, as given <i>at the same time.</i> Hence it follows that the world
is not infinite, as regards extension in space, but enclosed in limits. And
this was the second thing" (to be proved).</p>
<a id="159"></a>
<p class="fst">These sentences are copied word for word from a well-known book
which first appeared in 1781 and is called: <i>Kritik der reinen Vernunft</i>
by Immanuel Kant, where all and sundry can read them, in the first part, Second
Division, Book II, Chapter II, Section II: The First Antinomy of Pure Reason.
So that Herr Dühring's fame rests solely on his having tacked on the <i>name
—</i> Law of Definite Number — to an idea expressed by Kant, and
on having made the discovery that there was once a time when as yet there was
no time, though there was a world. As regards all the rest, that is, anything
in Herr Dühring's exegesis which has some meaning, “We” — is
Immanuel Kant, and the “now” is only ninety-five years ago.
Certainly “extremely simple”! Remarkable <span class="duhring">“hitherto unknown import”</span>!</p>
<a id="160"></a>
<p>Kant, however, does not at all claim that the above propositions are
established by his proof. On the contrary; on the opposite page he states and
proves the reverse: that the world has no beginning in time and no end in
space; and it is precisely in this that he finds the antinomy, the insoluble
contradiction, that the one is just as demonstrable as the other. People of
smaller calibre might perhaps fuel a little doubt here on account of “a
Kant” having found an insoluble difficulty. But not so our valiant
fabricator of <span class="duhring">“from the ground up original
conclusions and views”</span> {D. Ph. 525}; he indefatigably copies down
as much of Kant’s antinomy as suits his purpose, and throws the rest
aside.</p>
<a id="161"></a>
<p>The problem itself has a very simple solution. Eternity in time, infinity in
space, signify from the start, and in the simple meaning of the words, that
there is no end in <i>any</i> direction neither forwards nor backwards,
upwards or downwards, to the right or to the left. This infinity is something
quite different from that of an infinite series, for the latter always starts
from one, with a first term. The inapplicability of this idea of series to our
object becomes clear directly we apply it to space. The infinite series,
transferred to the sphere of space, is a line drawn from a definite point in a
definite direction to infinity. Is the infinity of space expressed in this even
in the remotest way? On the contrary, the idea of spatial dimensions involves
six lines drawn from this one point in three opposite directions, and
consequently we would have six of these dimensions. Kant saw this so clearly
that he transferred his numerical series only indirectly, in a roundabout way,
to the space relations of the world. Herr Dühring, on the other hand, compels
us to accept six dimensions in space, and immediately afterwards can find no
words to express his indignation at the mathematical mysticism of Gauss, who
would not rest content with the usual three dimensions of space <a href="footnotes.html#n37" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[37]</sup></a> {See D. Ph.
67-68}.</p>
<a id="162"></a>
<p>As applied to time, the line or series of units infinite in both directions
has a certain figurative meaning. But if we think of time as a series counted
from <i>one</i> forward, or as a line starting from a <i>definite
point</i>, we imply in advance that time has a beginning: we put forward as a
premise precisely what we are to prove. We give the infinity of time a
one-sided, halved character; but a one-sided, halved infinity is also a
contradiction in itself, the exact opposite of an <span class="duhring">“infinity conceived without contradiction”</span>.
We can only get past this contradiction if we assume that the <i>one</i> from
which we begin to count the series, the point from which we proceed to measure
the line is any <i>one</i> in the series, that it is any one of the points in
the line, and that it is a matter of indifference to the line or to the series
where we place this <i>one</i> or this point.</p>
<a id="163"></a>
<p>But what of the contradiction of <span class="duhring">“the counted
infinite numerical series”</span>? We shall be in a position to examine
this more closely as soon as Herr Dühring has performed for us the clever trick
of <i>counting it.</i> When he has completed the task of counting from (minus
infinity) to 0 let him come again. It is certainly obvious that, at whatever
point he begins to count, he will leave behind him an infinite series and, with
it, the task which he is to fulfil. Let him just reverse his own infinite
series 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 ... and try to count from the infinite end back to 1; it
would obviously only be attempted by a man who has not the faintest
understanding of what the problem is. And again: if Herr Dühring states that
the infinite series of elapsed time has been counted, he is thereby stating
that time has a beginning; for otherwise he would not have been able to start
“counting” at all. Once again, therefore, he puts into the
argument, as a premise, the thing that he has to prove.</p>
<a id="164"></a>
<p>The idea of an infinite series which has been counted, in other words, the
world-encompassing Dühringian law of definite number, is therefore a
<i>contradictio in adjecto</i>, <span class="context">[“contradiction
in definition” — ed.]</span> contains within itself a
contradiction, and in fact an <i>absurd</i> contradiction.</p>
<a id="165"></a>
<p>It is clear that an infinity which has an end but no beginning is neither
more nor less infinite than that which has a beginning but no end. The
slightest dialectical insight should have told Herr Dühring that beginning and
end necessarily belong together, like the north pole and the south pole, and
that if the end is left out, the beginning just becomes the end — the
<i>one</i> end which the series has; and vice versa. The whole deception
would be impossible but for the mathematical usage of working with infinite
series. Because in mathematics it is necessary to start from definite, finite
terms in order to reach the indefinite, the infinite, all mathematical series,
positive or negative, must start from 1, or they cannot be used for
calculation. The abstract requirement of a mathematician is, however, far from
being a compulsory law for the world of reality.</p>
<a id="166"></a>
<p>For that matter, Herr Dühring will never succeed in conceiving real infinity
without contradiction. Infinity is a contradiction, and is full of
contradictions. From the outset it is a contradiction that an infinity is
composed of nothing but finites, and yet this is the case. The limitedness of
the material world leads no less to contradictions than its unlimitedness, and
every attempt to get over these contradictions leads, as we have seen, to new
and worse contradictions. It is just <i>because</i> infinity is a
contradiction that it is an infinite process, unrolling endlessly in time and
in space. The removal of the contradiction would be the end of infinity. Hegel
saw this quite correctly, and for that reason treated with well-merited
contempt the gentlemen who subtilised over this contradiction.</p>
<a id="167"></a>
<p>Let us pass on. So time had a beginning. What was there before this
beginning? The universe, which was then in a self-equal, unchanging state. And
as in this state no changes succeed one another, the more specialised idea of
time transforms itself into the more general idea of <i>being.</i> In the
first place, we are here not in the least concerned with what ideas change in
Herr Dühring's head. The subject at issue is not the <i>idea of time</i>, but
<i>real</i> time, which Herr Dühring cannot rid himself of so cheaply. In the
second place, however much the idea of time may convert itself into the more
general idea of being, this does not take us one step further. For the basic
forms of all being are space and time, and being out of time is just as gross
an absurdity as being out of space. The Hegelian “being past away
non-temporally” and the neo-Schellingian <span class="duhring">“unpremeditatable being”</span> are
rational ideas compared with this being out of time. And for this reason Herr
Dühring sets to work very cautiously; actually it is of course time, but of
such a kind as cannot really be called time, time, indeed, in itself does not
consist of real parts, and is only divided up at will by our mind — only
an actual filling of time with distinguishable facts is susceptible of being
counted — what the accumulation of empty duration means is quite
unimaginable. What this accumulation is supposed to mean is here beside the
point; the question is, whether the world, in the state here assumed, has
duration, passes through a duration in time. We have long known that we can get
nothing by measuring such a duration without content just as we can get nothing
by measuring without aim or purpose in empty space; and Hegel, just because of
the weariness of such an effort, calls such an infinity <i>bad.</i> According
to Herr Dühring time exists only through change; change in and through time
does not exist. Just because time is different from change, is independent of
it, it is possible to measure it by change, for measuring always requires
something different from the thing to be measured. And time in which no
recognisable changes occur is very far removed from <i>not</i> being time; it
is rather <i>pure</i> time, unaffected by any foreign admixtures, that is,
real time, time <i>as such.</i> In fact, if we want to grasp the idea of time
in all its purity, divorced from all alien and extraneous admixtures, we are
compelled to put aside, as not being relevant here, all the various events
which occur simultaneously or one after another in time, and in this way to
form the idea of a time in which nothing happens. In doing this, therefore, we
have not let the concept of time be submerged in the general idea of being, but
have thereby for the first time arrived at the pure concept of time.</p>
<a id="168"></a>
<p>But all these contradictions and impossibilities are only mere child”s play
compared with the confusion into which Herr Dühring falls with his self-equal
initial state of the world. If the world had ever been in a state in which no
change whatever was taking place, how could it pass from this state to
alteration? The absolutely unchanging, especially when it has been in this
state from eternity, cannot possibly get out of such a state by itself and pass
over into a state of motion and change. An initial impulse must therefore have
come from outside, from outside the universe, an impulse which set it in
motion. But as everyone knows, the “initial impulse” is only another expression
for God. God and the beyond, which in his world schematism Herr Dühring
pretended to have so beautifully dismantled, are both introduced again by him
here, sharpened and deepened, into natural philosophy.</p>
<a id="169"></a>
<p>Further, Herr Dühring says:</p>
<a id="170"></a>
<p class="quoted">“Where magnitude is attributed to a constant element of
being, it will remain unchanged in its determinateness. This holds good ... of
matter and mechanical force” {D. Ph. 26}.</p>
<a id="171"></a>
<p class="fst">The first sentence, it may be noted in passing, is a precious
example of Herr Dühring's axiomatic-tautological grandiloquence: where
magnitude does not change, it remains the same. Therefore the amount of
mechanical force which exists in the world remains the same for all eternity.
We will overlook the fact that, in so far as this is correct, Descartes already
knew and said it in philosophy nearly three hundred years ago; that in natural
science the theory of the conservation of energy has held sway for the last
twenty years; and that Herr Dühring, in limiting it to <i>mechanical</i>
force, does not in any way improve on it. But where was the mechanical force at
the time of the unchanging state? Herr Dühring obstinately refuses to give us
any answer to this question.</p>
<a id="172"></a>
<p>Where, Herr Dühring, was the eternally self-equal mechanical force at that
time, and what did it put in motion? The reply:</p>
<a id="173"></a>
<p class="quoted">“The original state of the universe, or to put it more
plainly, of an unchanging existence of matter which comprised no accumulation
of changes in time, is a question which can be spurned only by a mind that sees
the acme of wisdom in the self-mutilation of its own generative power.”
{78-79}.</p>
<a id="174"></a>
<p class="fst">Therefore: either you accept without examination my unchanging
original state, or I, Eugen Dühring, the possessor of creative power, will
certify you as intellectual eunuchs. That may, of course, deter a good many
people. But we, who have already seen some examples of Herr Dühring's
generative power, can permit ourselves to leave this genteel abuse unanswered
for the moment, and ask once again: But Herr Dühring, if you please, what about
that mechanical force?</p>
<a id="175"></a>
<p>Herr Dühring at once grows embarrassed.</p>
<a id="176"></a>
<p class="quoted">In actual fact, he stammers, “the absolute identity of that
initial extreme state does not in itself provide any principle of transition.
But we must remember that at bottom the position is similar with every new
link, however small, in the chain of existence with which we are familiar. So
that whoever wants to raise difficulties in the fundamental case now under
consideration must take care that he does not allow himself to pass them by on
less obvious occasions. Moreover, there exists the possibility of interposing
successively graduated intermediate stages, and also a bridge of continuity by
which it is possible to move backwards and reach the extinction of the process
of change. It is true that from a purely conceptual standpoint this continuity
does not help us pass the main difficulty, but to us it is the basic form of
all regularity and of every known form of transition in general, so that we are
entitled to use it also as a medium between that first equilibrium and the
disturbance of it. But if we had conceived the so to speak” (!) “motionless
equilibrium on the model of the ideas which are accepted without any particular
objection” (!) “in our present-day mechanics, there would be no way of
explaining how matter could have reached the process of change.” Apart from the
mechanics of masses there is, however, we are told, also a transformation of
mass movement into the movement of extremely small particles, but as to how
this takes place — “for this up to the present we have no general
principle at our disposal and consequently we should not be surprised if these
processes take place somewhat in <i>the dark</i>” {79-80, 81}.</p>
<a id="177"></a>
<p class="fst">That is all Herr Dühring has to say. And in fact, we would have
to see the acme of wisdom not only in the <span class="duhring">“self-mutilation of our generative power”</span> {79}, but also
in blind, implicit faith, if we allowed ourselves to be put off with these
really pitiable rank subterfuges and circumlocutions. Herr Dühring admits that
absolute identity cannot of itself effect the transition to change. Nor is
there any means whereby absolute equilibrium can of itself pass into motion.
What is there, then? Three lame, false arguments.</p>
<a id="178"></a>
<p>Firstly: it is just as difficult to show the transition from each link,
however small, in the chain of existence with which we are familiar, to the
next one. — Herr Dühring seems to think his readers are infants. The
establishment of individual transitions and connections between the tiniest
links in the chain of existence is precisely the content of natural science,
and when there is a hitch at some point in its work no one, not even Herr
Dühring, thinks of explaining prior motion as having arisen out of nothing, but
always only as a transfer, transformation or transmission of some previous
motion. But here the issue is admittedly one of accepting motion as having
arisen out of immobility, that is, <i>out of nothing.</i></p>
<a id="179"></a>
<p>In the second place, we have the <span class="duhring">“bridge of
continuity”</span>. From a purely conceptual standpoint, this, to be sure, does
not help us over the difficulty, but all the same we are entitled to
<i>use</i> it as a medium between immobility and motion. Unfortunately the
continuity of immobility consists in <i>not</i> moving; how therefore it is
to produce motion remains more mysterious than ever. And however infinitely
small the parts into which Herr Dühring minces his transition from complete
non-motion to universal motion, and however long the duration he assigns to it,
we have not got a ten-thousandth part of a millimetre further. Without an act
of creation we can never get from nothing to something, even if the something
were as small as a mathematical differential. The bridge of continuity is
therefore not even an asses’ bridge <a href="footnotes.html#n37a" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[37a]</sup></a>; it is passable only for Herr Dühring.</p>
<a id="180"></a>
<p>Thirdly: so long as present-day mechanics holds good — and this
science, according to Herr Dühring, is one of the most essential levers for the
formation of thought — it cannot be explained at all how it is possible
to pass from immobility to motion. But the mechanical theory of heat shows us
that the movement of masses under certain conditions changes into molecular
movement (although here too one motion originates from another motion, but
never from immobility); and this, Herr Dühring shyly suggests, may possibly
furnish a bridge between the strictly static (in equilibrium) and dynamic (in
motion). But these processes take place “somewhat in the dark”. And it is in
the dark that Herr Dühring leaves us sitting.</p>
<a id="181"></a>
<p>This is the point we have reached with all his deepening and sharpening
— that we have perpetually gone deeper into ever sharper nonsense, and
finally land up where of necessity we had to land up — “in the dark”. But
this does not abash Herr Dühring much. Right on the next page he has the
effrontery to declare that he has</p>
<a id="182"></a>
<p class="quoted">“been able to provide a real content for the idea of
self-equal stability directly from the behaviour of matter <i>and the
mechanical forces</i>” {D. Ph. 82}.</p>
<a id="183"></a>
<p class="fst">And this man describes other people as <span class="duhring">“charlatans”</span>!</p>
<a id="184"></a>
<p>Fortunately, in spite of all this helpless wandering and confusion “in the
dark”, we are left with one consolation, and this is certainly edifying to the
soul:</p>
<a id="185"></a>
<p class="quoted">“The mathematics of the inhabitants of other celestial bodies
can rest on no other axioms than our own!” {69}.</p>

<p class="title">Anti-Dühring by Frederick Engels 1877<br>
Part III: Socialism</p>
<a id="c5"></a>
<h1>V. State, Family, Education</h1>
<p class="fst">With the two last chapters we have about exhausted the economic
content of Herr Dühring’s <span class="duhring">“new socialitarian
system”</span> {D. Ph. 295}. The only point we might add is that his
<span class="duhring">“universal range of historical survey”</span>
{D. K. G. 2} does not in the least prevent him from safeguarding his own
special interests, even apart from the moderate surplus consumption referred to
above. As the old division of labour continues to exist in the socialitarian
system, the economic commune will have to reckon not only with architects and
porters {500}, but also with professional writers, and the question will then
arise how authors’ rights are to be dealt with. This question is one
which occupies Herr Dühring’s attention more than any other. Everywhere,
for example, in connection with Louis Blanc and Proudhon {D. C. 302; D. K. G.
482-83}, the reader stumbles across the question of authors’ rights,
until it is finally brought safely into the haven of <span class="duhring">“sociality”</span>, after a circumstantial
discussion occupying nine full pages of the <i>Cursus</i>, in the form of a
mysterious <span class="duhring">“remuneration of labour”</span>
{D. C. 307} — whether with or without moderate surplus consumption, is
not stated. A chapter on the position of fleas in the natural system of society
would have been just as appropriate and in any case far less tedious. <a id="152"></a></p>
<p>The <i>Philosophie</i> gives detailed prescriptions for the organisation
of the state of the future. Here Rousseau, although <span class="duhring">“the sole important forerunner”</span> {D. Ph. 264}
of Herr Dühring, nevertheless did not lay the foundations deep enough; his more
profound successor puts this right by completely watering down Rousseau and
mixing in remnants of the Hegelian philosophy of right, also reduced to a
watery mess. <span class="duhring">“The sovereignty of the
individual”</span> {268} forms the basis of the Dühringian state of the
future; it is not to be suppressed by the rule of the majority, but to find its
real culmination in it. How does this work? Very simply. <a id="153"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“If one presupposes agreements between each individual
and every other individual in all directions, and if the object of these
agreements is mutual aid against unjust offences — then the power
required for the maintenance of right is only strengthened, and right is not
deduced from the more superior strength of the many against the individual or
of the majority against the minority” {268}. <a id="154"></a></p>
<p class="fst">Such is the ease with which the living force of the hocus-pocus
of the philosophy of reality surmounts the most impassable obstacles; and if
the reader thinks that after that he is no wiser than he was before, Herr
Dühring replies that he really must not think it is such a simple matter, for
<a id="155"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“the <i>slightest error</i> in the conception of the
role of the collective will would <i>destroy</i> the sovereignty of the
individual, and this sovereignty is the only thing” (!) “conducive
to the deduction of real rights” {268}. <a id="156"></a></p>
<p class="fst">Herr Dühring treats his public as it deserves, when he makes
game of it. He could have laid it on much thicker; the students of the
philosophy of reality would not have noticed it anyhow. <a id="157"></a></p>
<p>Now the sovereignty of the individual consists essentially in that <a id="158"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“the individual is <i>subject to absolute
compulsion</i> by the state”; this compulsion, however, can only be
justified in so far as it “really serves natural justice” {271}.
With this end in view there will be “legislative and judicial
authority”, which, however, “must remain in the hands of the
community” {272}; and there will also be an alliance for defence, which
will find expression in “joint action in the army or in an executive
section for the maintenance of internal security” {273}, <a id="159"></a></p>
<p class="fst">that is to say, there will also be army, police, gendarmerie.
Herr Dühring has many times already shown that he is a good Prussian; here he
proves himself a peer of that model Prussian, who, as the late Minister von
Rochow put it, <span class="duhring">“carries his gendarme in his
breast”</span>. This gendarmerie of the future, however, will not be so
dangerous as the police thugs <a href="footnotes.html#n125" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[125]</sup></a> of the present day. Whatever the sovereign
individual may suffer at their hands, he will always have <i>one
consolation</i>: <a id="160"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“the right or wrong which, according to the
circumstances, may then be dealt to him by free society can never be
<i>an</i>y <i>worse</i> than that which the <i>state of nature</i> would
have brought with it” {D. Ph. 274}! <a id="161"></a></p>
<p class="fst">And then, after Herr Dühring has once more tripped us up on
those authors’ rights of his which are always getting in the way, he assures us
that in his world of the future <a id="162"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">there will be, “of course, an absolutely free Bar available
to all” {279}. <a id="163"></a></p>
<p class="fst"><span class="duhring">“The free society, as it is conceived
today”</span> {304}, gets steadily more and more mixed. Architects, porters,
professional writers, gendarmes, and now also barristers! This <span class="duhring">“world of sober and critical thought”</span> {D. C. 556-57} and
the various heavenly kingdoms of the different religions, in which the believer
always finds in transfigured form the things which have sweetened his earthly
existence, are as like as two peas. And Herr Dühring is a citizen of the state
where “everyone can be happy in his own way”. <a href="footnotes.html#n126" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[126]</sup></a> What more do we want? <a id="164"></a></p>
<p>But it does not matter what we want. What matters is what Herr Dühring
wants. And he differs from Frederick II in this, that in the Dühringian future
state certainly not everyone will be able to be happy in his own way. The
constitution of this future state provides: <a id="165"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“In the free society there can be no religious worship;
<i>for</i> every member of it has got beyond the primitive childish
superstition that there are beings, behind nature or above it, who can be
influenced by sacrifices or prayers” {D. Ph. 286}. A “socialitarian system,
rightly conceived, <i>has</i> therefore ... <i>to abolish</i> all the
paraphernalia of religious magic, and therewith all the essential elements of
religious worship” {D. C. 345}. <a id="166"></a></p>
<p class="fst">Religion is being prohibited. <a id="167"></a></p>
<p>All religion, however, is nothing but the fantastic reflection in men’s
minds of those external forces which control their daily life, a reflection in
which the terrestrial forces assume the form of supernatural forces. In the
beginnings of history it was the forces of nature which were first so
reflected, and which in the course of further evolution underwent the most
manifold and varied personifications among the various peoples. This early
process has been traced back by comparative mythology, at least in the case of
the Indo-European peoples, to its origin in the Indian Vedas, and in its
further evolution it has been demonstrated in detail among the Indians,
Persians, Greeks, Romans, Germans and, so far as material is available, also
among the Celts, Lithuanians and Slavs. But it is not long before, side by side
with the forces of nature, social forces begin to be active — forces
which confront man as equally alien and at first equally inexplicable,
dominating him with the same apparent natural necessity as the forces of nature
themselves. The fantastic figures, which at first only reflected the mysterious
forces of nature, at this point acquire social attributes, become
representatives of the forces of history. <a href="notes.html#n*16" target=_blank><sup class="enote">*16</sup></a> At a still further stage of evolution, all the
natural and social attributes of the numerous gods are transferred to
<i>one</i> almighty god, who is but a reflection of the abstract man. Such
was the origin of monotheism, which was historically the last product of the
vulgarised philosophy of the later Greeks and found its incarnation in the
exclusively national god of the Jews, Jehovah. In this convenient, handy and
universally adaptable form, religion can continue to exist as the immediate,
that is, the sentimental form of men's relation to the alien, natural and
social, forces which dominate them, so long as men remain under the control of
these forces. However, we have seen repeatedly that in existing bourgeois
society men are dominated by the economic conditions created by themselves, by
the means of production which they themselves have produced, as if by an alien
force. The actual basis of the religious reflective activity therefore
continues to exist, and with it the religious reflection itself. And although
bourgeois political economy has given a certain insight into the causal
connection of this alien domination, this makes no essential difference.
Bourgeois economics can neither prevent crises in general, nor protect the
individual capitalists from losses, bad debts and bankruptcy, nor secure the
individual workers against unemployment and destitution. It is still true that
man proposes and God (that is, the alien domination of the capitalist mode of
production) disposes. Mere knowledge, even if it went much further and deeper
than that of bourgeois economic science, is not enough to bring social forces
under the domination of society. What is above all necessary for this, is a
social <i>act</i>. And when this act has been accomplished, when society, by
taking possession of all means of production and using them on a planned basis,
has freed itself and all its members from the bondage in which they are now
held by these means of production which they themselves have produced but which
confront them as an irresistible alien force, when therefore man no longer
merely proposes, but also disposes — only then will the last alien force
which is still reflected in religion vanish; and with it will also vanish the
religious reflection itself, for the simple reason that then there will be
nothing left to reflect. <a id="168"></a></p>
<p>Herr Dühring, however, cannot wait until religion dies this, its natural,
death. He proceeds in more deep-rooted fashion. He out-Bismarcks Bismarck; he
decrees sharper May laws <a href="footnotes.html#n127" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[127]</sup></a> not merely against Catholicism, but against all
religion whatsoever; he incites his gendarmes of the future against religion,
and thereby helps it to martyrdom and a prolonged lease of life. Wherever we
turn, we find specifically Prussian socialism. <a id="169"></a></p>
<p>After Herr Dühring has thus happily destroyed religion, <a id="170"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“man, made to rely solely on himself and nature, and matured
in the knowledge of his collective powers, can intrepidly enter on all the
roads which the course of events and his own being open to him” {D. Ph. 407}.
<a id="171"></a></p>
<p class="fst">Let us now consider for a change what <span class="duhring">“course of events”</span> the man made to rely on himself can
intrepidly enter on, led by Herr Dühring. <a id="172"></a></p>
<p>The first course of events whereby man is made to rely on himself is: being
born. Then, <a id="173"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">for the period of natural minority, he remains committed to
the “natural tutor of children”, his mother. “This period may last, as in
ancient Roman law, until puberty, that is to say, until about the fourteenth
year.” Only when badly brought up older boys do not pay proper respect to their
mother’s authority will recourse be had to paternal assistance, and
particularly to the public educational regulations to remedy this. At puberty
the child becomes subject to “the natural guardianship of his father”, if there
is such a one “of real and uncontested paternity” {293, 294}; otherwise the
community appoints a guardian. <a id="174"></a></p>
<p class="fst">Just as Herr Dühring at an earlier point imagined that the
capitalist mode of production could be replaced by the social without
transforming production itself, so now he fancies that the modern bourgeois
family can be torn from its whole economic foundations without changing its
entire form. To him, this form is so immutable that he even makes <span class="duhring">“ancient Roman law”</span> {293}, though in a somewhat <span class="duhring">“ennobled”</span> form, govern the family for all time; and he
can conceive a family only as a <span class="duhring">“bequeathing”</span> {D.
C. 291}, which means a possessing, unit. Here the utopians are far in advance
of Herr Dühring. They considered that the socialisation of youth education and,
with this, real freedom in the mutual relations between members of a family,
would directly follow from the free association of men and the transformation
of private domestic work into a public industry. Moreover, Marx has already
shown (<i>Capital</i>, {Vol. I,} p. 515 <i>et seqq</i>.) that “modern
industry, by assigning as it does an important part in the socially organised
process of production, outside the domestic sphere, to women, to young persons,
and to children of both sexes, creates a new economic foundation for a higher
form of the family and of the relations between the sexes”. <a id="175"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“Every dreamer of social reforms,” says Herr Dühring,
“naturally has ready a pedagogy corresponding to his new social life” {D. K. G.
295}. <a id="176"></a></p>
<p class="fst">If we are to judge by this thesis, Herr Dühring is <span class="duhring">“a veritable monster”</span> {261} among the dreamers of social
reforms. For the school of the future occupies his attention at the very least
as much as the author’s rights, and this is really saying a great deal. He has
his curricula for school and university all ready and complete, not only for
the whole “foreseeable future” {D. Ph. 1} but also for the transition period.
But we will confine ourselves to what will be taught to the young people of
both sexes in the final and ultimate socialitarian system. <a id="177"></a></p>
<p>The universal people’s school will provide <a id="178"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“everything which by itself and in principle can have any
attraction for man”, and therefore in particular the “foundations and main
conclusions of all sciences touching on the understanding of the world and of
life” {284}. In the first place, therefore, it teaches mathematics, and indeed
to such effect that the field of all fundamental concepts and methods, from
simple numeration and addition to the integral calculus, is “completely
compassed” {418}. <a id="179"></a></p>
<p class="fst">But this does not mean that in this school anyone will really
differentiate or integrate. On the contrary. What is to be taught there will
be, rather, entirely new elements of general mathematics, which contain in
embryo both ordinary elementary and higher mathematics. And although Herr
Dühring asserts that <a id="180"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">he already has in his mind <span class="duhring">“schematically, in their main outlines”</span>, <span class="duhring">“the contents of the textbooks”</span> {415} which the school
of the future will use, <a id="181"></a></p>
<p class="fst">he has unfortunately not as yet succeeded in discovering these
<a id="182"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“elements of general mathematics”; <a id="183"></a></p>
<p class="fst">and what he cannot achieve <a id="184"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“can only really be expected from the free and enhanced
forces of the new social order” {D. Ph. 418}. <a id="185"></a></p>
<p class="fst">But if the grapes of the mathematics of the future are still
very sour, future astronomy, mechanics and physics will present all the less
difficulty and will <a id="186"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“provide the kernel of all schooling”, while “the science of
plants and animals, which, in spite of all theories, is mainly of a descriptive
character” will serve “rather as topics for light conversation” {416-17}. <a id="187"></a></p>
<p class="fst">There it is, in black and white, in the <i>Philosophie</i>,
page 417. Even to the present day Herr Dühring knows no other botany and
zoology than those which are mainly descriptive. The whole of organic
morphology, which embraces the comparative anatomy, embryology, and
palaeontology of the organic world, is entirely unknown to him even by name.
While in the sphere of biology totally new sciences are springing up, almost by
the dozen, behind his back, his puerile spirit still goes to Raff’s
<i>Naturgeschichte fur Kinder</i> for <span class="duhring">“the eminently
modern educative elements provided by the natural-scientific mode of
thought”</span> {D. K.G. 504}, and this constitution of the organic world he
decrees likewise for the whole <span &ldquo;"foreseeable="" class="duhring" future&ldquo;<="" span="">. Here, too, as is his wont, he entirely forgets chemistry. <a id="188"></a></span></p>
<p>As for the aesthetic side of education, Herr Dühring will have to fashion it
all anew. The poetry of the past is worthless for this purpose. Where all
religion is prohibited, it goes without saying that the <span class="duhring">“mythological or other religious trimmings”</span>
characteristic of poets up to now cannot be tolerated in this school. <span class="duhring">“Poetic mysticism”</span>, too, <span class="duhring">“such as,
for example, Goethe practiced so extensively”</span>, is to be condemned. Herr
Dühring will therefore have to make up his mind to produce for us those poetic
masterpieces which “are in accord with the higher claims of an imagination
reconciled with reason”, and represent the genuine ideal, which <span class="duhring">“denotes the consummation of the world”</span> {D. Ph. 423}.
Let him not tarry with it! The economic commune can achieve its conquest of the
world only when it moves along at the Alexandrine double, reconciled with
reason. <a id="189"></a></p>
<p>The adolescent citizen of the future will not be much troubled with
philology. <a id="190"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“The dead languages will be entirely discarded ... the
foreign living languages, however, ... will remain of secondary importance.”
Only where intercourse between nations extends to the movement of the masses of
the peoples themselves would these languages be made accessible, according to
needs and in an easy form. “Really educative study of language” will be
provided by a kind of general grammar, and particularly by study of the
“substance and form of one’s own language” {426-27}. <a id="191"></a></p>
<p class="fst">The national narrow-mindedness of modern man is still much too
cosmopolitan for Herr Dühring. He wants also to do away with the two levers
which in the world as it is today give at least the opportunity of rising above
the narrow national standpoint: knowledge of the ancient languages, which opens
a wider common horizon at least to those people of various nationalities who
have had a classical education; and knowledge of modern languages, through the
medium of which alone the people of different nations can make themselves
understood by one another and acquaint themselves with what is happening beyond
their own borders. On the contrary, the grammar of the mother tongue is to be
thoroughly drilled in. <span class="duhring">“Substance and form of one’s own
language”</span>, however, become intelligible only when its origin and gradual
evolution are traced, and this cannot be done without taking into account,
first, its own extinct forms, and secondly, cognate languages, both living and
dead. But this brings us back again to territory which has been expressly
forbidden. If Herr Dühring strikes out of his curriculum all modern historical
grammar, there is nothing left for his language studies but the old-fashioned
technical grammar, cut to the old classical philological pattern, with all its
casuistry and arbitrariness, based on the lack of any historical basis. His
hatred of the old philology makes him elevate the very worst product of the old
philology to <span class="duhring">“the central point of the really educative
study of language”</span> {427}. It is clear that we have before us a linguist
who has never heard a word of the tremendous and successful development of the
historical science of language which took place during the last sixty years,
and who therefore seeks <span class="duhring">“the eminently modern educative
elements”</span> {D. K. G. 504} of linguistics, not in Bopp, Grimm and Diez,
but in Heyse and Becker of blessed memory. <a id="192"></a></p>
<p>But all this would still fall far short of making the young citizen of the
future “rely on himself”. To achieve this, it is necessary here again to lay a
deeper foundation, by means of <a id="193"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“the assimilation of the latest philosophical principles”.
“Such a deepening of the foundation, however, will not be... at all a gigantic
task”, now that Herr Dühring has cleared the path. In fact, “if one purges of
the spurious, scholastic excrescences those few strictly scientific truths of
which the general schematics of being can boast, and determines to admit as
valid only the reality authenticated” by Herr Dühring, elementary philosophy
becomes perfectly accessible also to the youth of the future. “Recall to your
mind the <i>extremely simple</i> methods by which we helped forward the
concepts of infinity and their critique to a hitherto unknown import” —
and then “you will not be able to see at all why the elements of the universal
conception of space and time, which have been given such simple form by the
deepening and sharpening now effected, should not eventually pass into the
ranks of the elementary studies... The most deep-rooted ideas” of Herr Dühring
“should play no secondary role in the universal educational scheme of the new
society” {D. Ph. 427-28}. The self-equal state of matter and the counted
uncountable are on the contrary destined “not merely to put man on his own feet
but also to make him realise of himself that he <i>has the so-called absolute
underfoot”.</i> <a id="194"></a></p>
<p class="fst">The people’s school of the future, as one can see, is nothing
but a somewhat “ennobled” Prussian grammar school in which Greek and Latin are
replaced by a little more pure and applied mathematics and in particular by the
elements of the philosophy of reality, and the teaching of German is brought
back to Becker, of blessed memory, that is, down to about a fourth-form level.
And in fact, now that we have demonstrated Herr Dühring’s mere schoolboy
“knowledge” in all the spheres on which he has touched, the reader will “not be
able to see at all” why it, or rather, such of it as is left after our
preliminary thorough “purging”, should not all and sundry “eventually pass into
the ranks of the elementary studies” — inasmuch as in reality it has
never left these ranks. True, Herr Dühring has heard something about the
combination of work and instruction in socialist society, which is to ensure an
all-round technical education as well as a practical foundation for scientific
training; and this point, too is therefore brought in, in his usual way, to
help the socialitarian scheme {284, 414}. But because, as we have seen, the old
division of labour, in its essentials, is to remain undisturbed in the
Dühringian production of the future, this technical training at school is
deprived of any practical application later on, or any significance for
production itself; it has a purpose only within the school: it is to replace
gymnastics, which our deep-rooted revolutioniser wants to ignore altogether. He
can therefore offer us only a few phrases, as for example, <a id="195"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“young and old will work, in the serious sense of the word”
{D. C. 328}. <a id="196"></a></p>
<p class="fst">This spineless and meaningless ranting is really pitiful when
one compares it with the passage in <i>Capital</i>, pages 508 to 515, in
which Marx develops the thesis that “from the Factory system budded, as Robert
Owen has shown us in detail, the germ of the education of the future, an
education that will, in the case of every child over a given age, combine
productive labour with instruction and gymnastics, not only as one of the
methods of adding to the efficiency of production, but as the only method of
producing fully developed human beings”. <a id="197"></a></p>
<p>We must skip the university of the future, in which the philosophy of
reality will be the kernel of all knowledge, and where, alongside the Faculty
of Medicine, the Faculty of Law will continue in full bloom; we must also omit
the “special training institutions”, about which all we learn is that they will
be only “for a few subjects”. Let us assume that the young citizen of the
future has passed all his educational courses and has at last been “made to
rely upon himself” sufficiently to be able to look about for a wife. What is
the course of events which Herr Dühring offers him in this sphere? <a id="198"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“In view of the importance of propagation for the
conservation, elimination, blending, and even new creative development of
qualities, the ultimate roots of the human and unhuman must to a great extent
be sought in sexual union and selection, and furthermore in the care taken for
or against the ensuring of certain birth results. We must leave it practically
to a later epoch to judge the brutality and stupidity now rife in this sphere.
Nevertheless we must at least make clear from the outset, even in spite of the
weight of prejudice, that far more important than the number of births is
surely whether nature or human circumspection succeeded or failed in regard to
their quality. It is true that at all times and under all legal systems
monstrosities have been destroyed; but there is a wide range of degrees between
the normal human being and deformities which lack all resemblance to the human
being... It is obviously an advantage to prevent the birth of a human being who
would only be a defective creature” {D. Ph. 246}. <a id="199"></a></p>
<p class="fst">Another passage runs: <a id="200"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“Philosophic thought can find no difficulty ... in
comprehending the right of the unborn world to the best possible composition...
Conception and, if need be, also birth offer the opportunity for preventive, or
in exceptional cases selective, care in this connection” {395-96}. <a id="201"></a></p>
<p class="fst">Again: <a id="202"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“Grecian art — the idealisation of man in marble
— will not be able to retain its historical importance when the less
artistic, and therefore, from the standpoint of the fate of the millions, far
more important task of perfecting the human form in flesh and blood is taken in
hand. This form of art does not merely deal with stone, and its aesthetics is
not concerned with the contemplation of dead forms” {256} — and so on. <a id="203"></a></p>
<p class="fst">Our budding citizen of the future is brought to earth again.
Even without Herr Dühring's help he certainly knew that marriage is not an art
which merely deals with stone, or even with the contemplation of dead forms;
but after all, Herr Dühring had promised him that he would be able to strike
out along all roads which the course of events and his own nature opened to
him, in order to discover a sympathetic female heart together with the body
belonging to it. Nothing of the kind — the “deeper and stricter morality”
{D. Ph. 396} thunders at him. The first thing that he must do is to cast off
the brutality and stupidity now rife in the sphere of sexual union and
selection, and bear in mind the right of ‘the new-born world to the best
possible composition‘. At this solemn moment it is to him a matter of perfecting
the human form in flesh and blood, of becoming a Phidias, so to speak, in flesh
and blood. How is he to set about it? Herr Dühring’s mysterious utterances
quoted above give him not the slightest indication, although Herr Dühring
himself says it is an “art”. Has Herr Dühring perhaps “in his mind’s eye,
schematically”, a textbook also on this subject — of the kind of which,
in sealed wrappers, German bookshops are now so full? Indeed, we are no longer
in socialitarian society, but rather in the <i>Magic Flute</i> <a href="footnotes.html#n128" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[128]</sup></a> — the only
difference being that Sarastro, the stout Masonic priest, would hardly rank as
a “priest of the second order” {460} in comparison with our deeper and stricter
moralist. The tests ~ to which Sarastro put his couple of love’s adepts are
mere child's play compared with the terrifying examination through which Herr
Dühring puts his two sovereign individuals before he permits them to enter the
state of “free and ethical marriage” {296}. And so it may happen that our
“made-to-be-self-reliant” Tamino of the future may indeed have the so-called
absolute underfoot, but one of his feet may be a couple of rungs short of what
it should be, so that evil tongues call him a club-foot. It is also within the
realm of the possible that his best-beloved Pamina of the future does not hold
herself quite straight on the above-said absolute, owing to a slight deviation
in the direction of her right shoulder which jealous tongues might even call a
little hump. What then? Will our deeper and stricter Sarastro forbid them to
practice the art of perfecting humanity, in flesh and blood; will he exercise
his “preventive care” at “conception”, or his “selective care” at “birth”
{396}? Ten to one, things will happen otherwise; the pair of lovers will leave
Sarastro-Dühring where he stands and go off to the registry office. <a id="204"></a></p>
<p>Hold on there! Herr Dühring cries. This is not at all what was meant. Give
me a chance to explain! <a id="205"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">If the “higher, genuinely human motives of wholesome sexual
unions... the humanly ennobled form of sexual excitement, which in its intense
manifestation is <i>passionate love</i>, when reciprocated is the best
guarantee of a union which will be acceptable also in its result... it is only
an effect of the second order that from a relation which in itself is
harmonious a symphoniously composed product should result. From this in turn it
follows that any compulsion must have harmful effects” {247} — and so on.
<a id="206"></a></p>
<p class="fst">And thus all ends the very best way in the best of all possible
socialitarian worlds: club-foot and hunchback love each other passionately, and
therefore in their reciprocal relation offer the best guarantee for a
harmonious “effect of the second order”; it is all just like a novel —
they love each other, they get each other, and all the deeper and stricter
morality {396} turns out as usual to be harmonious twaddle. <a id="207"></a></p>
<p>Herr Dühring’s noble ideas about the female sex in general can be gathered
from the following indictment of existing society: <a id="208"></a></p>
<p class="quoted">“In a society of oppression based on the sale of human being
to human being, prostitution is accepted as the natural complement of
compulsory marriage ties in the men's favour, and it is one of the most
comprehensible but also <i>most significant</i> facts <i>that nothing of the
kind is possible for the women</i>” {291-92}. <a id="209"></a></p>
<p class="fst">I would not care, for anything in the world, to have the thanks
which might accrue to Herr Dühring from the women for this compliment. But has
Herr Dühring really never heard of the form of income known as a
petticoat-pension <i>{Schurzenstipendien}</i>, which is now no longer quite
an exceptional thing? Herr Dühring himself was once a referendary <a href="footnotes.html#n129" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[129]</sup></a> and he lives in
Berlin, where even in my day, thirty-six years ago, to say nothing of
lieutenants <i>Referendarius</i> was used often enough to rhyme with
<i>Schurzenstipendarius!</i> <a id="210"></a></p>

<p class="fst">May the reader permit us to take leave of our subject, which has
often been dry and gloomy enough, on a note of facetiousness and
reconciliation. So long as we had to deal with the separate issues raised, our
judgment was bound by the objective, incontrovertible facts, and on the basis
of these facts it was often enough necessarily sharp and even hard. Now when
philosophy, economics and socialitarian system all lie behind us; when we have
before us the picture of the author as a whole, which we had previously to
judge in detail — now human considerations can come into the foreground;
at this point we shall be permitted to trace back to personal causes many
otherwise incomprehensible scientific errors and conceits, and to sum up our
verdict against Herr Dühring in the words: <i>mental incompetence due to
megalomania.</i></p>

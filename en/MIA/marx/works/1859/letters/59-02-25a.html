<h4> [London,] 25 February 1859</h4>
<p> Dear Engels,</p>
<p><i>Po and Rhine</i> is a first-class idea and must be put in hand straight away. You must <i>set to </i><strong>at once</strong><i>, </i>time being everything in this case. I have written to Lassalle this very day and am sure that little Jew Braun will put the thing through.</p>
<p>The pamphlet (<strong>how many sheets</strong>? Let me have the answer to this <i>by return</i>) must first appear anonymously so that the public believes the author to be an eminent general. In the second edition, which you may account a certainty provided the thing comes out on time, you will reveal your identity in a <strong>6-line</strong> foreword, and then it will be a triumph for our party. In my ‘Preface’ I have done you a few <i>honneurs</i>; and thus it is all to the good if you yourself take the stage immediately afterwards.</p>
<p>Those dogs of democrats and liberal riff-raff will see that we're the only chaps who haven’t been stultified by the ghastly period of peace.</p>
<p>In any case, you'll get the <i>copies</i> of the <i>Tribune</i>. Not one of the military articles has so far been published. Mr Dana <i>didn’t</i> print the first, which you wrote <strong>a long time ago</strong>, but will probably do so now. I too constantly experience the like. It’s often three months before the asses discover that we've foretold <strong>events</strong> for them, whereupon they print the relevant articles.</p>
<p>My brother-in-law’s address is correct save that he forgot to add ‘<strong>City (near the General Post Office)’.</strong> But I imagine he'll be in Manchester by now and able to tell you about himself.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i>. </p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. M. </p>

<h4>London, 5 May 1859<br>
9 Grafton Terrace, Maitland Park, Haverstock Hill</h4>
<p>Dear Lassalle,</p>
<p>From the enclosed letter dated April 12, which I should like to have back, you will see that there is a very considerable difference between the terms offered me by your cousin Friedländer and the terms you originally communicated to me. Nevertheless I replied <i>by return</i> accepting them.  I merely noted:</p>
<p>1. that I could not make disbursements for telegrams, a point, by the by, that hardly needed mentioning and had been anticipated in your letter;</p>
<p>2. that, if we came to an arrangement, I should like (though I did not make it a <i>conditio sine qua</i>) to be able to draw on them with a <strong>banker </strong>here for articles, etc., sent, as is done in the case of the <i>Tribune</i>.</p>
<p>So far there has been no answer, which I find strange. If the editors have changed their minds, they might have had the decency to inform me. As you are aware, I did not in any way thrust myself forward in this matter. But, having accepted, I made one or two preliminary approaches to English newspapers, etc., and I am specially anxious not to be compromised in the eyes of these people and other acquaintances whom I have informed of the matter for business reasons. That I, for my part, have not yet sent off any article is only natural, since there is still no firm engagement.</p>
<p>The elections here have not, alas, turned out to be sufficiently Tory. Had this been the case there would, <strong>by</strong> and <strong>by</strong>, have been the beginnings of a revolutionary movement here. Palmerston’s return to the <strong>Foreign Ministry</strong> can now, <strong>after some shuffling</strong> be regarded as certain and hence Russia will again be in direct control of English policy.</p>
<p><i>Salut</i>.</p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>

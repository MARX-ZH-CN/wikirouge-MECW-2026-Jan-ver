<h4>[London,] 24 February 1869</h4>
<p><strong>Dear Fred</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>Best thanks</strong> for the <strong>Report</strong> <span class="context">[on the coalminers in Saxony]</span>. It is transparently clear. I have changed nothing, except to strike out the final sentence (or rather some words of it). Yesterday read out in the Central Council. Adopted. Will be sent first to <i>The Times </i>(or rather taken there by Eccarius). If they don’t take it, then to <i>The Daily News. </i>Then the English press cutting will be sent to <i>Zukunft, Social-Demokrat </i>and <i>Wilhelm. </i>The <strong>poor devils</strong> of Lugau will have the great satisfaction of being mentioned in the English press.</p>
<p>Enclosed <strong>Resolutions</strong><i>, </i>etc., 6 in all. The circumstances are as follows. The resolution of the Congress (Brussels) obliged us to have the Brussels resolutions printed. Using the excuse that the <i>Geneva </i>resolutions form part of the <strong>platform</strong>, we have printed, at the same time, <i>part </i>of what was tabled at the Geneva congress by the London Central Council and adopted by the Geneva congress, omitting the amendments, etc., proposed by the French in Geneva and <i>also </i>adopted — rubbishy stuff. Thus, this portion is written by me. On the other hand, I had no part in drafting the 1868 <strong>Resolutions</strong>. The only phrase from me verbatim is the <strong>first considering ‘On the effects of machinery’.</strong></p>
<p>That Bakunin should lay claim to the ‘Slav’ brothers in Courland and Livonia is great. Neither are his <strong>claims on</strong> Silesia bad.</p>
<p>What about Foster, <strong>Exchanges</strong>?</p>
<p>Meissner is a fine fellow; I sent him, a few days <i>before </i>your visit to London, a copy of Louis <i>Bonaparte. </i>Asked for <i>immediate </i>notification. No word yet.</p>
<p>Wilhelm remains unchangeably the same. He wrote to me that he had sent 50 or 60 copies to Kugelmann, but Kugelmann in fact has received only 6 copies!</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>

<h4>[London,] 14 November 1864</h4>
<p>Dear Engels,</p>
<p>I have had to stay mainly <i>in bed </i>for almost a week on account of the carbuncle. The thing is now <i>healing up. </i>However, as the carbuncle is just below the breast, I still have trouble leaning forward in order to write. So, to keep it as brief as possible:</p>
<p>1. Please send the <i>enclosed </i>letters addressed to me back to me (both the one from Schweitzer and the one from Liebknecht) and reply <i>by return, </i>as the people need our reply as soon as possible.</p>
<p>My view is that we should <i>promise </i>occasional contributions from time to time. It is important for us to have a mouthpiece in Berlin, especially for the sake of the association I was involved in founding in London, and for the sake of the book <span class="context">[Capital]</span> I am planning to publish. It is also important that whatever we do, we do it <i>together.</i></p>
<p>If you agree with me, you can <i>send </i>me a few lines for these chaps, or say in a few lines what statement <i>I</i> am to make in your name.</p>
<p>2. You will receive the ‘<strong>Address’ </strong>along with the ‘<strong>Provisional Rules’ </strong>etc., in a few days. The thing was not quite so difficult as you think, because we are dealing with ‘workers’ all the time. The only <strong>literary man</strong> in the Association is the Englishman, Peter Fox, a writer and <strong>agitator</strong> who is, at the same time, one of the people from <i>The National Reformer </i>(atheist but anti-Holyoake). I am sending you the very kind note he passed on to me concerning the ‘<strong>Address’.</strong> Mazzini is <strong>rather disgusted</strong> that his people are among the signatories, <i>mais il faut faire bonne mine a mauvais jeu</i> <span class="context">[one has to grin and bear it]</span><i>.</i></p>
<p>3. Your stuff from the <i>Guardian </i>I find most valuable. I had already pieced this abomination together from the ‘<strong>Factory Reports</strong>’, but only in a most laborious and fragmentary fashion.</p>
<p>4. 2 <strong>copies</strong> received from the Manchester <strong>solicitor</strong> for signing, etc. In a day or two, I shall send you the signed copies, along with the list (inventory), etc., which you will then have to record. Of course, I can no longer reel off a complete list of all the stuff we left in the flat, etc., and put a value on it.</p>
<p>That old <strong>humbug</strong> McCulloch has died. I hope the British Museum buys up his <strong>economical library</strong>. But no doubt Edinburgh will get in first.</p>
<p><i>Salut.</i></p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. M.</p>
<p>I have just come across P. Fox’s letter, which I am enclosing; please send it back as soon as you have had time to peruse it.</p>

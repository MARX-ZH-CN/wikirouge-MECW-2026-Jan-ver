<p class="indentb">Chi mi dara la voce e le parole, <br>
E un proferir magnanimo e profondo! <br>
Che mai cosa piufiera sotto il sole <br>
Nonfu veduta in tutto quanto il mondo; <br>
L'altre battagliefur rose e viole, <br>
Al raccontar di questa mi confondo; <br>
Perche il valor, e'l pregio della terra <br>
Afronte son condotti in questa guerra.</p>
<p class="indentb">(Boiardo, <i>Orlando Inamorato</i>, Canto 27)</p>
<p class="indentb">[Now who will give me words and who the tongue, <br>
To sing of such brave deeds in sonorous sounds! <br>
For ne'er was strife upon this earth begun <br>
More proudly fought on bloodier battle grounds; <br>
Compared to this all other wars are roses <br>
To tell of it my Iyric art confounds <br>
For on this earth there ne'er was seen such glory <br>
Or noble velour bright as in this story]</p>
<p class="fst">The latest fashionable arrivals had made up the full complement
of the Emigration and the time had now come for a more comprehensive
“organisation”, to round it off upwards to a full dozen. As might
have been expected these attempts degenerated into bitter feuds. The paper war
conducted in the transatlantic journals now reached its climax. The privations
of individuals, intrigues, plots, self-praise — the heroes spent their
energies in such paltry activities. But the Emigration did have one achievement
to its credit: a history of its own, lying outside world history, with its own
political petti-foggery running parallel to public affairs. And the very fact
that they fought each other so bitterly led each to believe in the importance
of the other. Beneath the façade of all these strivings and conflicts lay the
speculation in democratic party funds, “the Holy Grail”, and this
transformed these transcendental rivalries, these disputes about the
Emperor’s beard, into ordinary quarrels among fools. Anyone who wishes to
pursue the study of this great war between the frogs and the mice will find all
the decisive original documents in the <i>New-Yorker Schnellpost</i>, the New
York <i>Deutsche Zeitung</i>, the <i>Allgemeine Deutsche Zeitung</i> and
the <i>Staatszeitung</i>, in the Baltimore <i>Correspondent</i>, in the
<i>Wecker</i> [Clarion] and in other German-American papers. However, this
display of alleged connections and imagined conspiracies, this whole hue and
cry raised by the <i>émigrés</i> was not without serious consequences. It
provided the governments with the pretext they needed to arrest all sorts of
people in Germany, to suppress the indigenous movements and to use these
wretched strawmen in London as scarecrows with which to frighten the German
middle classes. Far from constituting any danger to existing circumstances
these heroes of the exile wished only that everything should die down in
Germany so that their voice might be heard the better and that the general
level of thought should decline so far that even men of their stature might
appear outstanding.</p>
<p>The newly-arrived South German <i>bonhommes</i>, lacking in any definite
commitment, found themselves in an excellent position to mediate between the
various cliques and, at the same time, to gather the mass of <i>émigrés</i>
around the leaders as a kind of chorus. Their sturdy sense of duty impelled
them not to forgo this opportunity.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, they could already see Ledru-Rollin where he saw
himself, namely in the chair of the president of France. As the most important
neighbours of France it was vital for them to obtain recognition from the
provisional government of France as the provisional overlords of Germany. Sigel
especially wished to see his supreme command guaranteed by Ledru. But the way
to Ledru led over Arnold’s corpse. However, they were still impressed by
Arnold’s <i>persona</i> and he still passed as the philosophical
Northern Light who would illumine their South German twilight. So they turned
to Ruge.</p>
<p>On the opposing side stood in the first instance <i>Kinkel</i> with his
immediate entourage — Schurz, Strodtmann, Schimmelpfennig, Techow etc.;
then came the former deputies and members of parliament, led by
<i>Reichenbach</i> with Meyen and Oppenheim as the representatives of
literature; and, lastly, Willich with his host which, however, remained in the
background. The roles were distributed as follows: Kinkel playing a
passion-flower represented the German Philistines in general; Reichenbach
playing a Count represented the bourgeoisie; Willich, playing Willich
represented the proletariat.</p>
<p>The first thing to say about August <i>Willich</i> is that Gustav always
felt secretly mistrustful of him because of his pointed skull signifying that
the enormous overgrowth of self-esteem had stunted all other qualities.</p>
<p>A German Philistine who once caught sight of ex-Lieutenant Willich in a
London pub snatched up his hat and fled exclaiming: My God, he looks just like
Jesus Christ! In order to increase the similarity Willich became a carpenter
for a while before the Revolution. Later on he emerged as a partisan leader in
the campaign in Baden and the Palatinate.</p>
<p>The partisan leader, a descendant of the old Italian condottiere is a
peculiar phenomenon of more recent wars, especially in Germany. The partisan
leader, accustomed to act on his own initiative, is reluctant to subordinate
himself to a more general command. His men owe their allegiance only to him,
but he is likewise wholly dependent on them. For this reason the discipline in
a free corps is somewhat arbitrary; according to circumstances it may be
savagely strict, but mostly it is extremely lax. The partisan leader cannot
always act the martinet, he must often flatter his men and win them over
individually with the aid of physical caresses; the normal military practices
are of little use here and boldness must be supplemented by other qualities if
the leader is to retain the respect of his subordinates. If he is not noble he
must at least have a noble consciousness to be complemented as always by
cunning, the talent for intrigue and a covert practical baseness. In this way
he not only wins over his soldiers but also bribes the inhabitants, surprises
the enemy and contrives matters so that even his opponents acknowledge his
strength of character. But all this does not suffice to hold together a free
corps whose members either come from the Lumpenproletariat or are soon
assimilated into it. What is needed in addition is a higher ideal. The partisan
leader must therefore have a nucleus of <i>idées fixes</i>, he must be a man
of principle in permanent pursuit of his mission to redeem the world. By means
of sermons at the front and sustained didactic propaganda he must impart a
consciousness of this higher ideal to every man individually and in this way he
will transform the whole troop into sons within the faith. If this higher ideal
is tinged with philosophy or mysticism or anything that surpasses normal
understanding, if it is something Hegelian by nature (as was the case with the
ideas that General Willisen <a href="notes.html#n62" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[62]</sup></a> tried to infuse into the Prussian army), then so
much the better. For this ensures that the noble consciousness will enter into
each and every partisan and the deeds of the whole corps thereby attain to a
speculative consecration which exalts them far above the level of ordinary
unreflecting courage and in any case the fame of such an army depends less on
its achievements than on its messianic calling. The strength of a corps can
only be enhanced if all the warriors are made to swear an oath that they will
not survive the destruction of the cause for which they are fighting and would
prefer to be massacred to the last man beneath the apple tree on the frontier
while singing a hymn. Of course, such a corps and such a leader inevitably feel
degraded by contact with ordinary profane soldiers and they will make every
effort either to keep at a distance from the army or else to shake off the
society of the uncircumcised. They hate nothing more than a large army and a
large war where their cunning buttressed by spiritual faith can achieve little
if the normal rules of war are disregarded. The partisan leader must then be a
crusader in the full sense of the word, he must be Peter the Hermit and Walther
von Habenichts <a href="notes.html#n63" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[63]</sup></a> rolled
into one. Faced with the heterogeneous elements and the informal mode of life
of his corps he must always uphold virtue. He must not allow his men to drink
him under the table and so he must only drink in solitude, for instance at
night in bed. If it should happen to him, as it might to any fallible human
being, that he find himself returning to barracks late at night after
inordinate indulgence in the pleasures of this life, he will take care not to
enter through the main gate, but to go round the side and climb over the wall
to avoid giving offence. Feminine charms should leave him cold, but it will
make a good impression if he, like Cromwell, takes his NCOs or a tailor's
apprentice into his bed from time to time. In general he cannot lead too strict
and ascetic a life. Behind the <i>cavalieri della ventura</i> in his corps
stand the <i>cavalieri del dente</i> <a href="notes.html#n64" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[64]</sup></a> who live mainly from requisitions and free
quarters to all of which Walther von Habenichts has to turn a blind eye so that
Peter the Hermit has always to be at hand with the consolation that such
unpleasant measures contribute to the salvation of the nation and so are in the
interest of the victims themselves.</p>
<p>All the qualities that the partisan leader must possess in wartime reappear
in peacetime in a modified form but one that can scarcely be regarded as an
improvement. Above all else he must preserve the core of the regiment for later
on and hence keep his recruiting officers in a state of constant activity. The
core consisting of the remnants of the free corps and the general mob of
<i>émigrés is</i> put into barracks either at government expense (as in
Besançon) or by some other means. The consecration in the service of an ideal
must not be lacking and it is provided by a barracks-communism that ascribes a
higher significance to the custom of holding ordinary civic actions in
contempt. As this communist barracks is no longer subject to the articles of
war, but only to the moral authority and the dictates of self-sacrifice, it is
inevitable that quarrels should break out over the communal funds. From these
disputes moral authority does not always emerge unscathed. If there is an
artisan’s club anywhere in the vicinity it can be employed as a
recruiting base and the artisans are given the prospect of a jolly life full of
adventures in exchange for the oppressive work of the present. By pointing to
the higher ethical significance of the barracks for the future of the
proletariat, it is even possible to induce the club to make financial
contributions. In both the barracks and the club the sermonising and the
patriarchal and gossipy style of personal relations will not fail to impress.
Even in peacetime the partisan does not lose his indispensable assurance and
just as in wartime every setback spurred him on to proclaim victory on the
morrow, so now he is for ever expounding on the moral certainty and the
philosophical inevitability with which <i>"it"</i> will start to happen
within the next fortnight. As he must needs have an enemy and as the noble man
is necessarily opposed by the ignoble ones he discovers in them a raging
hostility towards himself, he imagines that they hate him merely because of his
well-deserved popularity and would gladly poison him or stab him. With this in
mind he resolves always to conceal a long dagger beneath his pillow. Just as
the partisan leader in war will never succeed unless he assumes that the
population reveres him, likewise in peace he will not indeed manage to form any
lasting political groupings but he will constantly suppose them to exist and
from this all sorts of strange mystifications can arise. The talent for
requisitioning and obtaining free quarters appears again in the form of a cosy
parasitism. By contrast, the strict asceticism of our Orlando, like everything
that is good and great, is subject to terrible temptations in times of peace.
Boiardo says in Canto 24:</p>
<p class="indentb">Turpin behauptet, daß der Graf von Brava<br>
Jungfräulich war auf Lebenszeit und keusch.<br>
Glaubt ihr davon, was euch beliebt, ihr Herren — </p>
<p class="indentb">[Turpin claims that the Count of Brava <br>
Was virginal and chaste his whole life long. <br>
Of that you may believe, Sirs, what you will — ]</p>
<p class="fst">But we also learn that later on Count Brava lost his reason at
the sight of the beautiful Angelica and Astolf had to go to the moon to recover
it for him, as Master Lodovico Ariosto so charmingly narrates. Our modern
Orlando, however, mistook himself for the poet who tells how he, too, loved so
greatly that he lost his reason and tried to find it with his lips and hands on
the bosom of his Angelica and was thrown out of the house for his pains.</p>
<p>In politics the partisan leader will display his superiority in all matters
of tactics. In conformity with the notion of a partisan he will go from one
party to the next. Petty intrigues, sordid hole-and-corner activities, the
occasional lie, morally outraged perfidy will be the natural symptoms of the
noble consciousness. His faith in his mission and in the higher meaning of his
words and deeds will induce him to declare emphatically: "I never lie!" The
<i>idées fixes</i> become a splendid cloak for his secret treachery and cause
the simpletons of the Emigration, who have no ideas <i>at all</i>, to
conclude that he, the man of fixed ideas, is simply a fool. And our worthy
slyboots could desire nothing better.</p>
<p>Don Quixote and Sancho Panza rolled into one, as much in love with his
knapsack as with his <i>idées fixes</i>, with the free provisions of the
itinerant knight as much as with renown, Willich is the man of the duodecimal
<a href="notes.html#n65" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[65]</sup></a> war and the
microscopic intrigue. He conceals his cunning beneath the mask of character.
His real future lies in the prairies of the Rio Grande del Norte.</p>
<p>Concerning the relations between the two wings of the Emigration we have
described, a letter from Mr. Goegg in the <i>Deutsche Schnellpost</i> in New
York is very revealing:</p>
<p class="indentb">“They (the South Germans) resolved to bolster up the
reputation of the <i>moribund</i> central committee by attempting to unite
with the other factions. But there is little prospect of success for this well
intentioned idea. Kinkel continues to intrigue, has formed a committee
consisting of his rescuer, his biographer and a number of Prussian lieutenants.
Their aim is to work together in secret, to expand, if possible to gain
possession of the democratic funds, and then suddenly tear off their mask and
appear publicly as the powerful Kinkel party. This is neither honest nor just
nor sensible!”</p>
<p class="fst">The “honesty” of the intentions of the South Germans
can be seen from the following letter from Mr. Sigel to the same newspaper:</p>
<p class="indentb">“If we, the few men with <i>honourable</i>
intentions, have <i>in part</i> resorted to conspiracies, this is due to the
need to protect ourselves against the terrible perfidy and the presumptuousness
of Kinkel and his colleagues and to show them that they are not born to rule.
<i>Our chief aim</i> was to force Kinkel to come to a large meeting in order
to prove to him and to what he calls his close political friends that not all
that glitters is gold. The devil take the instrument” (i.e. Schurz),
“and the devil take the singer too” <a href="notes.html#n66" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[66]</sup></a> (i.e. Kinkel). (Weekly edition of the
<i>New-Yorker Deutsche Zeitung</i>, September 24 1851).</p>
<p class="fst">The strange constitution of the two factions that rebuke each
other for being “north” and “south” can be seen from
the fact that at the head of the South German elements stood the
“mind” of Ruge, while at the head of the North German side were the
“feelings” of Kinkel.</p>
<p>In order to understand the great struggle that was now waged we must waste a
few words on the diplomacy of these two world-shaking parties.</p>
<p>Arnold (and his henchmen likewise) was concerned above all to form a
“closed” society with the official <i>appearance</i> of
“revolutionary activity”. This society would then give birth to his
beloved “Committee for German Affairs” and this committee would
then propel Ruge into the European Central Committee. Arnold had been
indefatigable in his efforts to realise this aim since the summer of 1850. He
had hoped that the South Germans would provide “that happy medium where
he could dominate in comfort”. The official establishment of the
Emigration and the formation of committees was the necessary policy of Arnold
and his allies.</p>
<p>Kinkel and his cohorts, on the other hand, had to try and undermine
everything that could legitimise the position Ruge had usurped in the European
Central Committee. In reply to his appeal for an advance of £500 sterling
Kinkel had received the promise of some money from New Orleans, whereupon he
had formed a <i>secret finance committee</i> together with Willich,
Schimmelpfennig, Reichenbach, Techow and Schurz, etc. They reasoned: once we
have the money we shall have the Emigration; once we have the Emigration we
shall also have the government in Germany. Their aim, therefore, was to occupy
the whole Emigration with formal meetings but to undermine any attempt at
setting up an official society that went beyond a “loose
organisation” and above all to undermine all proposals to form
committees. This would delay the enemy faction, block their activities and
enable them to manoeuvre behind their backs.</p>
<p>Both parties, i.e. all the “distinguished men” had one thing in
common: they both led the mass of <i>émigrés</i> by the nose, they concealed
from them their real objectives, used them as mere tools and dropped them as
soon as they had served their purpose.</p>
<p>Let us take a look at these democratic Machiavellis, Talleyrands and
Metternichs and take note of their actions.</p>
<p><b><i>Scene 1.</i></b> July 14, 1851. — After a "“private
understanding with Kinkel to make common cause” had fallen through, Ruge,
Goegg, Sigel, Fickler and Ronge invited the distinguished men of all shades of
opinion to a meeting in Fickler’s home on July 14th. Twenty-six people
appeared. Fickler proposed that a “private circle” of German
refugees should be formed and this in turn would give birth to a
“business committee for the advancement of revolutionary
objectives”. This was opposed mainly by Kinkel and six of his supporters.
After a violent debate lasting several hours Fickler’s motion was passed
(16 votes to 10). Kinkel and the minority declared themselves unable to
participate any further and took their departure.</p>
<p><b><i>Scene 2.</i></b> July 20th. — The above majority constituted
itself as a society. Joined, among others, by Tausenau, who had been introduced
by Fickler.</p>
<p>If Ronge was the Luther and Kinkel the Melanchton then Tausenau is the
Abraham a Sancta Clara <a href="notes.html#n67" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[67]</sup></a> of the Gemman democrats. If the two augurs in
Cicero could not look each other in the face without laughing then Mr. Tausenau
cannot catch sight of his own earnest features in the mirror without bursting
into laughter. If Ruge had discovered in the Badeners people whom <i>he</i>
impressed, Fate now had its revenge when it introduced him to the Austrian
Tausenau, a man who impressed him.</p>
<p>At the suggestion of Goegg and Tausenau the negotiations were postponed in
order to try once again to bring about a union with Kinkel's faction.</p>
<p><b><i>Scene 3.</i></b> July 27th. — Session in the Cranbourne Hotel.
The “distinguished” Emigration there to a man. Kinkel's group
appeared but not with the intention of joining the society already in
existence; on the contrary, they pressed for the formation of an “open
discussion club <i>without</i> a business committee and without <i>definite
objectives”.</i> Schurz who acted as Kinkel's mentor throughout all
these parliamentary negotiations, proposed:</p>
<p class="indentb">“The present company should form itself into a private
political society with the name German Émigré Club and should accept as new
members other citizens from among the German refugees on the nomination of a
member and after a majority vote in favour.”</p>
<p class="fst">Passed unanimously. The society resolved to meet every
Friday.</p>
<p class="indentb">“The passing of this motion was welcomed with general
applause and with the cry: ‘Long live the German republic!!!’
Everyone felt that they had done their duty by being generally open-minded and
that they had achieved something positive serving the cause of
revolution.” (Goegg, Weekly edition of the <i>Deutsche Schnellpost</i>,
August 20, 1851.)</p>
<p class="fst">Eduard Meyen was so delighted with this success that he waxed
ecstatic in his lithographed report:</p>
<p class="indentb">“The whole Emigration now form a coherent phalanx up
to and including Bucher and with the sole exception of the incorrigible Marx
clique.”</p>
<p class="fst">This same notice of Meyen’s can be found also in the
<i>Berliner lithographische Korrespondenz.</i></p>
<p>In this way, thanks to a general open-mindedness and to the accompaniment of
three cheers for the German Republic the great Émigré Club which was to hold
such inspiring meetings and which was to dissolve in satisfaction a few weeks
after Kinkel’s departure for America, came into being. Its dissolution
did not of course prevent it from playing an important part as a living entity
in America.</p>
<p><b><i>Scene 4.</i></b> August 1st. — Second meeting in the
Cranbourne Hotel.</p>
<p class="indentb">“Unfortunately we must already report today that the
expectations raised by the formation of this club have been sadly
disappointed.” (Goegg, <i>loc. cit.</i>, August 27th.)</p>
<p class="fst">Kinkel introduced six Prussian refugees and six Prussian
visitors to the Great Exhibition into the club without obtaining a majority
decision. <i>Damm</i> (President, former president of the Baden Constituent
Assembly) expressed his astonishment at this treacherous infringement of the
statutes. [“Damm is here!” “Who is here?” “Damm
is here!” “Who?” “Damm, Damm, surely you know
Damm?”]</p>
<p>Kinkel explained: “The Club is only a <i>loosely</i> organised
society with no other purpose than for people to get to know each other and to
have discussions that are open to everyone. It is therefore desirable for
visitors to be admitted to the Club in large numbers.”</p>
<p>Student Schurz attempted to cover up quickly for the Professor’s lack
of tact by moving an amendment to permit the admission of visitors. Motion
passed. Abraham a Sancta Clara Tausenau rose and put the two following motions
with a perfectly straight face:</p>
<p class="indentb">“1. A commission <i>(the</i> committee)
‘should be set up to report weekly on current affairs, particularly in
Germany. These reports are to be preserved in the archive of the Club and
published at an appropriate time. 2. There should be a commission <i>(the</i>
committee) to deposit in the archive all possible details concerning violations
of the law and acts of cruelty towards the supporters of democracy committed by
the servants of the reaction during the last three years and at the present
time.’</p>
<p class="indentb">“Reichenbach opposed this vigorously: ‘He saw
suspicious motives lurking behind these seemingly harmless proposals and also
the wish to use the election of the members of this commission as a device to
give the Club an official character not desired by himself or his
friends.’</p>
<p class="indentb">“Schimmelpfennig and Schurz: ‘These commissions
could arrogate powers unto themselves that might be of a conspiratorial nature
and gradually lead to an <i>official</i> committee.’</p>
<p class="indentb">“Meyer: ‘I want words, not
deeds.’”</p>
<p class="fst">According to Goegg's account the majority seemed inclined to
accept the motion; Machiavelli Schurz proposed an adjournment. Abraham a Sancta
Clara Tausenau agreed to the proposal so as not to seem unfriendly. Kinkel
expressed the opinion that the vote should be postponed until the next meeting
chiefly because his supporters were in the minority that evening and so he and
his friends would be unable in the circumstances to regard the vote as
“binding <i>on their conscience”.</i> Adjournment agreed.</p>
<p><b><i>Scene 5.</i></b> August 8th. — Third meeting in the Cranbourne
Hotel. Discussion of the Tausenau motions. — Ignoring the agreement,
Kinkel/Willich had brought along the “rank and file refugees”,
<i>le menu peuple, </i>so as to “bind their consciences” this
time. — Schurz moved an amendment proposing voluntary lectures on current
affairs and in accordance with a previous arrangement Meyen immediately
volunteered to speak on Prussia, Schurz on France, Oppenheim on England and
Kinkel on America and the future (since his immediate future lay in America).
Tausenau's proposals were rejected. He declared movingly that his only wish was
to sacrifice his just anger on the altar of the nation and to remain within the
bosom of his allies. But the Ruge/Fickler contingent at once assumed the
outraged indignation of beautiful souls who have been swindled.</p>
<p><i><b>Intermezzo.</b> —</i> Kinkel had finally received £160
sterling from New Orleans and together with other distinguished heroes he had
set about investing it for the revolution. The Ruge/Fickler faction, already
embittered by the recent vote, now learned of this. They had no time to lose,
action was essential. They founded a new cesspool and concealed its foul
stagnation under the name of the <i>Agitation Club.</i> Its members were
Tausenau, Frank, Goegg, Sigel, Hertle, Ronge, Haug, Fickler and Ruge. The Club
immediately announced in the English press:</p>
<p class="indentb">“Its aims are not to discuss but to work, it would
produce not words but deeds and above all it appeals to likeminded comrades to
make donations. The Agitation Club appoints Tausenau to be its executive leader
and its foreign minister. It also recognises Ruge's position in the European
Central Committee” (as Imperial Administrator) <a href="notes.html#n68" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[68]</sup></a> “as well as his
previous activity on behalf of and in the name of the German people.”</p>
<p class="fst">The new combination does not conceal the original constellation:
Ruge, Ronge and Haug. After the struggles and the efforts of so many years Ruge
had finally reached his goal: he was acknowledged to be the fifth wheel on the
central carriage of democracy and had a clearly — all too clearly —
defined part of the people behind him, consisting of eight men in all. But even
this pleasure was poisoned for him as his recognition was purchased at the cost
of an indirect slight and was agreed to only on the condition imposed by the
peasant Fickler that Ruge should henceforth cease to “broadcast his
rubbish to the whole world”.</p>
<p>The coarse Fickler regarded as “distinguished” only those
writings by Ruge which he had not read and did not need to read.</p>
<p><b><i>Scene 6.</i></b> August 22nd. — The Cranbourne Hotel. Firstly,
there was a “diplomatic masterstroke” (vide Goegg) on the part of
Schurz: he proposed the formation of a general refugee committee to comprise
six members taken from the different factions together with five co-opted
members of the already existing refugee committee of the Willich Artisan Club.
(This would have given the Kinkel/Willich wing a permanent majority). Agreed.
The elections were carried out but rejected by the members of the Rugean part
of the state, which meant the complete collapse of the diplomatic master
stroke. How seriously this refugee committee was meant to be taken can be seen
from the fact that four days later Willich resigned from the committee of
artisans and refugees which had only had a nominal existence for a long time,
following upon repeated, wholly disrespectful revolts on the part of the
“rank and file refugees” which had made the dissolution of the
committee an inevitability. — Interpellation concerning the emergence in
public of the Agitation Club. Motion: that the Émigré Club should have nothing
to do with the Agitation Club and should publicly dissociate itself from all
its actions. Furious attacks on the “Agitators” Goegg and Sigel
junior (i.e. senior, see below) in their presence. Rudolph Schramm declared
that his old friend Ruge was a minion of Mazzini and a “gossipy old
woman”. <i>Tu quoque, Brute!</i> Goegg retorted, not as a great orator
but as an honest citizen and he launched a bitter attack on the ambiguous,
slack, perfidious, unctuous Kinkel.</p>
<p class="indentb">“It is irresponsible to prevent those who wish to work
from doing so, but these people want a fictitious, inactive union that they can
use as a cover for certain purposes.”</p>
<p class="fst">When Goegg referred to the public announcement about the
Agitator Club in the English papers Kinkel arose majestically and said that
“He already controlled the whole American press and had taken steps to
ensure his control of the French press too.”</p>
<p>The motion of the German faction was passed and provoked a declaration from
“the Agitators” that the members of their club could no longer
remain within the Émigré Club.</p>
<p>Thus arose the terrible gulf between the Émigré Club and the Agitators' Club
which gapes through the whole history of the modern world.</p>
<p>The most curious fact about it is that both creatures only survived until
their separation and now they vegetate in the Kaulbachian <a href="notes.html#n69" target=_blank><sup class="enote">[69]</sup></a> battle of the ghosts that still rages in
German-American meetings and papers and no doubt will continue to rage to the
end of time.</p>
<p>The whole session was all the more stormy as the undisciplined Schramm went
so far as to attack Willich, claiming that the <i>Émigré</i> Club degraded
itself by its connections with that knight. The chairman, who happened to be
the timorous Meyen, had already lost control several times in despair. But the
debate about the Agitators' Club and the resignation of its members brought the
tumult to a climax. To the accompaniment of shouts, drumming, crashes, threats
and raging the edifying meeting went on until 2 a.m. when the landlord turned
off the gas and so plunged the heated antagonists into darkness. This brought
all plans to save the nation to an abrupt end.</p>
<p>At the end of August the chivalrous Willich and the cosy Kinkel made an
attempt to smash the Agitators' Club by putting a proposal to the worthy
Fickler.</p>
<p class="indentb">“He should join with them and their closer political friends
in forming a Finance Committee to manage the money that had come in from New
Orleans. This committee should continue to function until it is
superseded by a general finance committee of the&lt; revolution. However,
the acceptance of this offer would imply the dissolution of all German
revolutionary and agitatorial societies that had existed hitherto.”</p>
<p class="fst">The worthy Fickler rejected the idea of this “imposed, secret
and irresponsible committee” with indignation.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="indentb">“How”, he exclaimed, “can a mere finance committee hope to
unite all the revolutionary parties around it? The money that has arrived and

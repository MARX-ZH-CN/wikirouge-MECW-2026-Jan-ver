<p class="title">Revolution and Counter-revolution in Germany</p>
<h1>IV. <br>
Austria.</h1>
<h5>NOVEMBER 7th, 1851.</h5>
<p class="fst">WE have now to consider Austria: that country which, up to
March, 1848, was sealed up to the eyes of foreign nations almost as much as
China before the late war with England.</p>
<p>As a matter of course, we can here take into consideration nothing but
German Austria. The affairs of the Polish, Hungarian, or Italian Austrians do
not belong to our subject, and as far as they, since 1848, have influenced the
fate of the German Austrians, they will have to be taken into account
hereafter.</p>
<p>The Government of Prince Metternich turned upon two hinges; firstly, to keep
every one of the different nations subjected to the Austrian rule, in check, by
all other nations similarly conditioned; secondly, and this always has been the
fundamental principle of absolute monarchies, to rely for support upon two
classes, the feudal landlords and the large stockjobbing capitalists; and to
balance, at the same time, the influence and power of either of these classes
by that of the other, so as to leave full independence of action to the
Government. The landed nobility, whose entire income consisted in feudal
revenues of all sorts, could not but support a Government which proved their
only protection against that down-trodden class of serfs upon whose spoils they
lived; and whenever the less wealthy portion of them, as in Galicia, in 1846,
rose in opposition against the Government, Metternich in an instant let loose
upon them these very serfs, who at any rate profited by the occasion to wreak a
terrible vengeance upon their more immediate oppressors. On the other hand, the
large capitalists of the Exchange were chained to Metternich's Government by
the vast share they had in the public funds of the country. Austria, restored
to her full power in 1815 restoring and maintaining in Italy Absolute Monarchy
ever since 1820, freed from part of her liabilities by the bankruptcy of 1810,
had, after the peace, very soon re-established her credit in the great European
money markets; and in proportion as her credit grew, she had drawn against it.
Thus all the large European moneydealers had engaged considerable portions of
their capital in the Austrian funds; they all of them were interested in
upholding the credit of that country, and as Austrian public credit, in order
to be upheld, ever required new loans, they were obliged from time to time to
advance new capital in order to keep up the credit of the securities for that
which they already had advanced. The long peace after 1815, and the apparent
impossibility of a thousand years old empire, like Austria, being upset,
increased the credit of Metternich's Government in a wonderful ratio, and made
it even independent of the good will of the Vienna bankers and stock-jobbers;
for as long as Metternich could obtain plenty of money at Frankfort and
Amsterdam, he had, of course, the satisfaction of seeing the Austrian
capitalists at his feet. They were, besides, in every other respect at his
mercy: the large profits which bankers, stock-jobbers, and Government
contractors always contrive to draw out of an absolute monarchy, were
compensated for by the almost unlimited power which the Government possessed
over their persons and fortunes; and not the smallest shadow of an opposition
was, therefore, to be expected from this quarter. Thus Metternich was sure of
the support of the two most powerful and influential classes of the empire, and
he possessed besides an army and a bureaucracy, which for all purposes of
absolutism could not be better constituted. The civil and military officers in
the Austrian service form a race of their own; their fathers have been in the
service of the Kaiser, and so will their sons be; they belong to none of the
multifarious nationalities congregated under the wing of the double-headed
eagle; they are, and ever have been, removed from one end of the empire to the
other, from Poland to Italy, from Germany to Transylvania; Hungarian, Pole,
German, Roumanian, Italian, Croat, every individual not stamped with "imperial
and royal authority," etc., bearing a separate national character, is equally
despised by them; they have no nationality, or rather, they alone make up the
really Austrian nation. It is evident what a pliable, and at the same time
powerful instrument, in the hands of an intelligent and energetic chief, such a
civil and military hierarchy must be.</p>
<p>As to the other classes of the population, Metternich, in the true spirit of
a statesman of the <i>ancien regime,</i> cared little for their support. He
had, with regard to them, but one policy: to draw as much as possible out of
them in the shape of taxation, and at the same time, to keep them quiet. The
trading and manufacturing middle class was but of slow growth in Austria. The
trade of the Danube was comparatively unimportant; the country possessed but
one port, Trieste, and the trade of the port was very limited. As to the
manufacturers, they enjoyed considerable protection, amounting even in most
cases to the complete exclusion of all foreign competition; but this advantage
had been granted to them principally with a view to increase their tax-paying
capabilities, and was in a high degree counterpoised by internal restrictions
on manufactures, privileges on guilds, and other feudal corporations, which
were scrupulously upheld as long as they did not impede the purposes and views
of the Government. The petty tradesmen were encased in the narrow bounds of
these Mediaeval guilds, which kept the different trades in a perpetual war of
privilege against each other, and at the same time, by all but excluding
individuals of the working class from the possibility of raising themselves in
the social scale, gave a sort of hereditary stability to the members of those
involuntary associations. Lastly, the peasant and the working man were treated
as mere taxable matter, and the only care that was taken of them was to keep
them as much as possible in the same conditions of life in which they then
existed, and in which their fathers had existed before them. For this purpose
every old, established, hereditary authority was upheld in the same manner as
that of the State: the authority of the landlord over the petty tenant farmer,
that of the manufacturer over the operative, of the small master over the
journeyman and apprentice, of the father over the son, was everywhere rigidly
maintained by the Government, and every branch of disobedience punished the
same as a transgression of the law, by that universal instrument of Austrian
justice—the stick.</p>
<p>Finally, to wind up into one comprehensive system all these attempts at
creating an artificial stability, the intellectual food allowed to the nation
was selected with the minutest caution, and dealt out as sparingly as possible.
Education was everywhere in the hands of the Catholic priesthood, whose chiefs,
in the same manner as the large feudal landowners, were deeply interested in
the conservation of the existing system. The universities were organized in a
manner which allowed them to produce nothing but special men, that might or
might not obtain great proficiency in sundry particular branches of knowledge,
but which, at all events, excluded that universal liberal education which other
universities are expected to impart. There was absolutely no newspaper press,
except in Hungary, and the Hungarian papers were prohibited in all other parts
of the monarchy. As to general literature, its range had not widened for a
century; it had narrowed again after the death of Joseph II. And all around the
frontier, where ever the Austrian States touched upon a civilized country, a
cordon of literary censors was established in connection with the cordon of
customhouse officials, preventing any foreign book or newspaper from passing
into Austria before its contents had been twice or three times thoroughly
sifted, and found pure of even the slightest contamination of the malignant
spirit of the age.</p>
<p>For about thirty years after 1815 this system worked with wonderful success.
Austria remained almost unknown to Europe, and Europe was quite as little known
in Austria. The social state of every class of the population, and of the
population as a whole, appeared not to have undergone the slightest change.
Whatever rancour there might exist from class to class—and the existence
of this rancour was for Metternich a principal condition of government, which
he even fostered by making the higher classes the instruments of all Government
exactions, and thus throwing the odium upon them—whatever hatred the
people might bear to the inferior officials of the State, there existed, upon
the whole, little or no dissatisfaction with the Central Government. The
Emperor was adored, and old Francis I. seemed to be borne out by facts when,
doubting of the durability of this system, he complacently added: "And yet it
will hold while I live, and Metternich."</p>
<p>But there was a slow underground movement going on which baffled all
Metternich's efforts. The wealth and influence of the manufacturing and trading
middle class increased. The introduction of machinery and steam-power in
manufactures upset in Austria, as it had done everywhere else, the old
relations and vital conditions of whole classes of society: it changed serfs
into free men, small farmers into manufacturing operatives; it undermined the
old feudal trades corporations, and destroyed the means of existence of many of
them. The new commercial and manufacturing population came everywhere into
collision with the old feudal institutions. The middle classes, more and more
induced by their business to travel abroad, introduced some mythical knowledge
of the civilized countries situated beyond the Imperial line of customs; the
introduction of railways finally accelerated both the industrial and
intellectual movement. There was, too, a dangerous part in the Austrian State
establishment, viz., the Hungarian feudal Constitution, with its parliamentary
proceedings, and its struggles of the impoverished and oppositional mass of the
nobility against the Government and its allies, the magnates. Presburg, the
seat of the Diet, was at the very gates of Vienna. All the elements contributed
to create among the middle classes of the towns a spirit, not exactly of
opposition, for opposition was as yet impossible, but of discontent; a general
wish for reforms, more of an administrative than of a constitutional nature.
And in the same manner as in Prussia, a portion of the bureaucracy joined the
bourgeoisie. Among this hereditary caste of officials the traditions of Joseph
II. were not forgotten: the more educated functionaries of the Government, who
themselves sometimes meddled with imaginary possible reforms, by far preferred
the progressive and intellectual despotism of that Emperor to the "paternal"
despotism of Metternich. A portion of the poorer nobility equally sided with
the middle class, and as to the lower classes of the population, who always had
found plenty of grounds to complain of their superiors, if not of the
Government, they in most cases could not but adhere to the reformatory wishes
of the bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>It was about this time, say 1843 or 1844, that a particular branch of
literature, agreeable to this change, was established in Germany. A few
Austrian writers, novelists, literary critics, bad poets, the whole of them of
very indifferent ability, but gifted with that peculiar industrialism proper to
the Jewish race, established themselves in Leipsig and other German towns out
of Austria, and there, out of the reach of Metternich, published a number of
books and pamphlets on Austrian affairs. They and their publishers made "a
roaring trade" of it. All Germany was eager to become initiated into the
secrets of the policy of European China; and the Austrians themselves, who
obtained these publications by the wholesale smuggling carried on upon the
Bohemian frontier, were still more curious. Of course, the secrets let out in
these publications were of no great importance, and the reform plans schemed
out by their well-wishing authors bore the stamp of an innocuousness almost
amounting to political virginity. A Constitution and a free press for Austria
were things considered unattainable; administrative reforms, extension of the
rights of the Provincial Diets, admission of foreign books and newspapers, and
a less severe censorship—the loyal and humble desires of these good
Austrians did hardly go any farther.</p>
<p>At all events the growing impossibility of preventing the literary
intercourse of Austria with the rest of Germany, and through Germany with the
rest of the world, contributed much toward the formation of an
anti-governmental public opinion, and brought at least some little political
information within the reach of part of the Austrian population. Thus, by the
end of 1847, Austria was seized, although in an inferior degree, by that
political and politico-religious agitation which then prevailed in all Germany;
and if its progress in Austria was more silent, it did, nevertheless, find
revolutionary elements enough to work upon. There was the peasant, serf, or
feudal tenant, ground down into the dust by lordly or Government exactions;
then the factory operative, forced by the stick of the policeman to work upon
any terms the manufacturer chose to grant; then the journeyman, debarred by the
corporative laws from any chance of gaining an independence in his trade; then
the merchant, stumbling at every step in business over absurd regulations; then
the manufacturer, in uninterrupted conflict with trade-guilds, jealous of their
privileges, or with greedy and meddling officials; then the school-master, the
<i>savant,</i> the better educated functionary, vainly struggling against an
ignorant and presumptuous clergy, or a stupid and dictating superior. In short,
there was not a single class satisfied, for the small concessions Government
was obliged now and then to make were not made at its own expense, for the
treasury could not afford that, but at the expense of the high aristocracy and
clergy; and as to the great bankers, and fundholders, the late events in Italy,
the increasing opposition of the Hungarian Diet, and the unwonted spirit of
discontent and cry for reform, manifesting themselves all over the Empire, were
not of a nature to strengthen their faith in the solidity and solvency of the
Austrian Empire.</p>
<p>Thus Austria, too, was marching slowly but surely toward a mighty change,
when, of a sudden, an event broke out in France, which at once brought down the
impending storm, and gave the lie to old Francis's assertion, that the building
would hold out both during his and Metternich's lifetime.</p>

<h1>IX. <br>
Panslavism — The Schleswig-Holstein War.</h1>
<h5>MARCH 15th, 1852.</h5>
<p class="fst">BOHEMIA and Croatia (another disjected member of the Slavonic
family, acted upon by the Hungarian, as Bohemia by the German) were the homes
of what is called on the European continent "Panslavism." Neither Bohemia nor
Croatia was strong enough to exist as a nation by herself. Their respective
nationalities, gradually undermined by the action of historical causes that
inevitably absorbs into a more energetic stock, could only hope to be restored
to anything like independence by an alliance with other Slavonic nations. There
were twenty-two millions of Poles, forty-five millions of Russians, eight
millions of Serbians and Bulgarians; why not form a mighty confederation of the
whole eighty millions of Slavonians, and drive back or exterminate the intruder
upon the holy Slavonic soil, the Turk, the Hungarian, and above all the hated,
but indispensable <i>Niemetz,</i> the German? Thus in the studies of a few
Slavonian <i>dilettanti</i> of historical science was this ludicrous, this
anti-historical movement got up, a movement which intended nothing less than to
subjugate the civilized West under the barbarian East, the town under the
country, trade, manufactures, intelligence, under the primitive agriculture of
Slavonian serfs. But behind this ludicrous theory stood the terrible reality of
the Russian Empire; that empire which by every movement proclaims the
pretension of considering all Europe as the domain of the Slavonic race, and
especially of the only energetic part of this race, of the Russians; that
empire which, with two capitals such as St. Peterburg and Moscow, has not yet
found its centre of gravity, as long as the "City of the Czar" (Constantinople,
called in Russian Tzarigrad, the Czar's city), considered by every Russian
peasant as the true metropolis of his religion and his nation, is not actually
the residence of its Emperor; that empire which, for the last one hundred and
fifty years, has never lost, but always gained territory by every war it has
commenced. And well known in Central Europe are the intrigues by which Russian
policy supported the new-fangled system of Panslavism, a system than which none
better could be invented to suit its purposes. Thus, the Bohemian and Croatian
Panslavists, some intentionally, some without knowing it, worked in the direct
interest of Russia; they betrayed the revolutionary cause for the shadow of a
nationality which, in the best of cases, would have shared the fate of the
Polish nationality under Russian sway. It must, however, be said for the honor
of the Poles, that they never got to be seriously entangled in these Panslavist
traps, and if a few of the aristocracy turned furious Panslavists, they knew
that by Russian subjugation they had less to lose than by a revolt of their own
peasant serfs.</p>
<p>The Bohemians and Croatians called, then, a general Slavonic Congress at
Prague, for the preparation of the universal Slavonian Alliance. This Congress
would have proved a decided failure even without the interference of the
Austrian military. The several Slavonic languages differ quite as much as the
English, the German, and the Swedish, and when the proceedings opened, there
was no common Slavonic tongue by which the speakers could make themselves
understood. French was tried, but was equally unintelligible to the majority,
and the poor Slavonic enthusiasts, whose only common feeling was a common
hatred against the Germans, were at last obliged to express themselves in the
hated German language, as the only one that was generally understood! But just
then another Slavonic Congress was assembling in Prague, in the shape of
Galician lancers, Croatian and Slovak grenadiers, and Bohemian gunners and
cuirassiers; and this real, armed Slavonic Congress, under the command of
Windischgratz, in less than twenty-four hours drove the founders of an
imaginary Slavonian supremacy out of the town, and dispersed them to the
winds.</p>
<p>The Bohemian, Moravian, Dalmatian, and part of the Polish deputies (the
aristocracy) to the Austrian Constituent Diet, made in that Assembly a
systematic war upon the German element. The Germans, and part of the Poles (the
impoverished nobility), were in this Assembly the chief supporters of
revolutionary progress; the mass of the Slavonic deputies, in opposing them,
were not satisfied with thus showing clearly the reactionary tendencies of
their entire movement, but they were degraded enough to tamper and conspire
with the very same Austrian Government which had dispersed their meeting at
Prague. They, too, were paid for this infamous conduct; after supporting the
Government during the insurrection of October, 1848, an event which finally
secured to them a majority in the Diet, this now almost exclusively Slavonic
Diet was dispersed by Austrian soldiers, the same as the Prague Congress, and
the Panslavists threatened with imprisonment if they should stir again. And
they have only obtained this, that Slavonic nationality is now being everywhere
undermined by Austrian centralization, a result for which they may thank their
own fanaticism and blindness.</p>
<p>If the frontiers of Hungary and Germany had admitted of any doubt, there
would certainly have been another quarrel there. But, fortunately, there was no
pretext, and the interests of both nations being intimately related, they
struggled against the same enemies, viz., the Austrian Government and the
Panslavistic fanaticism. The good understanding was not for a moment disturbed.
But the Italian Revolution entangled at least a part of Germany in an
internecine war, and it must be stated here, as a proof how far the
Metternichian system had succeeded in keeping back the development of the
public mind, that during the first six months of 1848, the same men that had in
Vienna mounted the barricades, went, full of enthusiasm, to join the army that
fought against the Italian patriots. This deplorable confusion of ideas did
not, however, last long.</p>
<p>Lastly, there was the war with Denmark about Schleswig and Holstein. These
countries, unquestionably German by nationality, language and predilection, are
also from military, naval and commercial grounds necessary to Germany. Their
inhabitants have, for the last three years, struggled hard against Danish
intrusion. The right of treaties, besides, was for them. The Revolution of
March brought them into open collision with the Danes, and Germany supported
them. But while in Poland, in Italy, in Bohemia, and later on, in Hungary,
military operations were pushed with the utmost vigor, in this the only
popular, the only, at least partially, revolutionary war, a system of
resultless marches and counter-marches was adopted, and an interference of
foreign diplomacy was submitted to, which led, after many an heroic engagement,
to a most miserable end. The German Government betrayed, during the war, the
Schleswig-Holstein revolutionary army on every occasion, and allowed it
purposely to be cut up, when dispersed or divided, by the Danes. The German
corps of volunteers were treated the same.</p>
<p>But while thus the German name earned nothing but hatred on every side, the
German Constitutional and Liberal Governments rubbed their hands for joy. They
had succeeded in crushing the Polish and the Bohemian movements. They had
everywhere revived the old national animosities, which heretofore had prevented
any common understanding and action between the German, the Pole, the Italian.
They had accustomed the people to scenes of civil war and repression by the
military. The Prussian army had regained its confidence in Poland, the Austrian
army in Prague; and while the superabundant patriotism <i>("die Patriotische
Ueberkraft,"</i> as Heine has it) of revolutionary but short-sighted youth was
led in Schleswig and Lombardy, to be crushed by the grape-shot of the enemy,
the regular army, the real instrument of action, both of Prussia and Austria,
was placed in a position to regain public favor by victories over the
foreigner. But we repeat: these armies, strengthened by the Liberals as a means
of action against the more advanced party, no sooner had recovered their
self-confidence and their discipline in some degree, than they turned
themselves against the Liberals, and restored to power the men of the old
system. When Radetzky, in his camp beyond the Adige, received the first orders
from the "responsible ministers" at Vienna, he exclaimed: "Who are these
ministers? They are not the Government of Austria! Austria is now nowhere but
in my camp; I and my army, we are Austria; and when we shall have beaten the
Italians we shall reconquer the Empire for the Emperor!" And old Radetzky was
right&amp;ndash;but the imbecile "responsible" ministers at Vienna heeded him
not.</p>

<h4>[London,] 27 June 1867</h4>
<p>Dear <strong>Fred</strong>,</p>
<p>The 2 half £5-notes received with kindest thanks. With respect to the address, use <i>Borkheim. </i>He knows my situation, though with as much concealment as I consider necessary in his regard. I would even like him to know that you are lending me money. But you must write and tell me <i>when </i>the money is to be sent to him. I do not see why I should involve yet a 3rd philistine.</p>
<p>The <i>Fenians</i> should be delivered to you today.</p>
<p>I was so very pleased by your lines of yesterday, and that requires no further elaboration from me.</p>
<p>Sheet 20 <span class="context">[of the first volume of <i>Capital</i>]</span> was the latest to reach me. It will probably run to 40 or 42 sheets in all. I've <i>not</i> as yet received <i>any</i> <i>corrected proofs </i>after the ones already sent you. On your departure send me back those which are in your possession.</p>
<p>Regarding the objection that you mentioned the philistines and vulgar economists will infallibly raise (they forget, of course, that, if they reckon <i>paid labour</i> as <i>wages, </i>they are reckoning <i>unpaid</i> labour as <i>profit</i>, etc.), it amounts, in scientific terms, to the following question:</p>
<p><i>How </i>is the <i>value </i>of the commodity <i>transformed</i> into its <i>price of production</i> in which</p>
<p class="fst">1. the<i> whole of the labour appears paid for</i> in the form of <i>wages;</i></p>
<p class="fst">2. the surplus-labour, however, or the surplus-value, assumes the form of an <i>addition to the price, </i>and goes by the name of interest, profit, etc., <i>over and above </i>the <i>cost-price </i>(= price of the constant part of capital + wages).</p>
<p>Answering this question presupposes:</p>
<p class="fst">I. That the <i>transformation</i> of, for example, the <i>value of a day’s labour-power </i>into<i> wages or the price of a day’s labour</i> has been explained. This is done in <i>Chapter V</i> of this volume.</p>
<p class="fst">II. That the <i>transformation of surplus-value</i> into <i>profit</i>, and of <i>profit into average profit</i>, etc., has been explained. This presupposes that the <i>process of the circulation of capital </i>has been previously explained, since the turnover of capital, etc., plays a part here. This matter cannot therefore be treated prior to the 3rd book <i>(Volume II </i>is to contain books 2 and 3). Here it will be shown how the philistines’ and vulgar economists’ <i>manner of conceiving things</i> arises, namely, because the only thing that is ever reflected in their minds is the immediate <i>form of appearance </i>of relations, and not their <i>inner connection</i>. Incidentally, if the latter were the case, we would surely have no need of <i>science </i>at all.</p>
<p>Now if I wished to <i>refute</i> all such objections in <i>advance, </i>I should spoil the whole dialectical method of exposition. On the contrary, the good thing about this method is that it is constantly <i>setting traps</i> for those fellows which will provoke them into an untimely display of their idiocy.</p>
<p>By the by, Para. 3: ‘<i>The Rate of Surplus Value’,</i> which was the last one you had in your possession, is immediately followed by the Para.: ‘<i>The Working Day’ </i>(struggle for the reduction of working time), whose argument demonstrates <i>ad oculus </i>to what extent those bourgeois gentlemen comprehend the source and nature of their profit in <i>practice. </i>This is also shown in the <i>Senior </i><strong>case</strong>, where your bourgeois assures us that his whole profit and interest derive from the <i>last unpaid hour of labour.</i></p>
<p>Kindest regards to <strong>Mrs</strong> Lizzy.</p>
<p class="sig">Your<br>
K. M.</p>
<p>You must stop over for a few days here on your journey home.</p>
<p>Apropos. I judged it in every way imprudent to take Mr <i>Meissner </i>into my confidence regarding my private circumstances.</p>

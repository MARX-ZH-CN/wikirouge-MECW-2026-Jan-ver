<p class="fst">Dear Moor,</p>
<p class="fst">I am returning the encl. letters.</p>
<p>So yesterday morning the Tories, by the hand of Mr. Colcraft, accomplished the final act of separation between England and Ireland. The <i>only thing </i>that the Fenians still lacked were martyrs. They have been provided with these by Derby and G. Hardy. Only the execution of the three <span class="context">[Michael Larkin, William Allen and Michael O'Brien]</span> has made the liberation of Kelly and Deasy the heroic deed as which it will now be sung to every Irish babe in the cradle in Ireland, England and America. The Irish women will do that just as well as the Polish women.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, the only time that anybody has been executed for a similar matter in a civilised country was the case of John Brown at Harpers Ferry. The Fenians could not have wished for a better precedent. The Southerners had at least the decency to treat J. Brown as a <i>rebel, </i>whereas here everything is being done to transform a political attempt into a common crime.</p>

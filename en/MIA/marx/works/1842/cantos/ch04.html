<p class="title">The Insolently Threatened Yet Miraculously Rescued Bible</p>
<h1>Canto The Fourth</h1>
<p class="verse">
What do I see! Saint <i>John</i>, illuminate my vision,<br>
So that your poetry’s power may lend me inspiration.<br>
Whose holy eyes saw Angel <i>Michael</i> in the fight<br>
With the great dragon, fill, O fill my soul with light!<br>
What do I see! It’s drawing nigh, the day of doom,<br>
The battles’ last that bears destruction in its womb.<br>
I see the whole horizon bounded by a ring<br>
Of cloud that slowly lifts, at first unhurrying,<br>
Then swiftly, like the lion greedy for his prey,<br>
Springs forward. All the hounds of Hell speed on their way,<br>
Hissing through misty cloud. Their tails, ablaze with fire,<br>
Whip all around and lash to shreds the very air.<br>
In a wild witches’ dance with greedy rage they spin,<br>
Yelling with fury, mad to appease the wrath within.<br>
What do I see! You mount Heav'n’s heights, accursed race?<br>
May you unpunished go along the Almighty’s ways?<br>
You wield the lightning, hold the thunder in your hand?<br>
Ah, it’s the desperate man of <i>Bonn</i> that leads your band!<br>
But see, God’s mercy ever watches from afar,<br>
And when all ends, it shall be with a Gloria.<br>
       Consumed with rage, the forces of the Free draw near; <br>
Soon, soon God’s might shall turn their arrogance to fear. <br>
They come, a seething mass. As <i>Wigand</i> sails along, <br>
The others follow him, a roaring, snorting throng. <br>
To <i>Leipzig</i> city he is leading one and all,<br>
The “<i>Gutenberg</i>” he’s chosen as his arsenal.<br>
Many a bastion’s piled up high with bulging bales,<br>
Rampart and trench are dug for when the foe assails.<br>
Four ravelins are stacked up high with Bauer’s writings,<br>
With guns galore to give protection to the curtains.<br>
Many a text of <i>Köppen’s</i> Friedrich lies there,<br>
Many a page of <i>Annals</i> from a long-past year.<br>
The Trumpet <i>Feuerbach</i>, in heavy bundles bound,<br>
Are stacked in serried rows to ring the fortress round.<br>
And as <i>cheval de fate, </i>there’s Ruge’s <i>Novelist,</i><br>
To mop the sweat up, there’s <i>The Faded Pietist.'</i><br>
As last resort, there is a little nook of Hell — <br>
The house, that’s now become a mighty citadel.<br>
They've walled the windows, barricaded up the door,<br>
The attic has been made an ammunition store,<br>
And when the Pious party moves to the attack,<br>
From overhead the Free can give their skulls a crack.<br>
Now, drawing nearer with a wild, exultant sound,<br>
The Free disperse to man the bastions all around.<br>
       On, on from <i>Halle</i> march God’s soldiers, one and all,<br>
With <i>Jacob’s</i> scaling ladder for the fortress wall.<br>
Flag-like, the fiery pillar proudly goes before them,<br>
And burning bushes light the darkling roadway for them.<br>
Could I but paint the pious train in colours bright,<br>
And richly bathe it round in beams of holy light!<br>
Proud, wrathful <i>Leo</i> is the one who takes the lead.<br>
Swinging along without constraint, he strides ahead,<br>
Five volumes of world history in his pious fists,<br>
He’s otherwise unarmed, it is in Faith he trusts<br>
Where arrogance and self-assurance aren’t enough.<br>
The next line’s leader is indeed of Godly stuff — <br>
Nerr <i>Julius Sinck von Sinus</i>  as the Pious know him.<br>
The dear man thinks to carry arms would be below him.<br>
With presence pure and simple does he smite the Free,<br>
And so the Faithful gather round him trustingly.<br>
And sacred songs and prayer are their only arms,<br>
Because when from afar the strains of heavenly psalms<br>
Resound, the Free forthwith take to their heels and run.<br>
<i>Bonn</i> sends a host of stalwarts, champions, every one;<br>
They're led by Brother Nix. [Karl Immanuel Nitzsch] The Swabians now draw nigh;<br>
The <i>Christian Courier</i> [<i>Der Christen-Bote. Ein kirchlich-religiöses Sonntagsblatt</i>]is the banner that they fly.<br>
Brave <i>Mallet</i> brings the faithful folk of <i>Bremen</i> in,<br>
And <i>Hengstenberg</i> commands the Pious from <i>Berlin</i>.<br>
And even you, the ones who ordered <i>Strauss</i> away<br>
From Zurich, follow fearless <i>Hirzel</i> to the fray,<br>
The priest of Pfäffikon. [Bernhard Hirzel] They come from <i>Basel</i>, too.<br>
<i>Krummacher</i>, man of God, from <i>Wuppertal</i> are you.<br>
The troops form up. in every spacious Leipzig square,<br>
And sounds of exultation fill the distant air,<br>
Strains of upswelling song to touch the heart’s own strings.<br>
Each asks his neighbour: Say, who can it he that sings?<br>
Behold, astride his she-ass (all stand goggle-eyed)<br>
Comes <i>Brother Bag</i>; he sees the Heavens open wide.<br>
And this is what he sings: “God’s sword and Gideon here!<br>
Up, Brothers, and behold the Devil’s earthworks there!<br>
However terribly they yawn, those gates of Hell,<br>
Onward and trust in Godt Faith will acquit you well!”<br>
       Behold the she-ass up the bastions nimbly springing,<br>
And, following after her, the Faithful ones all singing!<br>
Oh, what a fierce attack! Despair, all ye Blasphemers!<br>
Scream for your devil now, ye God-forsaken screamers!<br>
Now <i>Brother Bag </i>flies up that mighty wall of Pride<br>
That Hengstenberg may lead his pious troops inside.<br>
But there within, the Devil orders the. defence,<br>
Banishes craven doubts and counsels with good sense.<br>
See, <i>Blücher-Wigand</i> stands high on the ravelin,<br>
Egged on by <i>Maien</i>. How they make their missiles spin!<br>
There’s <i>Stirner</i>, see him flinging bales of books entire,<br>
While hordes of Pious warriors melt beneath his fire.<br>
See <i>Arnold</i> on the wall: he hardly ever misses,<br>
Hurling his Yearbooks down at all those pious faces.<br>
High on the wall of books and in the leading row,<br>
Mad Bauer wields The Trumpet, blow on deadly blow,<br>
The Patriot [Ludwig Buhl] ensconced where no missile can fly,<br>
Tosses his pamphlets backwards at the enemy,<br>
While with his toad-spit furious <i>Köppen</i> stems the flood,<br>
But most humanely takes good care to shed no blood.<br>
The raving <i>Edgar</i> fights with brewer strength and valour,<br>
While red with blood is <i>Oswald’s</i> coat of pepper colour.<br>
See the Cologne contingent. In the furious fray<br>
<i>Rtg’s</i> pipe’s gone out; but he feels no dismay:<br>
Swinging it by its long and supple tube right well, he<br>
Wraps the water-bowl round many a pious belly.<br>
Gold devils are the missiles that the <i>Youngster</i> [Georg Jung] skims;<br>
The <i>Monster</i> [Karl Marx] joins the battle flexing all his limbs.<br>
Yet on the Pious press, still more victorious;<br>
Their Hallelujahs ringing still more glorious.<br>
Up on the mound of books has <i>Hengstenberg</i> appeared.<br>
He seizes <i>Blücher-Wigand</i> by his long blond beard.<br>
Raging, he pulls it out and manages to chuck<br>
<i>Wigand</i> full length into a horrid pool of muck.<br>
<i>Edgar</i> is now hard pressed, and Arnold is beset.<br>
<i>Köppen</i> has fled indoors; with him, the <i>Patriot</i>.<br>
The arrogant wall of books is almost half torn down,<br>
But still the frenzied Bauer stands his ground alone.<br>
He hurls a bale of books at Bag to seal the doom<br>
Of that most pious one and be a fitting tomb.<br>
Herr <i>Sinck von Sinnes</i> staggers at a blow of his.<br>
But <i>Halle’s</i> <i>Leo </i>still defies Hell’s wild abyss.<br>
A Samson, he strains hard at that proud fortress wall.<br>
It crashes down. See <i>Bauer</i>, even <i>Bauer</i>, fall!<br>
Pinned helpless to the ground by his own bales he lies.<br>
See the Believers set on him with joyous cries!<br>
Bag struggles to his feet. With a triumphant cheer<br>
He goes across to <i>Bauer</i>, grips him by the ear,<br>
And says: “Ye Faithful, God fulfilleth all my hopes<br>
The Lord my refuge is. I see the Heavens ope!<br>
Leave <i>Bauer</i> in my hands. To battle, never fear!<br>
While you defeat the others, I shall guard him here!”<br>
They truss up <i>Bauer</i>, then, to hymns victorious,<br>
They set their Jacob’s ladder up against the house.<br>
Now rocks the Gutenberg, now splits the fortress door,<br>
Near empty is the attic ammunition store.<br>
Now wrings the <i>Patriot</i> his hands in grief and woe,<br>
Now <i>Arnold’s</i> ham is wounded by a flying blow.<br>
<i>Maien</i> is bleeding from the mouth and nose as well.<br>
Frightened, the Devil plunges down the abyss of Hell.<br>
       He plummets down into the depths with shrieks of horror. <br>
Ha, how the wicked ones all huddle up in terror! <br>
They plead, blaspheme, and threaten. Then, all trembling, he: <br>
“Oh, shame, the Pious have made mincemeat of the Free! <br>
Useless my jeers, my fetor pestilential.<br>
Alas, they've beaten me with songs celestial<br>
<i>Bauer</i> is captive, <i>Wigand’s</i> lost his beard withal,<br>
And now they've stormed and occupied our book-bale wall!”<br>
The depths of Hell resound with dreadful shrieks of fear;<br>
Wild <i>Hegel’s</i> agony is horrible to hear.<br>
No sooner has the gang recovered from this news,<br>
Than Hell’s mad Knights break into bluster and abuse<br>
In mutinous uproar. “You claim to be the Devil,<br>
And let things come to this!” screams forth the frenzied <i>Hegel.</i><br>
“Where were your sulphur fumes, your blazing firebrands bright?<br>
Scared monster, did a mere Amen put you to flight?<br>
Too late we see you're much too old to keep the pace;<br>
Women and children are the only ones you chase.<br>
UP, for swift action helps, not weeping and despair.<br>
Up, <i>Danton</i>, up, <i>Voltaire</i>, and you too, <i>Robespierre</i>!<br>
Earth-creatures, you alone can end this infamy.<br>
To Heaven with the Devil! We shall devils be!<br>
The mythic scum was never any use at all.<br>
A thousand years of flame won’t fire the craven soul. <br>
Brother <i>Marat</i>, arise! At last we've learned our need. <br>
We, who were human once, must choose a man to lead. <br>
The Devil was, and still remains, nought but a myth, <br>
He is our foe like any true son of the Faith.<br>
To victory, then!”<br>
       With crazed impetuosity<br>
Straight out of Hell the blood-voracious Aesir flee.<br>
Their leader, <i>Hegel</i>, swings two torches in the air,<br>
Whirling a fiery flail, behind him comes <i>Voltaire</i>.<br>
<i>Danton</i> is shouting with them, <i>Edelmann</i> is howling.<br>
“Charge, charge, you scum of Hell!” <i>Napoleon</i> is bawling.<br>
<i>Marat</i> holds in his hands two of Hell’s hairy litter;<br>
Depraved man-murderer, he’s thirsting for the slaughter.<br>
Whirling along with twisted mouth flies <i>Robespierre</i>.<br>
See the crazed mob disgorged by Hell’s abyss down there!<br>
No sooner are they out, than all that desperate shower<br>
Head for where <i>Brother Bag</i> is standing guard on <i>Bauer</i>.<br>
Bag is much shaken. Tears stream from the donkey’s eyes.<br>
“O Lord, the end is near! Our time is come!” she cries.<br>
<i>Marat</i> lets fly a shot, and <i>Bag</i>, all glassy-eyed,<br>
Sinks to the ground. He sees the Heavens open wide.<br>
<i>Hegel</i> embraces <i>crazy Bauer</i>. “Yes, ‘tis done!<br>
You've comprehended mel You are my own dear son!”<br>
He frees him. Then the wicked ones with great delight:<br>
“<i>Bauer’s</i> our herol He shall lead us to the fight!<br>
The Devil is deposed. What we need is a man!”<br>
And then with screams and yells they charge the pious band.<br>
The tables are now turned. God’s folk flee, sorely tried.<br>
But Bag, as usual, sees the Heavens open wide.<br>
He’s borne aloft to Heaven by his virgin ass.<br>
Oh, what a miracle the Lord bath brought to pass!<br>
Behold <i>Elijah-Bag</i> aloft to Heaven sailing,<br>
The plans of the Blasphemers gloriously foiling.<br>
Behind, the shining armies of the pious rise,<br>
With songs of joy ascending to the very skies.<br>
But, with triumphant shouts, Hell’s evil offspring shoot<br>
Straight up behind the Almighty’s host in hot pursuit.<br>
Now fear and horror overwhelm the pious troops,<br>
As Hell’s pack surges up with savage yells and whoops.<br>
       Meanwhile, the Devil has for, some time been struck dumb<br>
By the rebellion which has, carried every one<br>
Of his best men away. Hell’s taken by surprise.<br>
All stand unmoving and regard with staring eyes<br>
The exit through which Hegel’s host has just dispersed.<br>
Till from his foaming mouth the imprecations burst:<br>
“Fool that I am — betrayed! I now see where it leads!<br>
Their deed’s more devilish than all my wretched deeds.<br>
I led the Free astray, till they became too free,<br>
And now they've gone and foully freed themselves from me!<br>
Truly, it is past help, the lowly human breed,<br>
Craving the most outrageous freedom in its greed.<br>
If all these Free hold nothing sacred any more,<br>
Is it my ruin, too, they're really aiming for?<br>
Denying God, I only fight against myself.<br>
Soon, as a myth, I too shall end up on the shelf.<br>
To Heav'n! We'll seek the Lord up there with due compliance;<br>
United, we shall form a holy High Alliance!”<br>
He soars aloft. And, kneeling at God’s feet, begins:<br>
“Lord, do not make me pay for all my wretched sins!<br>
I join you in the fight!” God, generous, replies:<br>
“For just this once we'll let your old trespasses be.<br>
Go, wash your wicked sins off in Blasphemers’ blood,<br>
Return, and leave the rest to me, your gracious God!”<br>
       Joyous, he rushes off. The battle’s almost lost,<br>
For though assistance has gone to the pious host,<br>
Oh, ignominy! — with the Faith it’s nearly over.<br>
The wicked follow up one triumph with another.<br>
From star to star, insane with fury, Bauer springs,<br>
And in his hand <i>The Trumpet</i> for a club he swings.<br>
At him come charging all the four Evangelists,<br>
But nothing daunts the boldest of the Atheists.<br>
Though <i>Luke’s</i> Bull levels angry horns and charges at him,<br>
Though <i>Mark’s</i> great lion roars, there’s nothing can affright him.<br>
He puts them all to flight. Wild <i>Hegel </i>in his ire<br>
Scorches the angel pinions with a brand of fire.<br>
Foul <i>Voitaire’s</i> flail still blazes brightly like a torch,<br>
While raving <i>Ruge</i> thumps the Elders of the Church.<br>
Now see how <i>Bauer</i> plucks a star from off its course<br>
And sends it shooting at the fleeing pious force.<br>
‘ne Devil’s pole-axed by a <i>Trumpet</i> blow at last;<br>
Michael himself cannot withstand its mighty blast.<br>
Next, furious <i>Hegel</i> seizes Sirius and throws<br>
It straight at <i>Hengstenberg</i>: white as a sheet he goes.<br>
See how the angel host, with wings a-smouldering, flies<br>
Up through the misty clouds with frightened, piteous cries.<br>
The Lambkin braves the Monster with a Cross held high;<br>
The latter balls his fist and shakes it threateningly.<br>
Even the Virgin Mary leaves her holy place,<br>
To deeds of derring-do she spurs the angelic race.<br>
“Up, against <i>Bauer</i>, up against the Titan, go!<br>
He tried to apprehend me, I would have you know!”<br>
However much she pleads, however sweet her glances,<br>
The army of the Free ones steadily advances.<br>
And now towards the Almighty’s holy realm they storm,<br>
God’s hosts are impotent against the oncoming swarm.<br>
Into a star the pious ass bumps with her rider;<br>
Head over heels she goes, with Brother Bag astride her.<br>
<i>Bauer</i> at once swoops on him with a horrid shout,<br>
The fatal <i>Trumpet</i> ready aimed to snuff him out.<br>
Ruge grabs Leo of the Saale: with some force<br>
He stuffs a page of Annals in between his jaws. — <br>
But what’s this floating down bathed in celestial light?<br>
What’s making <i>Bauer</i> shake from head to foot with fright?<br>
It’s just a little piece of parchment, strange to say.<br>
What might be written on it by the heavenly ray?<br>
It flutters down. At <i>Bauer’s</i> feet it comes to rest.<br>
Shaking, he stoops and picks it up with heaving breast. — <br>
Why does the cold sweat on his brow spring so abundant?<br>
What does he murmur, stunned? He murmurs this — “Redundant!”<br>
Hardly has Heaven’s word from Hell’s own mouth rung out, <br>
Before “Redundant!” is the universal shout.<br>
The Free are horror-struck, the Angels filled with glee, <br>
The Free take flight, the Host pursues relentlessly. <br>
The Free are driven down to Earth in full confusion, <br>
That wicked folk shall all receive due retribution.<br>

<p class="title">The Insolently Threatened Yet Miraculously Rescued Bible</p>
<h1>Canto The Third</h1>
<p class="verse">
What do I see? A frenzied host so glittering bright<br>
With Blasphemy, the very sun has lost its light?<br>
Who are they? See them, how they all come surging forth,<br>
Foregathering from East, and South, and West, and North.<br>
The scum of Germany, they meet in convocation<br>
To whip their spirits up for still more evil action.<br>
Already they have felt the Lord’s hand moving o'er them,<br>
       Already they have guessed how Satan’s clutch could claw them<br>
Down to a dreadful doom. Knowing despair full well,<br>
They've felt like letting Atheism go to Hell.<br>
Then <i>Arnold</i> [Ruge] summons all those of the Free persuasion<br>
To meet at <i>Bockenheim</i> in Hellish congregation.<br>
“Arise, you Free ones all! How can you sit so tight,<br>
When the Romantics plunge the whole world into night?<br>
Or when Reaction stirs and, cunning as of old,<br>
Almost has Science in its deadly stranglehold?<br>
Bauer’s in peril. Of your thoughts and writings, most<br>
Go straight up to the raving Censor and are lost.<br>
Free brethren, hear my Manifesto, all of you,<br>
Of course, provided that the Censor lets it through:<br>
High time that we as diplomats discussed with weight<br>
The Holy Alliance in congressional debate!<br>
Do you see how the high Police determinedly<br>
Abolish everywhere one little word — that’s <i>free</i>?<br>
And now the Lamb of God joins the <i>Gensdarmerie</i>,<br>
And is about to sink to bestiality.<br>
So onwards, then, Free ones; to <i>Bockenheim</i> we'll go;<br>
Seeds of fresh action there united we shall sow!”<br>
       Scarce was this Manifesto broadcast far and wide,<br>
When awful urges, evil cravings surge inside<br>
Each brazen breast to leave forthwith for <i>Bockenheim</i>.<br>
<i>Berlin</i> it is that sends the most devoid of shame.<br>
Broad <i>Arnold</i> heads them as they brashly march along;<br>
Behind him mills a lunatic and loathsome throng.<br>
And all that yelling gang, that Atheistic mob,<br>
Is much more wild than ever was the jacobin Club.<br>
That’s <i>Köppen</i> you can see there with his glasses on.<br>
if Ruge but allowed, he'd be a virtuous man.<br>
But <i>Arnold’s</i> raving fury has him so impressed:<br>
He has a sword and wears it dangling from his waist;<br>
It’s like a demon’s tail, a long and rusty thing,<br>
And when he dances, see how bravely it can swing.<br>
He’s wearing epaulettes and brandishing about<br>
A stick with which to beat the thirst for knowledge out<br>
Of flaming youth. Next, [Eduard] <i>Maien</i> comes along, the Free;<br>
Familiar everywhere to everyone is he:<br>
An Atheist born, the vilest love him well: Voltaire<br>
Ever since birth has been his daily reading fare.<br>
So nice, so soft, so small — <i>Maien</i>, you devil, you!<br>
Those ruffians with you making all that hullabaloo,<br>
They're not your nephews? Have you lured them in as well?<br>
You'd take your family with you on your trip to Hell?<br>
Right on the very left, that tall and long-legged stepper<br>
Is<i> Oswald,</i> [Engels] coat of grey and trousers shade of pepper;<br>
Pepper inside as well, <i>Oswald</i> the Montagnard;<br>
A radical is he, dyed in the wool, and hard.<br>
Day in, day out, he plays upon the guillotine a<br>
Single solitary tune and that’s a cavatina,<br>
The same old devil-song; he bellows the refrain:<br>
<i>Formez vos bataillons! Aux arines, citoyens!</i><br>
[Form your battalions! To arms, citizens! — from the <i>Marseillaise</i>]<br>
Who raves beside him, with the muscles of a brewer?<br>
It’s old Bloodlust himself in person, <i>Edgar Bauer</i>.<br>
His brown-complexioned face through bushy whiskers peers;<br>
And he’s as old in cunning as he’s young in years.<br>
Outside, a smart blue coat; inside he’s black, lacks polish;<br>
Outside he’s dandified; inside he’s sansculottish ‘<br>
His shadow’s with him, it’s a wonder to behold it;<br>
His evil shadow’s there, and <i>Radge</i> [Edgar Bauer]  he has called it.<br>
See <i>Stirner</i> too, the thoughtful moderation-hater;<br>
Though still on beer, he'll soon be drinking blood like water.<br>
And if the others shout a wild: <i>à bas les rois!'</i>[Down with Kings]<br>
<i>Stirner</i> is sure to add: <i>à bas aussi les lois</i> [Down with the laws as well!]<br>
Next, baring greenish teeth, comes tripping on his way,<br>
His hair unkempt and tousled, prematurely grey,<br>
A soap-and-water-shy and blood-shy <i>Patriot</i> [Ludwig Buhl],<br>
So smooth and soft inside; outside a sansculotte.<br>
Wild <i>Arnold</i> heads them, Czar of All the Atheists,<br>
And high upon his baton’s end he twirls and twists<br>
Copies of <i>Halle Annals</i>. Next, there follow on<br>
The crew that Satan’s picked to gorge himself upon.<br>
       As soon as they arrive, in bursts the frantic <i>Bauer</i>, <br>
Engulfed in smoke and steam and Hell-rain’s deadly shower.<br>
He raves, a lanky villain in a coat of green;<br>
Behind the leering face Hell’s offspring can be seen.<br>
He hoists his flag aloft, and in an arc up high<br>
The sparks of his rude Bible criticisms fly.<br>
Who runs up next with wild impetuosity?<br>
A swarthy chap of <i>Trier</i> [Marx], a marked monstrosity.<br>
He neither hops nor skips, but moves in leaps and bounds,<br>
Raving aloud. As if to seize and then pull down<br>
To Earth the spacious tent of Heaven up on high,<br>
He opens wide his arms and reaches for the sky.<br>
He shakes his wicked fist, raves with a frantic air,<br>
As if ten thousand devils had him by the. hair.<br>
Next, from <i>Cologne</i>, a <i>Youngster</i> [Georg Jung] something of a swell,<br>
Too bad for Heaven, too good to pass the gates of Hell.<br>
He’s half a sansculotte, and half an aristo,<br>
A suave rich gentleman with pleats in his jabot.<br>
The pleats inside his soul add up to even more.<br>
His pocket lining’s filled with demons by the score<br>
With golden faces. Next, one who indeed disgusts, <br>
The dawdling <i>Rtg</i>, [adolf Ruenberg] quite handy with his fists.<br>
He has an evil habit: constantly he smokes<br>
Hellish tobacco in an ell-long pipe which pokes<br>
Out of his mouth, and which he never once removes <br>
Except to give his utterance point when he reproves. <br>
But who comes from the South as lonely as a cloud, <br>
Disdaining sympathy, himself a one-man crowd, <br>
A one-man host of Atheists fanatical,<br>
A one-man treasure store of craft Satanical,<br>
A one-man fount of wicked blasphemy and shame?<br>
Help us, Saint John, it’s <i>Feuerbach</i> of dreadful name!<br>
He neither raves nor bounds, but hovers in mid-air,<br>
An awful meteor girt by hellish vapours there.<br>
In the one hand he holds outstretched the cup that shines,<br>
And in the other one, the bread loaf that sustains.<br>
He sits up to his navel in a sea-shell basin,<br>
Trying to find a new church service for the brazen.<br>
Guzzling, boozing, bathing, firmly he maintains,<br>
Are all the truth the holy sacrament contains.<br>
A storm of shouts and cheers succeeds the first hurrah!<br>
And then he must be taken to a public bar.<br>
At once, all hell breaks loose; the uproar is so loud<br>
‘Rat nobody can gain the attention of the crowd.<br>
       They won’t sit still; they heave, and push, and shove around.<br>
The Evil Spirit keeps them whirling round and round.<br>
Their loathing of inaction gives them all no peace;<br>
And futile calls for quiet continue without cease.<br>
Then <i>Köppen</i>, that most virtuous, order-loving chap,<br>
Flies off into a rage. “Is this the savage steppe?<br>
Have you forgotten in this wild barbaric throng<br>
What was the purpose of our journey all along?<br>
O <i>Arnold</i>, trusty bastion, speak, start the discussion.<br>
Will you not show us how to find the best solution?”<br>
Oswald and Edgar shout in roaring unison:<br>
“Now that’s enough of these disgraceful goings-on!”<br>
Then silence fell. And <i>Arnold</i>, who, quite guiltlessly,<br>
Had in the meantime been consuming beefsteaks three,<br>
On the last mouthful seemed as if about to choke,<br>
But managed in the end to get it down, and spoke:<br>
       “Oh, what a lovely vision’s there in Unity: Free brethren, ever<br>
       Ready for battle and for death, obedient should the Idea command.<br>
       Reaction holds us by the hair, it lifts the stick with threatening hand,<br>
       But it can never tame us, Friends, if we stand firm asone together.”<br>
<i>Oswald </i>and <i>Edgar</i> cannot wait until he’s done.<br>
They both jump on the table, then they shriek as one: <br>
       "Ruge, we've had enough of all this talk from you!<br>
       What we want now is deeds, not words. We want some action!” <br>
A frenzied <i>bravo</i>! is the ill-advised reaction;<br>
Everyone keeps demanding: “Action, action, action!” <br>
Then with a mocking laugh shouts <i>Arnold</i> in reply:<br>
       "Our actions are just words, and long they so shall be. <br>
       After Abstraction, Practice follows of itself.” <br>
Meanwhile, athirst for deeds, the wildly screaming pair <br>
Have lifted crazy Bruno high on to a chair.<br>
A crowd swarms round him and he’s hoisted really high. <br>
Aloft, he hovers like an eagle in the sky.<br>
With frenzied burning passion are his eyes aglow,<br>
And lowering black with fury is his furrowed brow.<br>
Oh, how he screams and raves. But opposite, alack,<br>
The swart monstrosity has climbed Rtg’s back.<br>
Hear how he raves and screams. just hear how both are raving:<br>
“How long d'you think that words will satisfy our craving?”<br>
<i>Bauer</i>. See you, O blind one, <br>
       See you the Pious,<br>
       How they draw nigh us?<br>
<i>Monster</i>. Their pious corps<br>
       Grows more and more.<br>
<i>Bauer</i>: Bag’s at his tricks, <br>
       Hoodwinking the public.<br>
<i>Monster</i>. A pity the Lord hasn’t noticed how dire <br>
       The need of the world for another Messiah.<br>
<i>Bauer</i>. It’s not one Lamb we've got to impede us; <br>
       We're faced with an actual flock of the creatures.<br>
<i>Monster</i>: The Holy Ghost, we know,<br>
       Moves in a thousand forms below.<br>
<i>Both:</i> We're not just plagued with the Trinity; <br>
       The Police and the Faith have joined up in a Twinity.<br>
<i>Monster</i>: When they are vigilant,. <br>
       Should we be negligent?<br>
<i>Bauer</i>: When they are arming, <br>
       Should we be yawning?<br>
Voices are heard all round: “We're game for battle now!”<br>
But <i>Ludwig Feuerbach</i> sparks off another row.<br>
He roars: “Why should we waste our time with all this talk?<br>
Who action seeks, let him get on and do the work.<br>
The Free man helps himself, ay, he and he alone.<br>
Whatever he achieves, he does all on his own!”<br>
His glasses gleaming, Köppen jumps up with a bound,<br>
His Jovian head commanding silence all around.<br>
“Against united action, then, you take your stand?<br>
But it alone stops matters getting out of hand;<br>
The stream of Progress flows untroubled, undiverted,<br>
And, best of all, the risk of bloodshed is averted!”<br>
<i>Edgar</i> and <i>Oswald</i> shriek: “Confounded Girondist!<br>
Out, feeble-minded dreamer; you're no Atheist!”<br>
Then <i>Stirner</i>, dignified: “Who binds his will around?<br>
Who would impose a law by shouting people down?<br>
You tie his will and have the nerve to say you're free;<br>
A lot you've done to break away from slavery!<br>
Down with all rules and laws, say I!” This aberration<br>
Has the whole Hellish congress in complete confusion.<br>
The ceiling splits, and <i>Blücher-Wigand’s</i> seen aloft<br>
Swooping into the hall on his own flying raft.<br>
A paper dragon — Oh, Satanic arts! — he flies.<br>
“What are you up to now?” he vigorously cries.<br>
“See how I soar<br>
On editions galore<br>
Of the German <i>Yearbook</i> <br>
I gummed them myself,<br>
I bound them myself,<br>
I, Blücher, just look!<br>
If they can bear me through the air,<br>
Need you despair?<br>
       Woe, I cry,<br>
With Frankfurt nigh,<br>
Isn’t everything all right?<br>
There is Peace and Union still,<br>
And the Great All-Highest Will<br>
For the high and for the highest,<br>
For the low and for the lowest,<br>
Is Conviction, Lodestar, Light.<br>
       Woe, I cry,<br>
From Frankfurt nigh<br>
Has an evil wind come blowing?<br>
Shall the Free ones not withstand<br>
The Union’s <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume02/footnote.html#165" target=_blank>[165]</a></sup> wind throughout the land?<br>
Follow me and let’s be going!<br>
To <i>Leipzig</i>! There I've mounted lovely batteries<br>
That all the Pious hosts together could not seize.<br>
The house in which I Hegelised of old<br>
Has latterly been turned into A Safe Stronghold.<br>
The <i>Gutenberg</i> and <i>Leipzig</i> be our rendezvous.<br>
The book-trade’s centre shall be the State centre too.”<br>
       “Yes, yes, to Leipzig!” cries on every side resound.<br>
“Let that the centre be, our forces’ rallying ground!”<br>
They all depart, with <i>Wigand</i> flying in the lead,<br>
But <i>Feuerbach</i> pursues a lonely course indeed.<br>
       But leave that show. I'm beckoned by a peaceful valley.<br>
The Lord’s own City calls me — Halle on the Saale.<br>
O Town of bliss, still faithful to the Lord you are!<br>
To beat the Devil’s craft e'er brighter gleams your star.<br>
<i>Ruge</i> poured out his pus on you to no avail;<br>
Thanks to your loyalty, his schemes were doomed to fail.<br>
He went off in a rage, nor has he since come back.<br>
Town, thank the Lord who gave you triumph and good luck.<br>
See all the Faithful, see the Chosen gathered round<br>
To sing His praises with a sweet and pleasant sound.<br>
Oh, what a fine assemblage! See that cobbler there<br>
Whose feverish, skinny body spurs him into prayer.<br>
The barman of the Temperance League is present too:<br>
Pay him — he'll pour pure drinking water out for you.<br>
God’s peace shines in the moon-like face behind the bar.<br>
Truly, with firm-held faith a person can go far!<br>
That little woman there is bowed with sinfulness,<br>
And yet her stiff old limbs are bathed in blessedness.<br>
All in a soulful shriek she sings a holy lay,<br>
And mortifies her shrunken body night and day.<br>
Next, there is <i>Leo</i>, Lion of the Saale strand.<br>
His strength of faith indeed delights the angel band.<br>
In faith he hurled himself the <i>Hegelings</i> <sup class="enote"><a href="../../cw/volume02/footnote.html#166" target=_blank>[l66]</a></sup> upon,<br>
In faith defended he the Altar and the Throne,<br>
In faith did he improve, up-end, and set aright<br>
Godless world history by Heaven’s shining light.<br>
Go to the little room, O Faithful, enter in,<br>
And sing unto your God a gentle, gracious hymn.<br>
Oh, hear the little ditty sounding forth, to rise<br>
Towards the Throne of Grace like fumes of sacrifice:<br>
              "Lord, we are carrion of the beast, <br>
       A poxy stench, a raven’s feast,<br>
       A knacker’s pit of sin.<br>
       From the womb we're bad outright.<br>
       Crush us; it would serve us right<br>
       For all our wicked sin.<br>
       If Thou didst, then Thou hadst blessed us,<br>
       Thus to wrest us<br>
       From the cancers that infest us.<br>
              Thou lettest us ascend to Thee<br>
       Unto Thine Angels, fair to see,<br>
       And washest us of sin.<br>
       The Evil One Thou’st driven out<br>
       Who filled our hearts with fear and doubt.<br>
       Destroy and banish him.<br>
       Sizzling, frizzling in the horror<br>
       Of Hell-terror<br>
       Leave him spitted<br>
       For the wicked sins committed!”<br>
And now the cobbler stands upon a chair to tell<br>
In fearsome tones about the sulphur lake of Hell.<br>
“Behold the dreadful gorge that spills its contents out,<br>
Fire, pitch and sulphur over all the lands about.'<br>
See how it stews and brews, spews demons up of fire<br>
To gobble up the world of Christendom entire.<br>
Black seeds of Hell it scatters ‘mid the race of men.<br>
Great is the Lord thy God. The world is doomed. Amen.”<br>
“That’s true enough!” shouts <i>Leo</i>. “Those demons are so rude,<br>
They cover not their private parts and all go nude!<br>
The Great Whore comes from Babylon with its pollution,<br>
And that Great Whore is Reason’s Goddess, Revolution!<br>
<i>Bauer</i> is <i>Robespierre, Ruge’s Danton</i>; and worse,<br>
<i>Feuerbach </i>is <i>Marat</i>. O God, send down Thy curse!<br>
Ye Faithful, watch the times, for cometh soon the Day,<br>
The Day of God the Father. Therefore, watch and pray!”<br>
       He speaks. But all stand thunderstruck and goggle-eyed — <br>
It’s <i>Brother Bag</i>: he sees the Heavens open wide.<br>
His mount’s the she-ass, mouthpiece of the Almighty’s Word;<br>
She'll take him on his last ascent to meet his Lord.<br>
With trust in God and strength to Heav'n he turns his eyes,<br>
And says: “O Pious band, your works I recognise.<br>
Thus saith the Lord: my servant ye shall all obey<br>
That I have picked to lead my host into the fray.<br>
Obey our <i>Brother Bag</i>, obey him as you ought,<br>
And Satan’s craft and power he shall surely thwart.<br>
Thus spake the Lord. I fell upon my knees and said:<br>
But call me, Lord, I'll follow Thee where'er I'm led.<br>
Then left I cheerly and the Lord’s Word did begin<br>
To spread, the Lord’s good year, to all this world of sin.<br>
Then in through many a wealthy castle gate I went<br>
To visit prince, and queen, all folk of great descent.<br>
But they, who ever thirst for worldly goods, and choose<br>
To covet honours vain, received me with abuse.<br>
They sat around the board in rich debauchery;<br>
And cheek by jowl were lust of flesh and lust of eye.<br>
I shook the dust from off my feet. The Lord then spake,<br>
Stirring me in the depths of sleep till I should wake.<br>
‘Shall the rich man see Heav'n, however much he try,<br>
Or shall the camel pass right through a needle’s eye?<br>
What bath been written? On the highways thou shalt find<br>
The homeless wandering poor, the halt, the lame, the blind.<br>
Bring all the maimed ones from the alleys home to sup;<br>
Call those by fences, let your voice be lifted up.<br>
They are the faithful ones, they are my army’s core.<br>
Collect, recruit them, multiply them more and more.'<br>
Thus spake the Lord. And 1, I come without delay<br>
To you, the Faithful, for to do as He did say.<br>
Obey the Lord your God. Soon will come morning’s light,<br>
When with the Devil we must fight the mighty fight.<br>
The Free ones mobilise; <i>Leipzig’s</i> their destination,<br>
And <i>Blücher-Wigand’s</i> house is their fortification.<br>
They've piled up books and bales of paper by the score,<br>
It’s there they mean to dance the holy dance of war.<br>
Stout hearts and steadfastness shall aid us in that hour,<br>
When we go forth to storm the foul Blasphemers’ tower.<br>
Assemble, brethren. Be ye strong in love and hope.<br>
Hold fast to Faith. I see up there the Heavens ope.<br>
Faith is indeed the Alpha and the Omega,<br>
In faith, thou'rt truly great, <i>Halle</i>, Hallelujah!<br>
In faith the Maid conceived the Son that God begat,<br>
In faith was jonah from the alarmed whale’s belly spat.<br>
In faith the Lord did promulgate the Gospel’s word,<br>
In faith the Lord’s voice in a donkey’s mouth I heard.<br>
In faith the blind one saw the light against all hope,<br>
In faith do I look up and see the Heavens ope.<br>
In faith do I cry out: <i>credo ut intelligam</i>,<br>
In faith I cling unto the holy Cross’s stem.<br>
In faith are all my deeds, in faith is all my hope,<br>
In faith do I look up and see the Heavens ope.<br>
Thus saith the Lord: now let my servant Leo be<br>
Ale doughty Captain of the Halle company.<br>
Go, visit every town and city in the land,<br>
Find soldiers and field surgeons there on every hand.<br>
By night or day allow yourself no respite, ever,<br>
Until the Faithful army has been brought together.<br>
Thus saith the Lord thy God, my refuge and my hope!<br>
Farewell, dear brethren, for I see the Heavens ope!” — <br>

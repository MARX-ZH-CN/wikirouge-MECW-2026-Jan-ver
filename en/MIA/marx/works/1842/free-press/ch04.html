[As a privilege of particular individuals<br> or a privilege of the human mind?]
</h3>
<!--
The debate turns
        precisely on
whether it is in the nature of the press to have a free or unfree
        existence.
-->
<hr class="end"/>
<p>From the standpoint of the idea, it is
self-evident that freedom of the press has a justification quite different
from that of censorship because it is itself an embodiment of the idea,
an embodiment of freedom, a positive good, whereas censorship is an embodiment
of unfreedom, the polemic of a world outlook of semblance against the world
outlook of essence; it has a merely negative nature.
</p>
<p>No! No! No! our speaker breaks in. I do not find fault with the
semblance, but with the essence. Freedom is the wicked feature of freedom
of the press. Freedom creates the possibility of evil. Therefore freedom
is evil.
</p>
<p>Evil freedom!

<p class="quote">"This time I must talk to you,
<br>Lord and master, hear me calmly!"
<a href="#2" id="a2"><sup class="ednote">[B]</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
<i>But does not freedom of the press exist in the land of censorship?</i>
The press in general is a realisation of human freedom. Consequently, where
is a press there is freedom of the press.
</p>
<p>True, in the land of censorship the state has no freedom of the
press, but one organ of the state has it, viz., the <i>government</i>.
Apart from the fact that official government documents enjoy perfect freedom
of the press, does not the censor exercise daily an unconditional freedom
of the press, if not directly, then indirectly?
</p>
<p>Writers are, as it were, his secretaries. When the secretary does
not express the opinion of his chief, the latter strikes out the botch.
Hence the censorship makes the press.
</p>
<p>The censor's deletions are for the press what the straight lines
— kus — of the Chinese are for their thought. The censor's kus are the
categories of literature, and it is well known that the categories are
the typical souls of the whole content.
</p>
<p>Freedom is so much the <a href="../../../../../glossary/terms/e/s.html#essence" target=_blank>essence</a> of man that even its opponents
implement it while combating its reality; they want to appropriate for,
themselves as a most precious ornament what they have rejected as an ornament
of human nature.
</p>
<p>No man combats freedom; at most he combats the freedom of others.
Hence every kind of freedom has always existed, only at one time as a special
privilege, at another as a universal right.
</p>
<p>The question has now for the first time been given a <i>consistent
meaning</i>. It is not a question whether freedom of the press ought to
exist, for it always exists. The question is whether freedom of the press
is a privilege of particular individuals or whether it is a privilege of
the human mind. The question is whether a right of one side ought to be
a wrong for the other side. The question is whether "<i>freedom of the
mind</i>" has more right than "<i>freedom against the mind</i>".
</p>
<p>If, however, the <i>"free press"</i> and <i>"freedom of the press</i>"
as the realisation of "<i>universal freedom</i>" are to be rejected, then
this applies still more to <i>censorship</i> and the <i>censored press</i>
as the realisation of a <i>special freedom,</i> for how can the <i>species
</i>be good if the <i>genus</i> is bad? If the speaker were consistent
he would have to reject not the free press, but the press as a whole. According
to him, the press would only be good if it were not a product of freedom,
i.e., not a <i>human</i> product. Hence in general only <i>animals</i>
or <i>gods</i> would have the right to a press.
</p>
<p>Or ought we perhaps — the speaker dare not say it outright —
to suppose <i>divine inspiration</i> of the government and of the speaker
himself?
</p>
<p>If a private person boasts of divine inspiration, there is only
one speaker in our society who can refute him officially, viz., the <i>psychiatrist.</i>
</p>
<p><i>English history,</i> however, has sufficiently well demonstrated
how the assertion of divine inspiration from above gives rise to the counter-assertion
of divine inspiration from below; Charles I went to the scaffold as the
result of divine inspiration from below.
</p>
<p>True, our speaker from the knightly estate proceeds, as we shall
hear later, to describe censorship and freedom of the press, the censored
press and the free press, as <i>two evils,</i> but he does not go so far
as to admit that the press in general is an <i>evil.</i>
</p>
<p>On the contrary! He divides the entire press into "<i>good</i>"
and <i>bad".</i>
</p>
<p>About the <i>bad</i> press, we are told something incredible:
that its aim is badness and the greatest possible dissemination of badness.
We pass over the fact that the speaker has too much confidence in our credulity
when he demands that we should take his word for it and believe in <i>badness
as a profession.</i> We merely remind him of the axiom that everything
human is imperfect. Will not, therefore, the bad press also be imperfectly
bad, and therefore good, and the good press imperfectly good, and therefore
bad?
</p>
<p>The speaker, however, shows us the reverse side. He asserts that
the bad press is better than the good press, for it is always on the <i>offensive</i>,
whereas the good press is on the <i>defensive. </i>But he has himself told
us that man's <i>development</i> ends only with his death. Of course, he
has not told us much by that, he has said nothing but that life ends with
death. But if human life is development and the good press is always on
the defensive, acting only by "defending, restraining and consolidating"
itself, does it not thereby continually oppose development, and therefore
life? Hence either this good defensive press is bad, or development is
the bad thing. In view of this, the speaker's previous assertion, too,
that the aim of the "bad press is the greatest possible dissemination of
bad principles and the greatest possible furtherance of bad frames of mind"
loses its mystical incredibility in a rational interpretation: the bad
feature of the bad press lies in the greatest possible dissemination of
principles and the greatest possible furtherance of a frame of mind.
</p>
<p>The relation of the good press to the bad press becomes still
stranger when the speaker assures us that the good press is <i>impotent</i>
and the bad press <i>omnipotent</i>, for the former is without effect on
the people, whereas the latter has an irresistible effect. For the speaker,
the good press and the impotent press are identical. Does he want to say,
therefore, that what is good is impotent or that what is impotent is good?
</p>
<p>He contrasts the sober voice of the good press to the siren song
of the bad press. But surely a sober voice allows of the best and most
effective singing. The speaker seems to be acquainted only with the sensuous
heat of passion, but not with the hot passion of truth, not with the victory-assured
enthusiasm of reason, not the irresistible ardour of moral powers.
</p>
<p>Under the frames of mind of the bad press he includes "pride,
which recognises no authority in church and state", "envy", which preaches
abolition of the aristocracy, and other things, which we shall deal with
later. For the time being, let us be satisfied with the question: Whence
does the speaker know that this isolated element is the good? If the universal
powers of life are bad and we have heard that the bad is omnipotent, that
it is what influences the masses, <i>what</i> or <i>who</i> has still any
right to claim to be good? The arrogant assertion is this: my individuality
is the good, those few individuals who are in accord with my individuality
are the good, and the wicked, bad press refuses to recognise it. The bad
press!
</p>
<p>If at the beginning the speaker turned his attack on freedom of
the press into an attack on freedom in general, here he turns it into an
attack on the good. His fear of the bad is seen to be a fear of the good.
Hence he founds censorship on a recognition of the bad and a refusal to
recognise the good. Do I not despise a man to whom I say in advance: your
opponent is bound to be victorious in the struggle, because, although you
yourself are a very sober fellow and a very good neighbour, you are a very
poor hero; because, although you bear consecrated arms, you do not know
how to use them; because, although you and I, both of us, are perfectly
convinced of your perfection, the world will never share this conviction;
because, although things are all right as regards your intention, they
are in a bad way as regards your energy?
</p>
<p>Although the speaker's distinction between the good press and
the bad press makes any further refutation superfluous, since this distinction
becomes entangled in its own contradictions, nevertheless we must not lose
sight of the main thing, namely, that the speaker has formulated the question
quite incorrectly and has based himself on what he had to prove.
</p>
<p>If one wants to speak of two kinds of press, the distinction between
them must be drawn from the nature of the press itself, not from considerations
lying outside it. The censored press or the free press, one of these two
must be the good or the bad press. The debate turns precisely on whether
the censored press or the free press is good or bad, i.e., whether it is
in the nature of the press to have a free or unfree existence. To make
the bad press a refutation of the free press is to maintain that the free
press is bad and the censored press good, which is precisely what had to
be proved.
</p>
<p>Base frames of mind, personal intrigues, infamies, occur alike
in the censored and the free press. Therefore the generic difference between
them is not that they produce individual products of this or that kind;
flowers grow also in swamps. We are concerned here with the essence, the
inner character, which distinguishes the censored from the free press.
</p>
<p>A free press that is bad does not correspond to its essence. The
censored press with its hypocrisy, its lack of character, its eunuch's
language, its dog-like tail-wagging, merely realises the inner conditions
of its essential nature.
</p>
<p>The censored press remains bad even when it turns out good products,
for these products are good only insofar as they represent the free press
within the censored press, and insofar as it is not in their character
to be products of the censored press. The free press remains good even
when it produces bad products, for the latter are deviations from the essential
nature of the free press. A eunuch remains a bad human being even when
he has a good voice. Nature remains good even when she produces monstrosities.
</p>
<p>The essence of the free press is the characterful, rational, moral
essence of freedom. The character of the censored press is the characterless
monster of unfreedom; it is a civilised monster, a perfumed abortion.
</p>
<p>Or does it still need to be proved that freedom of the press is
in accord with the essence of the press, whereas censorship contradicts
it? Is it not self-evident that external barriers to a spiritual life are
not part of the inner nature of this life, that they deny this life and
do not affirm it?
</p>
<p>In order really to justify censorship, the speaker would have
had to prove that censorship is part of the essence of freedom of the press;
instead he proves that freedom is not part of man's essence. He rejects
the whole genus in order to obtain one good species, for is not freedom
after all the generic essence of all spiritual existence, and therefore
of the press as well? In order to abolish the possibility of evil, he abolishes
the possibility of good and realises evil, for only that which is a realisation
of freedom can be humanly good.
</p>
<p>We shall therefore continue to regard the censored press as a
bad press so long as it has not been proved to us that censorship arises
from the very essence of freedom of the press.
</p>
<p>But even supposing that censorship and the nature of the press
come into being together, although no animal, let alone an intelligent
being, comes into the world in chains, what follows from that? That freedom
of the press, as it exists from the official viewpoint, that is, the censorship,
also needs censorship. And who is to censor the governmental press, if
not the popular press?
</p>
<p>True, another speaker thinks that the evil of censorship would
be removed by being tripled, by the local censorship being put under provincial
censorship, and the latter in its turn under Berlin censorship, freedom
of the press being made one-sided, and the censorship many-sided. So many
roundabout ways merely to live! Who is to censor the Berlin censorship?
Let us therefore return to our speaker.
</p>
<p>At the very beginning, he informed us that no light would emerge
from the struggle between the good and the bad press. But, we may now ask,
does he not want to make this <i>useless</i> struggle permanent? According
to his own statement, is not the struggle itself between the censorship
and the press a struggle between the good and the bad press?
</p>
<p>Censorship does not abolish the struggle, it makes it one-sided,
it converts an open struggle into a hidden one, it converts a struggle
over principles into a struggle of principle without power against power
without principle. The true censorship, based on the very essence of freedom
of the press, is criticism. This is the tribunal which freedom of the press
gives rise to of itself. Censorship is criticism as a monopoly of the government.
But does not criticism lose its rational character if it is not open but
secret, if it is not theoretical but practical, if it is not above parties
but itself a party, if it operates not with the sharp knife of reason but
with the blunt scissors of arbitrariness, if it only exercises criticism
but will not submit to it, if it disavows itself during its realisation,
and, finally, if it is so uncritical as to mistake an individual person
for universal wisdom, peremptory orders for rational statements, ink spots
for patches of sunlight, the crooked deletions of the censor for mathematical
constructions, and crude force for decisive arguments?
</p>
<p>During our exposal, we have shown how the fantastic, unctuous,
soft-hearted mysticism of the speaker turns into the hard-hearted-ness
of pettifogging mental pragmatism and into the narrowmindedness of an unprincipled
empirical calculation. In his arguments on the relation <i>between the
censorship</i> law and <i>the press law, between preventive</i> and <i>repressive
measures</i>, he spares us this trouble by proceeding himself to make a
<i>conscious application</i> of his mysticism.

<p class="quote">"Preventive or repressive measures, censorship or press law, this alone
is the question at issue, in which connection it would not be inexpedient
to examine somewhat more closely the dangers which have to be removed on
one side or the other. Whereas censorship seeks to prevent what is evil,
the press law seeks by punishment to guard against its repetition. Like
all human institutions, both are imperfect, but the question here is which
is the <i>less</i> so. Since it is a matter of purely spiritual things,
one problem — indeed the most important for both of them — can never
be solved. That is the problem of finding a form which expresses the intention
of the legislator so clearly and definitely that right and wrong seem to
be sharply separated and all arbitrariness removed. But what is arbitrariness
except acting according to individual discretion? And how are the effects
of individual discretion to be removed where purely spiritual things are
concerned? To find the guiding line, so sharply drawn that inherent in
it is the necessity of having <i>to be applied</i> in every single case
in the meaning intended by the legislator, that is the philosopher's stone,
which has not been discovered so far and is hardly likely to be. Hence
arbitrariness, if by that one understands acting according to individual
discretion, is inseparable both from censorship and from the <i>press law.</i>
Therefore we have to consider both in their necessary imperfection and
its consequences. If the censorship suppresses much that is good, the press
law will not be capable of preventing much that is bad. Truth, however,
cannot be suppressed for long. The more obstacles are put in its way, the
more keenly it pursues its goal, and the more resoundingly it achieves
it. But the bad word, like Greek fire, cannot be stopped after it has left
the ballista, and is incalculable in its effects, because for it nothing
is holy, and it is inextinguishable because it finds nourishment and means
of propagation in human hearts."</p>
<p>
The speaker is not fortunate in his comparisons. He is overcome with a
poetic exultation as soon as he begins to describe the omnipotence of the
bad. We have already heard how the voice of the good has an impotent, because
sober, sound when pitted against the <i>siren song of evil.</i> Now evil
even becomes <i>Greek fire,</i> whereas the speaker has nothing at all
with which to compare truth, and if we were to put his "sober" words into
a comparison, truth would be at best a <i>flint</i>, which scatters sparks
the more brightly the more it is struck. A fine argument for slave traders
— to bring out the Negro's human nature by flogging, an excellent maxim
for the legislator — to issue repressive laws against truth so that it
will the more keenly pursue its goal. The speaker seems to have respect
for truth only when it becomes <i>primitive and spontaneous</i> and is
manifested <i>tangibly</i>. The more barriers you put in the way of truth,
the more vigorous is the truth you obtain! Up with the barriers!
</p>
<p>But let us allow the sirens to sing!
</p>
<p>The speaker's mystical <i>"theory of imperfection</i>" has at
last borne its earthly fruits; it has thrown its moonstones at us; let
us examine the moonstones!
</p>
<p>Everything is imperfect. The censorship is imperfect, the press
law is imperfect. That determines their essence. There is nothing more
to say about the <i>correctness of their idea,</i> nothing remains for
us to do except, from the standpoint of the very lowest empiricism, to
find out by calculating probabilities on which side the most dangers lie.
It is purely a difference of time whether measures are taken to prevent
the evil itself by means of censorship or repetition of the evil by means
of the press law.
</p>
<p>One sees how the speaker, by the empty phrase about "human imperfection",
manages to evade the essential, internal, characteristic difference between
censorship and press law and transforms the controversy from a question
of principle into a fairground dispute as to whether more bruised noses
result from the censorship or from the press law.
</p>
<p>If, however, a contrast is drawn between the press law and the
censorship law, it is, in the first place, not a question of their consequences,
but of their basis, not of their individual application, but of their legitimacy
in general. Montesquieu has already taught us that despotism is more convenient
to apply than legality and Machiavelli asserts that for princes the bad
has better consequences than the good. Therefore, if we do not want to
confirm the old Jesuitical maxim that a good end — and we doubt even the
goodness of the end — justifies bad means, we have above all to investigate
whether censorship by its essence is a <i>good</i> means.
</p>
<p>The speaker is right in calling the censorship law a preventive
measure, it is a precautionary measure of the police against freedom, but
he is wrong in calling the press law a repressive measure. It is the rule
of freedom itself which makes itself the yardstick of its own exceptions.
The censorship measure is not a law. The press law is not a measure.
</p>
<p>In the press law, freedom punishes. In the censorship law, freedom
is punished. The censorship law is a law of suspicion against freedom.
The press law is a vote of confidence which freedom gives itself. The press
law punishes the abuse of freedom. The censorship law punishes freedom
as an abuse. It treats freedom as a criminal, or is it not regarded in
every sphere as a degrading punishment to be under police supervision?
The censorship law has only the <i>form</i> of a law. The press law is
a <i>real</i> law.
</p>
<p>The press law is a <i>real law</i> because it is the positive
existence of freedom. It regards freedom as the <i>normal</i> state of
the press, the press as the mode of existence of freedom, and hence only
comes into conflict with a press offence as an exception that contravenes
its own rules and therefore annuls itself. Freedom of the press asserts
itself as a press law, against attacks on freedom of the press itself,
i.e., against press offences. The press law declares freedom to be inherent
in the nature of the criminal. Hence what he has done against freedom he
has done against himself and this self-injury appears to him as a <i>punishment</i>
in which he sees a recognition of his freedom.
</p>
<p>The press law, therefore, is far from being a repressive measure
against freedom of the press, a mere means of preventing the repetition
of a crime through fear of punishment. On the contrary, the <i>absence
of press legislation</i> must be regarded as an exclusion of freedom of
the press from the sphere of legal freedom, for legally recognised freedom
exists in the state as law. Laws are in no way repressive measures against
freedom, any more than the law of gravity is a repressive measure against
motion, because while, as the law of gravitation, it governs the eternal
motions of the celestial bodies, as the law of falling it kills me if I
violate it and want to dance in the air. Laws are rather the positive,
clear, universal norms in which freedom has acquired an impersonal, theoretical
existence independent of the arbitrariness of the individual. A statute-book
is a people's bible of freedom.
</p>
<p>Therefore the <i>press law</i> is <i>the legal recognition of
freedom of the press.</i> It constitutes right, because it is the positive
existence of freedom. It must therefore exist, even if it is never put
into application, as in North America, whereas censorship, like slavery,
can never become lawful, even if it exists a thousand times over as a law.
</p>
<p><i>There are no actual preventive laws.</i> Law prevents only
as a <i>command</i>. It only becomes <i>effective</i> law when it is infringed,
for it is true law only when in it the unconscious natural law of freedom
has become conscious state law. Where the law is real law, i.e., a form
of existence of freedom, it is the real existence of freedom for man. Laws
therefore, cannot prevent a man's actions, for they are indeed the inner
laws of life of his action itself, the conscious reflections of his life.
Hence law withdraws into the background in the face of man's life as a
life of freedom, and only when his actual behaviour has shown that he has
ceased to obey the natural law of freedom does law in the form of state
law compel him to be free, just as the laws of physics confront me as something
alien only when my life has ceased to be the life of these laws, when it
has been struck <i>by illness.</i> Hence a <i>preventive law</i> is a <i>meaningless
contradiction</i>.
</p>
<p>A preventive law, therefore, has within it no <i>measure</i>,
no <i>rational rule</i>, for a rational rule can only result from the nature
of a thing, in this instance of freedom. It is <i>without measure</i>,
for if prevention of freedom is to be effective, it must be as all-embracing
as its object, i.e., unlimited. A preventive law is therefore the contradiction
of an <i>unlimited limitation</i>, and the boundary where it ceases is
fixed not by necessity, but by the fortuitousness of arbitrariness, as
the censorship daily demonstrates <i>ad oculos.</i> <a href="#3" id="a3"><sup class="ednote">[C]</sup></a>
</p>
<p>The human body is mortal by nature. Hence illnesses are inevitable.
Why does a man only go to the doctor when he is ill, and not when he is
well? Because not only the illness, but even the doctor is an evil. Under
constant medical tutelage, life would be regarded as an evil and the human
body as an object for treatment by medical institutions. Is not death more
desirable than life that is a mere preventive measure against death? Does
not life involve also free movement? What is any illness except life that
is hampered in its freedom? A perpetual physician would be an illness in
which one would not even have the prospect of dying, but only of living.
Let life die; death must not live. Has not the spirit more right than the
body? Of course, this right has often been interpreted to mean that for
minds capable of free motion physical freedom of movement is even harmful
and therefore they are to be deprived of it. The starting point of the
censorship is that illness is the normal state, or that the normal state,
freedom, is to be regarded as an illness. The censorship continually assures
the press that it, the press, is ill; and even if the latter furnishes
the best proofs of its bodily health, it has to allow itself to be treated.
But the censorship is not even a learned physician who applies different
internal remedies according to the illness. It is a country surgeon who
knows only a single mechanical panacea for everything, the scissors. It
is not even a surgeon who aims at restoring my health, it is a surgical
aesthete who considers superfluous everything about my body that displeases
him, and removes whatever he finds repugnant; it is a quack who drives
back a rash so that it is not seen, without caring in the least whether
it then affects more sensitive internal parts.
</p>
<p>You think it wrong to put birds in cages. Is not the cage a preventive
measure against birds of prey, bullets and storms? You think it barbaric
to blind nightingales, but it does not seem to you meaningless at all barbaric
to put out the eyes of the press with the sharp pens of the censorship.
You regard it as despotic to cut a free person's hair against his will,
but the censorship daily cuts into the flesh of thinking people and allows
only bodies without hearts, submissive bodies which show no reaction, to
pass as healthy!

<h5>London, Friday, July 1, 1853</h5>
<p class="fst">Since the year 1815 the Great Powers of Europe
have feared nothing so much as an infraction of the <i>status quo</i>.
But any war between any two of those powers implies subversion of that
<i>status quo</i>. That is the reason why Russia's encroachments in the
East have been tolerated, and why she has never been asked for anything
in return but to afford some pretext, however absurd, to the Western powers,
for remaining neutral, and for being saved the necessity of interfering
with Russian aggressions. Russia has all along been glorified for the forbearance
and generosity of her "august master," who has not only condescended to
cover the naked and shameful subserviency of Western Cabinets, but has
displayed the magnanimity of devouring Turkey piece after piece, instead
of swallowing it at a mouthful. Russian diplomacy has thus rested on the
timidity of Western statesmen, and her diplomatic art has gradually sunk
into so complete a <i>mannerism</i>, that you may trace the history of
the present transactions almost literally in the annals of the past.</p>
<p>The hollowness of the new pretexts of Russia is apparent, after
the Sultan [Abdul Mejid] has granted, in his new firman to the Patriarch
of Constantinople [Germanos] more than the Czar himself had asked for --
so far as religion goes. Now was, perhaps, the "pacification of Greece"
<a href="#n1">[1]</a> a more solid pretext? When M. de Villèle,
in order to tranquilize the apprehensions of the Sultan [Mahmud II], and
to give a proof of the pure intentions of the Great Powers, proposed "that
the allies ought above all things to conclude a Treaty by which the actual
<i>status quo</i> of the Ottoman Empire should be guaranteed to it," the
Russian Ambassador at Paris [K. O. Pozzo di Borgo] opposed this proposition
to the utmost, affirming</p>
<p class="quoteb">"that Russia, in displaying <i>generosity in her relations with the
Porte</i>, and in showing <i>inappreciable respect</i> for the wishes of
her allies, [...] had been obliged, nevertheless, to reserve exclusively
to herself to determine her own differences with the Divan; [...] that
a general guarantee of the Ottoman Empire, independently of its being unusual
and surprising, would wound the <i>feelings of his master</i> and the <i>rights</i>
acquired by Russia, and the principles upon which they were founded."</p>
<p>Russia pretends now to occupy the Danubian principalities, without giving
to the Porte the right of considering this step as a <i>casus belli</i>.</p>
<p>Russia pretended, in 1827, "to occupy Moldavia and Wallachia <i>in
the name of the three Powers."</i></p>
<p>While Russia proclaimed the following in her declaration of war
of April 26, 1828:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"Her allies would always find her ready to concert her march with them,
in execution of the Treaty of London <a href="#n2">[2]</a>, and ever anxious
to aid in a work, which her <i>religion</i> and all the sentiments honorable
to humanity recommended to her active solicitude, always disposed to profit
by her actual position <i>only</i> for the purpose of accelerating the
accomplishment of the Treaty of July 6th,"</p>
<p class="fst">
while Russia announced in her manifesto, A. D. 1st October, 1829:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"Russia has remained constantly a stranger to every desire of conquest
-- to every view of aggrandizement."</p>
<p class="fst">
Her Ambassador at Paris was writing to Count Nesselrode.</p>
<p class="quoteb">"When the Imperial Cabinet examined the question, whether it had become
expedient to take up arms against the Porte, [...] there might have existed
some doubt about the urgency of this measure in the eyes of those who had
not sufficiently reflected upon the <i>effects of the sanguinary reforms</i>,
which the Chief of the Ottoman Empire has just executed with such tremendous
violence. [...]</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>"The Emperor has put the Turkish system to the proof, and his
Majesty has found it to possess a commencement of physical and moral organization
which it hitherto had not</i>. If this Sultan had been enabled to offer
us a more determined and regular resistance, while he had scarcely assembled
together the elements of his new plan of reform and ameliorations, how
formidable should we have found him had he had time to give it more solidity.
[...] Things being in this state, we must congratulate ourselves upon having
attacked them before they became more dangerous for us, for delay would
only have made our relative situation worse, and prepared us greater obstacles
than those with which we meet."</p>
<p class="fst">
Russia proposes now to make an aggressive step and then to talk about it.
In 1829 Prince Lieven wrote to Count Nesselrode:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"We shall confine ourselves to generalities, for every circumstantial
communication on a subject so delicate would draw down real dangers, and
if once we discuss with our allies the articles of treaty with the Porte,
we shall only content them when they will <i>imagine</i> that they have
imposed upon us irreparable sacrifices. It is in the midst of our camp
that peace must be signed and it is when it shall have been concluded that
Europe must know its conditions. Remonstrances will then be too late and
it will then patiently suffer what it can no longer prevent."</p>
<p class="fst">
Russia has now for several months been delaying action under one presence
or another, in order to maintain a state of things which, being neither
war nor peace, is tolerable to herself, but ruinous to the Turks. She acted
in precisely the same manner in the period we have alluded to. As Pozzo
di Borgo said:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"It is our policy to see that nothing new happens during the next four
months and I hope we shall accomplish it, <i>because men in general prefer
waiting;</i> but the fifth must be fruitful in events."</p>
<p class="fst">
The Czar, after having inflicted the greatest indignities on the Turkish
Government, and notwithstanding that he now threatens to extort by force
the most humiliating concessions, nevertheless raises a great cry about
his "friendship for the Sultan Abdul Mejid" and his solicitude "for the
preservation of the Ottoman Empire." On the Sultan he throws the "responsibility"
of opposing his "just demands," of continuing to "wound his friendship
and his feelings," of rejecting his "note," and of declining his "protectorate."</p>
<p>In 1828, when Pozzo di Borgo was interpellated by Charles X about
the bad success of the Russian arms in the campaign of that year, he replied,
that, not wishing to push the war <i>à outrance</i> without absolute
necessity, the Emperor had hoped that the Sultan would have profited by
his <i>generosity</i>, which <i>experiment</i> had now failed.</p>
<p>Shortly before commencing her present quarrel with the Porte Russia
sought to bring about a general coalition of the Continental Powers against
England, on the Refugee question, and having failed in that experiment,
she attempted to bring about a coalition with England against France. Similarly,
from 1826 to 1828, she intimidated Austria by the "ambitious projects of
Prussia," doing simultaneously all that was in her power to swell the power
and pretensions of Prussia, in order to enable her to balance Austria.
In her present circular note she indicts Bonaparte as the only disturber
of peace by his pretensions respecting the Holy Places <a href="#n3">[3]</a>;
but, at that time, in the language of Pozzo di Borgo, she attributed</p>
<p class="quoteb">"all the agitation that pervaded Europe to the agency of Prince Metternich,
and tried to make the Duke of Wellington himself perceive that the deference
which he would have to the Cabinet of Vienna would be a drawback to his
influence with all the others, and to give such a turn to things that it
would be no longer Russia that sought to compromise France with Great Britain,
but Great Britain who had repudiated France, in order to join the Cabinet
of Vienna."</p>
<p class="fst">
Russia would now submit to a great humiliation if she retreated. That was
identically her situation after the first unsuccessful campaign of 1828.
What was then her supreme object? We answer in the words of her diplomatist:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"A second campaign is indispensable in order to acquire the superiority
requisite for the success of the negotiation. [...] When this negotiation
shall take place we must be in a state to dictate the conditions of it
in a prompt and rapid manner.... <i>With the power of doing more</i> His
Majesty would consent to <i>demand less</i>. [...] To obtain this superiority
appears to me what ought to be the aim of all our efforts. <i>This superiority
has now become a condition of our political existence</i>, such as we must
establish [...] and maintain in the eyes of the world."</p>
<p class="fst">
But does Russia not fear the common action of England and France? Certainly.
In the Secret Memoirs on the Means possessed by Russia for breaking up
the alliance between France and England, revealed during the reign of Louis
Philippe, we are told:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"In the event of a war, in which England should coalesce with France,
Russia indulges in no hope of success. unless that union [...] be broken
up; so that at the least England should consent to remain neutral during
the continental conflict."</p>
<p class="fst">
The question is: Does Russia believe in a common action of England and
France? We quote again from Pozzo di Borgo's dispatches:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"From the moment that the idea of the ruin of the Turkish Empire ceases
to prevail, it is not probable that the British Government would risk a
general war for the sake of exempting the Sultan from acceding to such
or such condition, above all in the state in which things will be at the
commencement of the approaching campaign, when everything will be as yet
uncertain and undecided. These considerations would authorize the belief
that we have no cause to fear an open rupture on the part of Great Britain;
and that she will content herself with counseling the Porte to beg peace,
and with lending the aid of the good offices in her power during the negotiation
if it takes place, without going further, should the Sultan refuse or we
persist."</p>
<p class="fst">
And as to Nesselrode's opinion of the "good" Aberdeen, the Minister of
1828, and the Minister of 1853, it may be well to quote the following from
a dispatch by Prince Lieven:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"Lord Aberdeen reiterated in his interview with me the assurance that
at no period it had entered into the intentions of England to seek a quarrel
with Russia -- that he feared that the position of the English Ministry
was not well understood at St. Petersburg -- that he found himself in a
delicate situation. Public opinion was always ready to burst forth against
Russia. The British Government could not constantly <i>brave</i> it; and
it would be dangerous to excite it on questions [...] that touched so nearly
the national prejudices. On the other side we could reckon with entire
confidence upon the [...] friendly dispositions of the English Ministry
which struggled against them."</p>
<p class="fst">The only thing astonishing in the note of M. de Nesselrode, of June 11,
is not "The insolent melange of professions refuted by acts, and threats
veiled in declaimers," but the reception Russian diplomatical notes meet
with for the first time in Europe, calling forth, instead of the habitual
awe and admiration, blushes of shame at the past and disdainful laughter
from the Western world at this insolent amalgamation of pretensions, finesse
and real barbarism. Yet Nesselrode's circular note, and the "ultimatissimum"
of June 16, are not a bit worse than the so much admired master-pieces
of Pozzo di Borgo and Prince Lieven. Count Nesselrode was at their time,
what he is now, the diplomatical head of Russia.</p>
<p>There is a facetious story told of two Persian naturalists who
were examining a bear; the one who had never seen such an animal before,
inquired whether that animal dropped its cubs alive or laid eggs; to which
the other, who was better informed, replied: "That animal is capable of
anything." The Russian bear is certainly capable of anything, so long as
he knows the other animals he has to deal with to be capable of nothing.</p>
<p><i>En passant</i>, I may mention the signal victory Russia has
just won in Denmark, the Royal message having passed with a majority of
119 against 28, in the following terms:</p>
<p class="quoteb">"In agreement with the 4th paragraph of the Constitution d. d. June
5, 1849, the United Parliament, for its part, gives its consent to the
arrangement by His Majesty of the succession to the whole Danish Monarchy
in accordance with the Royal message respecting the succession of Oct.
4, 1852, renewed June 13, 1853."</p>

<h3>[ Chartism ]</h3>
<p class="fst">Strikes and combinations of workmen are proceeding
rapidly, and to an unprecedented extent. I have now before me reports on
the strikes of the factory hands of all descriptions at Stockport, of smiths,
spinners, weavers, etc., at Manchester, of carpet-weavers at Kidderminster,
of colliers at the Ringwood Collieries, near Bristol, of weavers and roomers
at Blackburn, of roomers at Darwen, of the cabinet-makers at Boston, of
the bleachers, finishers, dyers and power-loom weavers of Bolton and neighborhood,
of the weavers of Barnsley, of the Spitalfields broad-silk weavers, of
the lace makers of Nottingham, of all descriptions of workingmen throughout
the Birmingham district, and in various other localities. Each mail brings
new reports of strikes; the turn-out grows epidemic. Every one of the larger
strikes, like those at Stockport, Liverpool, etc., necessarily generates
a whole series of minor strikes, through great numbers of people being
unable to carry out their resistance to the masters, unless they appeal
to the support of their fellow-workmen in the Kingdom, and the latter,
in order to assist them, asking in their turn for higher wages. Besides
it becomes alike a point of honor and of interest for each locality not
to isolate the efforts of their fellow-workmen by submitting to worse terms,
and thus strikes in one locality are echoed by strikes in the remotest
other localities. In some instances the demands for higher wages are only
a settlement of long-standing arrears with the masters. So with the great
Stockport strike.</p>
<p>In January, 1848, the mill-owners of the town made a general reduction
of 10 per cent. from all descriptions of factory-workers' wages. This reduction
was submitted to upon the condition that when trade revived the 10 per
cent. was to be restored. Accordingly the work-people memorialized their
employers, early in March, 1853, for the promised advance of 10 per cent.;
and as they would not come to arrangements with them, upward of 30,000
hands struck. In the majority of instances, the factory-workmen affirmed
distinctly their <i>right</i> to <i>share</i> in the prosperity of the
country, and especially in the prosperity of their employers.</p>
<p>The distinctive feature of the present strikes is this, that they
began in the lower ranks of unskilled labor (not factory labor) actually
trained by the direct influence of emigration, according to various strata
of artizans, till they reached at last the factory people of the great
industrial centers of Great Britain; while at all former periods strikes
originated regularly from the heads of the factory-workers, mechanics,
spinners, &amp;c., spreading thence to the lower classes of this great
industrial hive, and reaching only in the last instance, to the artizans.
This phenomenon is to be ascribed solely to emigration.</p>
<p>There exists a class of philanthropists, and even of socialists,
who consider strikes as very mischievous to the interests of the "workingman
himself," and whose great aim consists in finding out a method of securing
permanent average wages. Besides, the fact of the industrial cyclus, with
its various phases, putting every such average wages out of the question.
I am, on the very contrary, convinced that the alternative rise and fall
of wages, and the continual conflicts between masters and men resulting
therefrom, are, in the present organization of industry, the indispensable
means of holding up the spirit of the laboring classes, of combining them
into one great association against the encroachments of the ruling class,
and of preventing them from becoming apathetic, thoughtless, more or less
well-fed instruments of production. In a state of society founded upon
the antagonism of classes, if we want to prevent Slavery in fact as well
as in name, we must accept war. In order to rightly appreciate the value
of strikes and combinations, we must not allow ourselves to be blinded
by the apparent insignificance of their economical results, but hold, above
all things, in view their moral and political consequences. Without the
great alternative phases of dullness, prosperity, over-excitement, crisis
and distress, which modern industry traverses in periodically recurring
cycles, with the up and down of wages resulting from them, as with the
constant warfare between masters and men closely corresponding with those
variations in wages and profits, the working-classes of Great Britain,
and of all Europe, would be a heart-broken, a weak-minded, a worn-out,
unresisting mass, whose self-emancipation would prove as impossible as
that of the slaves of Ancient Greece and Rome. We must not forget that
strikes and combinations among the serfs were the hot-beds of the mediaeval
communes, and that those communes have been in their turn, the source of
life of the now ruling bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>I observed in one of my last letters, of what importance the present
labor-crisis must turn out to the Chartist movement in England, which anticipation
I now find realized by the results obtained in the first two weeks of the
reopened campaign by Ernest Jones, the Chartist leader. The first great
open-air meeting was, as you know, to be held on the mountain of Blackstone-Edge.
On the 19th ult., the Lancashire and Yorkshire delegates of the respective
Chartist localities congregated there, constituting themselves as Delegate-Council
Ernest Jones's petition for the Charter was unanimously adopted as that
proposed to emanate from the meetings in the two counties, and the presentation
of the Lancashire and Yorkshire petitions was voted to be entrusted to
Mr. Apsley Pellatt, M. P. for Southwark, who had agreed to undertake the
presentation of all Chartist petitions. As to the general meeting, the
most sanguine minds did not anticipate its possibility, the weather being
terrific, the storm increasing hourly in violence and the rain pouring
without intermission. At first there appeared only a few scattered groups
climbing up the hill, but soon larger bodies came into sight, and from
an eminence that overlooked the surrounding valleys, thin but steady streams
of people could be viewed as far as the eye could carry, through the base
pelting of the rain, coming upward along the roads and footpaths leading
from the surrounding country. By the time at which the meeting was announced
to commence, upward of 3,000 people had met on the spot, far removed from
any village or habitation, and during the long speeches, the meeting, notwithstanding
the most violent deluge of rain, remained steadfast on the ground</p>
<p>Mr. Edward Hooson's resolution: "That the social grievances of
the working classes of the country are the result of class-legislation,
and that the only remedy for such class-legislation is the adoption of
the people's Charter," was supported by Mr. Gammage, of the Chartist Executive,
<a href="#n4">[4]</a> and Mr. Ernest Jones, from whose speeches I give
some extracts.</p>
<p class="quoteb">"The resolution which has been moved attributed the people's [...]
grievances to class-legislation. He thought that no man who had watched
the course of events could disagree with that statement. The House of Commons,
so called, had turned a deaf ear to all their complaints, and when the
wail of misery had arisen from the people, it had been mocked and derided
by the men who assumed to be the representatives of the nation, and if
by any singular chance the voice of the people found an echo in that House,
it was always drowned in the clamor of the murderous majority of our class-legislators.
[Loud applause.] The House of Commons not only refused to do justice to
the people, but it even refused to inquire into their social condition.
They would all recollect that sometime ago, Mr. Slaney had introduced into
the House a motion for the appointment of a standing commission. whose
business it should be to inquire into that condition and suggest measures
of relief -- but such was the determination of the House to evade the question,
that on the introduction of the motion, only twenty-six members were present,
and the House was counted out. [Loud cries of shame, shame.] And on the
reintroduction of that motion, so far from Mr. Slaney being successful,
he (Mr. Gammage) believed that out of 656 honorable men, but 19 were present
even to enter on a discussion of the question. [...] When he told them
what was the actual condition of the people, he thought they would agree
with him, that there existed abundant reasons for inquiry. They were told
by political economists that the annual production of this country was
£820,000,000. Assuming that there were in the United Kingdom 5,000,000
of working families, and that such families received an average income
of fifteen shillings per week, which he believed was a very high average
compared with what they actually received [cries of "a great deal too high"],
supposing them, however, to average this amount, they received out of their
enormous annual production a miserable one hundred and ninety-five millions,
-- [cries of shame]. -- and all the rest went into the pockets of idle
landlords, usurers and the capitalist class generally.... Did they require
a proof that these men were robbers? [...] They were not the worst of thieves
who were confined within the walls of our prisons; the greatest and cleverest
of thieves were those who robbed by the power of laws made by themselves,
and these large robberies were the cause of all the smaller ones that were
transacted throughout the country.... Mr. Gammage then entered into an
analysis of the House of Commons, proving [...] that from the classes to
which the members of that House belonged, and the classes which they represented,
it was impossible that there should exist the smallest sympathy between
them and the working millions. In conclusion, said the speaker, the people
must become acquainted with their Social Rights."</p>
<p class="fst">
Mr. Ernest Jones said:

<p class="quoteb">"To-day we proclaim that the Charter shall be law. [Loud cheers.] I
ask you how to reengage in this great movement, because I know that the
time has arrived for so doing, and that the game is in your hand, and because
I am anxious that you should not let the opportunity go by. Brisk trade
and emigration have given you a momentary power, and upon how you use that
power depends your future position. If you use it only for the objects
of the present, you will break down when the circumstances of the present
cease. But if you use it, not only to strengthen your present position,
but to secure your future one, you will triumph over all your enemies.
If brisk trade and emigration give you power, that power must cease when
brisk trade and emigration cease, and unless you secure yourself in the
interval, you will be more slaves than ever. [Hear, hear.] But the very
sources that cause your strength now will cause your weakness before long.
The emigration that makes your labor scarce, will make soon your employment
scarcer.... The commercial reaction will set in, and now I ask you, how
are you preparing to meet it? [...] You are engaged in a noble labor movement
for short time and high wages, and you are practically carrying it through
to some extent, [...] but mark! you are not carrying it through Parliament.
Mark! the game of the employer is this -- amuse them with some concessions,
but yield to them no law. Don't pass a Wages bill in Parliament, but concede
some of its provisions in the factory. [Hear.] The wages slave will then
say, "Never mind a political organization for a Ten Hours bill or a Wages
measure -- we've got it, ay, ourselves without Parliament." Yes, but can
you keep it without Parliament? What gave it you? Brisk trade. What will
take it from you? Dull trade. [...] Your employers know this. [...] Therefore,
they shorten your hours of work or raise your wages, or remit their stoppages,
in hopes that you will forego the political organization for these measures.
[Cheers.] They shorten the hours of work, well knowing that soon they will
run their mills short time -- they raise your wages, well knowing that
soon they will give thousands of you no wages at all. But they tell you
also -- the midland manufacturers -- that, even if the laws were passed,
this would only force them to seek other means of robbing you -- that was
the plain meaning of their words. So that in the first place, you can't
get the acts passed, because you have not got a People's Parliament. In
the second place, if they were passed, they tell you that they would circumvent
them. [Loud cries of "hear."] Now, I ask you, how are you preparing for
the future? How are you using the vast strength you momentarily possess?
[...] That [...] you will be powerless, unless you prepare now -- you will
lose all you may have gained; and we are here to-day to show you how to
keep it and get more. [...] Some people fancy a Chartist organization would
interfere with the Labor movement. Good Heaven! it is the very thing to
make it successful.... The employed cannot do without the employer unless
he can employ himself. The employed can never employ himself, unless he
can command the means of work -- land, credit and machinery. He can never
command these, unless he breaks down the landed, moneyed and mercantile
monopolies, and these he cannot subvert except by wielding sovereign power.
Why do you seek a Ten Hours bill? If political power is not necessary to
secure labor-freedom why go to Parliament at all? Why not do in the factory
at once? Why, because you know, you feel, you by that very act admit tacitly,
that political power is needed to obtain social emancipation. [Loud cheers.]
Then I point you to the foundation of political power -- I point you to
the suffrage -- I point you to the Charter. [Enthusiastic applause.] ...
It may be said: "Why do we not wait till the crisis comes, and the millions
rally of their own accord." Because we want not a movement of excitement
and danger, but one of calm reason and moral strength. We will not see
you led away by excitement, but guided by judgment -- and therefore we
bid you now reorganize -- that you may rule the storm, instead of being
tossed by it. Again, continental revolution will accompany commercial reaction
-- and we need to raise a strong beacon of Chartism to light us through
the chaos of tempest. [...] To-day, then, we reinaugurate our movement,
and to obtain its official recognition, we go through the medium of Parliament
-- not that we expect them to grant the petition -- but because we use
them as the most fitting mouth-piece to announce our resurrection to the
world. Yes, the very men that proclaimed our death, shall have the unsought
pleasure to proclaim our resurrection, and this petition is merely the
baptismal register announcing to the world our second birth." [Loud cheers.]</p>
<p class="fst">
Mr. Hooson's resolution and the petition to Parliament were here, as well
as at the subsequent meetings during the week, enthusiastically accepted
by acclamation.</p>
<p>At the meeting of Blackstone-Edge, Ernest Jones had announced
the death of Benjamin Ruston, a workingman who seven years before, had
presided at the great Chartist meeting held at the same spot <a href="#n5">[5]</a>;
and he proposed that his funeral should be made a great political demonstration,
and be connected with the West Riding meeting for the adoption of the Charter,
as the noblest obsequies to be given to that expired veteran. Never before
in the annals of British Democracy, has such a demonstration been witnessed,
as that which attended the revival of Chartism in the West Riding, and
the funeral of Benjamin Ruston, on Sunday last [June 26, 1853], when upward
of 200,000 people were assembled at Halifax, a number unprecedented even
in the most excited times. To those who know nothing of English society
but its dull, apoplectic surface, it should be recommended to assist at
these workingmen's meetings and to look into those depths where its destructive
elements are at work.</p>
<p>The Coalition has gained the preliminary battle on the Indian
question, Lord Stanley's motion for delay of legislation having been rejected
by a majority of 182 votes [In the House of Commons on June 30, 1853].
Pressure of matter obliges me to delay my comments upon that division.</p>

<p class="fst"><a id="n2"></a><span class="term">[2]</span> The <i>London conferences</i> of the
representatives of Britain, Russia and France were held in 1827-29 and
discussed the Greek question. On July 6, 1827, the three powers signed
a Convention which confirmed the Protocol on Greek autonomy signed by Britain
and Russia in St. Petersburg on April 4 1826. Both the Protocol and the
Convention contained clauses on the diplomatic recognition of Greece as
an independent state and armed mediation in the Turko-Greek conflict. On
the basis of this Convention the allied fleet was sent into Greek waters
and took part in the battle of Navarino. A number of other documents concerning
Greece were also signed, including a Protocol of March 22 1829, which established
the borders of the Greek state and provided for a monarchical form of government
in Greece. However, these agreements and the steps taken by Britain and
France, who hoped to settle the conflict through diplomacy, without a defeat
for Turkey in the Russo-Turkish was, could not make Turkey change her attitude
on the Greek question. It was only after the victory of the Russian army
under General Diebich in the 1829 campaign that Turkey agreed to make some
concessions.</p>

measures" if these demands were rejected. This ultimatum, which Marx calls
below and "ultimatissimum", was presented to the Porte on June 16 1853.</p>

A reference to the Executive Committee
of the National Charter Association founded in July 1840. The Association
was the first mass workers' party in the history of the working-class movement
and had up to 50,000 members at the height of the Chartist movement. However,
a lack of ideological and tactical unity and a certain looseness in its
organization affected its activities. After the defeat of the Chartists
in 1848 and the ensuing split in their ranks, the Association lost its
mass character. Nevertheless, under the leadership of Ernest Jones and
other revolutionary Chartists, it fought for the revival of Chartism on
a socialist basis, which found its expression in the programme adopted
by the Chartist Convention in 1851. The Association ceased its activities
in 1858.</p>

A reference to the Blackstone-Edge
meeting organized by the Chartists on August 2 1846. The meeting in which
Ernest Jones took part was held on June 19 1853.</p>

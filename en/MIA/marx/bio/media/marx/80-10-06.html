One of the most remarkable men of the day, who
has played an inscrutable but puissant part in the revolutionary politics
of the past forty years, is Karl Marx. A man without desire for show or
fame, caring nothing for the fanfaronade of life or the pretence of power,
without haste and without rest, a man of strong, broad, elevated mind,
full of far-reaching projects, logical methods, and practical aims, he
has stood and yet stands behind more of the earthquakes which have convulsed
nations and destroyed thrones, and do now menace and appal crowned heads
and established frauds, than any other man in Europe, not excepting Joseph
Mazzini himself. The student of Berlin, the critic of Hegelianism, the
editor of papers, and the old-time correspondent of the <i>New York Tribune</i>,
he showed his qualities and his spirit; the founder and master spirit of
the once dreaded International and the author of "Capital", he has been
expelled from half the countries of Europe, proscribed in nearly all of
them, and for thirty years past has found refuge in London. He was at Ramsgate
the great seashore resort of the Londoners, while I was in London, and
there I found him in his cottage, with his family of two generations. The
saintly-faced, sweet-voiced, graceful woman of suavity who welcomed me
at the door was evidently the mistress of the house and the wife of Karl
Marx. And is this massive-headed, generous-featured, courtly, kindly man
of 60, with the bushy masses of long revelling gray hair, Karl Marx? His
dialogue reminded me of that of Socrates -- so free, so sweeping, so creative,
so incisive, so genuine -- with its sardonic touches, its gleams of humor,
and its sportive merriment. He spoke of the political forces and popular
movements of the various countries of Europe -- the vast current of the
spirit of Russia, the motions of the German mind, the action of France,
the immobility of England. He spoke hopefully of Russia, philosophically
of Germany, cheerfully of France, and sombrely of England -- referring
contemptuously to the "atomistic reforms" over which the Liberals of the
British Parliament spend their time. Surveying the European world, country
after country, indicating the features and the developments and the personages
on the surface and under the surface, he showed that things were working
toward ends which will assuredly be realized. I was often surprised as
he spoke. It was evident that this man, of whom so little is seen or heard,
is deep in the times, and that, from the Neva to the Seine, from the Urals
to the Pyrenees, his hand is at work preparing the way for the new advent.
Nor is his work wasted now any more than it has been in the past, during
which so many desirable changes have been brought about, so many heroic
struggles have been seen, and the French republic has been set up on the
heights. As he spoke, the question I had put, "Why are you doing nothing
now?" was seen to be a question of the unlearned, and one to which he could
not make direct answer. Inquiring why his great work "Capital", the seed
field of so many crops, had not been put into English as it has been put
into Russian and French from the original German, he seemed unable to tell,
but said that a proposition for an English translation had come to him
from New York. He said that that book was but a fragment, a single part
of a work in three parts, two of the parts being yet unpublished, the full
trilogy being "Land", "Capital", "Credit" , the last part, he said, being
largely illustrated from the United States, where credit has had such an
amazing development. Mr. Marx is an observer of American action, and his
remarks upon some of the formative and substantive forces of American life
were full of suggestiveness. By the way, in referring to his "Capital",
he said that any one who might desire to read it would find the French
translation much superior in many ways to the German original. Mr. Marx
referred to Henri Rochefort the Frenchman, and in his talk of some of his
dead disciples, the stormy Bakunin, the brilliant Lassalle, and others,
I could see how his genius had taken hold of men who, under other circumstances,
might have directed the course of history.

<p>The afternoon is waning toward the twilight of an English summer
evening as Mr. Marx discourses, and he proposes a walk through the seaside
town and along the shore to the beach, upon which we see many thousand
people, largely children, disporting themselves. Here we find on the sands
his family party -- the wife, who had already welcomed me, his two daughters
with their children, and his two sons-in-law, one of whom is a Professor
in King's College, London, and the other, I believe, a man of letters.
It was a delightful party -- about ten in all -- the father of the two
young wives, who were happy with their children, and the grandmother of
the children, rich in the joysomeness and serenity of her wifely nature.
Not less finely than Victor Hugo himself does Karl Marx understand the
art of being a grandfather; but, more fortunate than Hugo, the married
children of Marx live to cheer his years. Toward nightfall he and his sons-in-law
part from their families to pass an hour with their American guest. And
the talk was of the world, and of man, and of time, and of ideas, as our
glasses tinkled over the sea. The railway train waits for no man, and night
is at hand. Over the thought of the babblement and rack of the age and
the ages, over the talk of the day and the scenes of the evening, arose
in my mind one question touching upon the final law of being, for which
I would seek answer from this sage. Going down to the depth of language,
and rising to the height of emphasis, during an interspace of silence,
I interrogated the revolutionist and philosopher in these fateful words,
"<i>What is?"</i> And it seemed as though his mind were inverted for a
moment while he looked upon the roaring sea in front and the restless multitude
upon the beach. <i>"What is?"</i> I had inquired, to which, in deep and
solemn tone, he replied: "<i>Struggle!"</i>
</p>
<p>
At first it seemed as though I had heard the echo of despair;
but, peradventure, it was the law of life.

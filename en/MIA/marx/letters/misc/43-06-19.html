No. 51
<p>
  In the year one thousand eight hundred and forty-three, on the nineteenth of the month of June, at 10 a.m., there appeared before me, Franz Buss, Chief Burgomaster of Kreuznach, Registrar for Births, Deaths and Marriages, Karl <i>Marx</i>, aged twenty-five, born  in  Trier,  administrative  district of Trier, Doctor of

Philosophy, resident in Cologne, administrative district of Cologne, major son of Heinrich Marx, deceased, in his lifetime King's Counsel, resident in Trier, administrative district of Trier, and of Henriette Pressburg, of no profession, resident in Trier, administrative district of Trier.</p>
<p>And Johanna Bertha Julie Jenny von Westphalen, aged twenty-nine, born at Salzwedel, administrative district of Magdeburg, of no               particular occupation: resident in Kreuznach, administrative of Coblenz, major daughter of Johann Ludwig von Westphalen, deceased, in his lifetime Privy Councillor, resident in Trier, administrative district of Trier, and of Carolina Heubel, of no profession, resident in Kreuznach, administrative district of Coblenz.</p>
<p> The bridegroom's mother consents to the intended marriage by the deed of consent quoted below and the bride's mother by her
personal presence. In the deed of consent of the bridegroom's mother the Christian name of the bride's father is given as
Ferdinand, but it is Johann Ludwig, as follows from the sworn declaration made before us by the bride and the four witnesses present, after they had previously declared that they knew him closely and well.</p>
<p>The same requested me to perform legally the marriage agreed
upon between them. As the prescribed public announcements of this marriage were actually read twice before the main door of the Kreuznach Town Hall, namely, the first on Sunday, the twenty-first of May, and the second on the following Sunday, the twenty-eighth of May, one thousand eight hundred and forty-three, and as the documents of the announcement were duly posted up
publicly and no objection to the marriage was lodged, I, in order to comply with the said request, read out the following documents:</p>
<p>a) the birth certificate of the bridegroom, and</p>
<p> b) the death certificate of his father, both certificates drawn up by Chief Burgomaster Gortz and Assistant Thanisch in Trier under the date of the thirtieth and twenty-eighth of January this year;</p>
<p>c) the deed of consent of his mother, recorded by Notary Funck in Trier under the date of the twenty-eighth of January this year; </p>
<p>d) the birth certificate of the bride, furnished by the Royal Consistorial Councillor and Pastor of the Church of Saint Mary at Salzwedel under the date of the eleventh of February this year; </p>
<p>e) the death certificate of her father, furnished by Assistant Thanisch in Trier under the date of the twenty-third of February
this year;</p>
<p>  f) the attestation of the announcement in Cologne, furnished by the Registrar for Births, Deaths and Marriages Schenk in that city under the date of the fourteenth of June this year; </p>
<p>g) the attestation of the announcement in Bonn, furnished by the Registrar for Births, Deaths and Marriages Gerhard in that city under the date of the sixteenth of the current month and year, and read out aloud Chapter Six of the part dealing with marriage in the Civil Code of Law and thereupon asked the above-named bridegroom and bride whether they wished to be joined in wedlock.</p>
<p>  As each of them separately answered this question affirmatively, I declared in the name of the law that Karl Marx and Johanna Bertha Julie Jenny von Westphalen were legally married.</p>
<p>  Of this I drew up the present document in the presence of Dr. Karl Engelmann, aged thirty-five, a physician, resident in Kreuznach, a friend of the newly married couple; of Heinrich Balthasar Christian Clevens, aged thirty, a probationer notary, resident in Kreuznach, a friend of the newly married couple; of Elias Mayer, aged sixty-four, man of private means, resident in Kreuznach, a friend of the newly married couple; and of Valentin Relier, aged fifty-six, innkeeper, resident in Kreuznach, a friend of the newly married couple. Then the persons present signed the document with me after it had been read out to them.</p>

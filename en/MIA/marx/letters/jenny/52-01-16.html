<h4>[London, 16 January 1852]</h4>
<p>Dear Mr Engels,</p>
<p>As you see, I am still <i>en fonction</i> as secretary. My husband has still not altogether left his bed. He was indeed very poorly. Tomorrow he will attempt to take a short walk. His illness prevented him from getting anything done for America, although he did manage to strike some sparks out of Freiligrath and Pieper. I enclose herewith a most felicitous poem of Freiligrath’s. Let our friend Weerth have a look at it as well. Perhaps he too will feel inspired to climb onto Pegasus. Send us the <i>Tribune</i> if you have finished with it. Next week you will receive a very nice letter from Cluss. Lupus hasn’t got it just now. We hope to hear from you soon and may you enjoy your <strong>pale ale</strong> in the meantime.</p>
<p class="sig">Warm regards from the patient.<br>
Jenny Marx</p>

<h4>[London, about 12 April 1857]</h4>
<p>Dear Mr Engels,</p>
<p>One invalid is writing for another by <i>ordre du mufti</i> <span class="context">[i.e. for Karl]</span>. Chaley’s <span class="context">[i.e. Karl's]</span> head hurts him almost everywhere, terrible tooth-ache, pains in the ears, head, eyes, throat and God knows what else. Neither opium pills nor creosote do any good. The tooth has got to come out and he jibs at the idea. Now I am appealing to you to step into the breach with an article for Friday. No matter what subject. *There was, for instance, the sending of troops and ships for China, there was also a change in the organisation of the Russian army, or Bonaparte or Switzerland or yarn or anything else. One column will do.* Assuming, of course, that you've got over your own eye-trouble. If you possibly can, drop us a note to let us know whether you are able to do the article. Did the eye lotion help at all?</p>
<p>Warm regards from</p>

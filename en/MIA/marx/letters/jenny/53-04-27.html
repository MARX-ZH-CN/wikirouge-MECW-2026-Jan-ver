<h4>[London, 27 April 1853]</h4>
<p>Dear Mr Engels,</p>
<p>It is for me a hateful task to have to write to you about money matters. You have already helped us all too often. But this time I have no other recourse, no other way out. I have written to Hagen in Bonn, to Georg Jung, to Cluss, to my mother-in-law, to my sister in Berlin. Ghastly letters! And so far not a word from a single one of them. So there’s no other course left open to us. I cannot describe what things are like here. My husband has gone to the City to see Gerstenberg. You can imagine what kind of an errand that must be for him. Meanwhile I am writing these lines. Can you send us something? The baker warned us that there'd be no more bread after Friday. Yesterday when he asked: ‘<strong>is Mr Marx at home?</strong>’ Musch managed to fend him off by answering: ‘No, <strong>he a'nt upstairs</strong>’ and then, with three loaves tucked under his arm, shot off like an arrow to tell his Moor about it.</p>
<p class="sig">Farewell.<br>
